    <title>What is the point of the Census?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/03/21/what-is-the-point-of-the-census/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I duly filled in my Census to comply with the law and ordered the email receipt to be able to prove it.  As we now live in a snooper state where government keeps so many records about us it is difficult to fathom why they need to conduct a census. </p>
<p>They know who I am , where I live, where I work and all the details I supplied for my National Insurance number, Passport and driving licence. They have Income  tax records, National Insurance records, residence records for Council Tax, health records through the NHS ,a birth,  marriage and divorce record. So why do they need to know again who I am, where I live, what my general state of health is, what job I do and what my marital status is despite knowing all this already? They also wanted to know a few  of the qualifications I hold, all known to the Examining Boards and Universities which are part of a government guided educational system.</p>
<p>They might argue that the point of the Census is to catch up with a minority who have  not duly complied with all the form filling needed by everyone from the Passport office to the Council Tax desk. I fear that if people are housing illegal migrants  or covering for people dodging Income Tax and national Insurance  they are unlikely to blow their cover by providing honest answers to the census form. </p>
<p>They might also argue it helps them plan future services and policies. If that is the purpose then it would need to be more precise and detailed than the form they provided. Let’s take the possible use of census data for a skills audit and future skills policy. The form did  not allow someone to explain what professional qualifications they might have, made no distinction between the three main  levels of degree to encompass research oriented doctorates as opposed to first degrees, and did not press home general enquiries about apprenticeships to discover which areas were best served. Asking people to make a general assessment of their health is hardly sufficient evidence to plan NHS capacity. The GPS  know much more about their patients. The multiple questions about identity and background were more detailed than some other areas. </p>
<p>Of course good government needs good data. Instead of spending money on another general  survey the government should clean up and use the huge quantities of data it already holds. Why  not start by reconciling National Insurance numbers with employee and Income Tax records? Why have more NI numbers been issued that there are meant to be employees? Why not use the substantial NHS data held on all  using the service to model future patterns of service need and capacity  better? Why not improve a system of patient records with non UK users receiving bills?  Why not ask for consolidated data from Examining Boards and Universities to improve national data over skills and education if they think there are holes in their current knowledge?</p>
<p>It is even more bizarre that the census will not take place in Scotland when on its own logic  it needs to be U.K. wide. </p>
<p>I hope this is the last general Census we face. On the general topic of population numbers and migration what we want is a reliable total available monthly, with good systems and border controls to assure us that the numbers are accurate. All those welcome to come legally should be included in the moving totals as permits are issued on arrival, with effective controls against illegals. For the working age population it should be one person, one NI number. </p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi receives jab her at the Eagles Arena.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle Central, took her turn to receive the covid19 vaccination at the Eagles Arena in Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi was able at a social distance to meet the Clinical Director, NHS and Tyne and Wear Fire Service staff, as well as many of the local volunteers as she was shown how the site was organised to enable many residents of Newcastle to be safely and speedily vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her vaccination and visit Chi said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I am so happy I have had my vaccine! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ Constituents had told me how well organised the vaccinations were at the Arena but I was still impressed by the warmth of the support, the guidance offered and the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; speed of pain free vaccination I received.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ The covid safety awareness and precautions on site were obvious to anyone and   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;immediately helped me feel safe and relaxed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Onwurah added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ I would encourage everyone to take up the offer to get a covid jab as it is a simple and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;safe process with enormous benefits to the individual, their family and friends, as well as &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to the communities in which we live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233372" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/womens-safety-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/womens-safety-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/womens-safety-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/womens-safety-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/womens-safety-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/womens-safety.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;We’ve all been shocked and appalled at the terrible news about Sarah Everard over the past couple of weeks. It’s impossible to comprehend the impact that the news will have had on her family and friends and my thoughts are with them at what must be an incredibly difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Along with an outpouring of grief, there has been a lot of justifiable anger, both that incidents like this are still taking place and that there has not been enough of a priority given to the safety of women and girls. Because sadly this case was not a one-off, but part of a much wider pattern of violence, intimidation, abuse and harassment of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Almost every woman has stories of being followed at night, inappropriate touching on public transport, sexual comments in the workplace, catcalling when going about their business or other forms of harassment. A survey in 2017 found that over half a million women aged between 16 and 59 had experienced a sexual assault in the previous year, whilst 85,000 had experienced rape or attempted rape.&lt;span class="apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;These horrifying statistics highlight the sheer scale of this problem, which I think is sometimes underplayed because it’s a difficult topic to talk about. But it’s important that we do have this discussion and – most importantly – that this conversation is led by women. It is vital that we listen to the negative experiences that women and girls go through on an everyday basis, often from a far too early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Sadly, many women also experience these incidents being ignored, side-lined or downplayed by institutions that should be there to protect and safeguard them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Some men get very defensive in debates on this topic, feeling that they are under attack for something that they haven’t done, but I think it’s important that we all think about what we can do to deal with this problem. There are of course some things that need to be done on a national level or by organisations and institutions, including reviewing legislation and sentencing guidelines, improving training and education in the police and elsewhere, and having a proper national strategy in place to deal with misogyny and gender-based violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;However, there are also things that all men can do, including challenging harassment when you come across it and changing behaviour in order to be less threatening, for instance perhaps by crossing the street if you’re walking behind a woman at night. Whether we’re dealing with this issue at a national level or as an individual, the best solutions will always come from listening to women and understanding their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-47/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This week the Welsh Labour Government have announced a £500 bonus for all NHS and social care staff in Wales in recognition of their enormous effort over the past year in looking after the sick and vulnerable, keeping our health and care sector going, and vaccinating tens of thousands of people. We are so proud of our very own heroes in scrubs and PPE, and I am delighted we have been able to recognise their work in this way.</p>
<p>The APPG for Mutuals is conducting an enquiry into the planned demutualisation of Liverpool Victoria known as LV. On 15th December 2020, LV announced that it had reached an agreement on the terms of sale to Bain Capital, a leading US private investment firm specialising in private equity. LV is one of the largest financial mutuals in the UK. The APPG is keen to explore the reasons for the sale and the wider impact. We held our second evidence session and heard from Barry O’Dwyer, Group Chief Executive of Royal London. Mr O’Dwyer joined Royal London in September 2019 and has extensive experience in financial services, including actuary, Pensions and Savings, Standard Life, and sits on the Board of the Association of British Insurers. The APPG will produce and publish its report at the conclusion of all evidence sessions.</p>
<p>The APPG for Hospitality and Tourism, of which I am vice-chair, are conducting an inquiry into saving the UK’s town and city centres post Covid-19. Our second evidence session looked at policy renewal and the future role of government, and we heard from Chris Murray, director of Core Cities Group, Nicola Taylor, CEO of Charlton Hotels, Will Stratton-Morris, UK CEO of Cafe Nero, and Kate Shane, Head of Merlin Entertainments. The APPG will produce and publish a report which will include recommendations to the UK Government at the conclusion of all evidence sessions. Next week we will hear evidence about a green recovery for sustainable hospitality and tourism.</p>
<p>This week’s meeting of the Gaps in Support APPG heard evidence about Parents and Carers in the Film and TV sector. We heard evidence from Hope Dickson Leach and Line Langebeck, co-founders of Raising Films, an organisation which supports, promotes and campaigns for parents and carers in the UK screen sector, and is calling on the UK screen sector to recognise the value of its parent and carer members. Raising Films challenges the UK screen sector to ensure that best working practices are available, prevent loss of talent, and grow numbers in this very valuable part of the screen sector.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic, but will be going ahead in July 2021. The APPG for Olympics and Paralympics, of which I’m a vice-chair, met this week for an update on the status of the Games from Mark Adams, Director of Communications at the International Olympic Committee and from Pierre Ducrey, the Operations Director at the IOC. Pierre has been liaising with the Tokyo Organising Committee and National and International Health Authorities every day to put in place safety mechanisms for the forthcoming Games.</p>
<p>The Western Gateway APPG was formed as a key forum to assist economic prosperity development by providing an open platform for academics, businesses, and policy experts to engage in a two-way dialogue with Parliamentarians, regarding the Gateway economic partnership between the West of England and South Wales. The Western Gateway was launched in November 2019, and is a cross border partnership of local authorities, city regions, local enterprise partnerships, Welsh and UK Government. It focuses on three ambitions: world class connectivity across the Gateway to boost productivity, and deliver sustainable transport, turn the region into a global gateway for export and investment led growth, increasing innovation and collaboration amongst high tech sectors, universities and R&amp;D assets. At this week’s APPG meeting we heard about the progress made on the Gateway’s Independent Economic Review, following the UK Government’s funding announcement of £800 million to the Gateway for 2021-22.</p>
<p>I was honoured to be elected vice-chair of the APPG for Post-Brexit Funding, which has been renamed the APPG for Shared Prosperity Fund. Professor Steve Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam University gave a presentation on the UK Government plans set out in the November 2020 Spending Review, and further details included in the Chancellor’s Budget on 3rd March. The UK Tory Government stated many times before, during and post Brexit that Wales would not receive a penny less after Brexit than it received from EU Structural Funds. And that there would be no power grab, whereby the UK Government take back powers from the Welsh Labour Government in contrary to the devolved settlement. However, the new Community Renewal Fund, which is the forerunner of the UKSPF, and the new Levelling Up Fund will be delivered by UK Government with no involvement of the devolved nations. Local authorities have been grouped into tiers of priority of need, and will bid directly to the UK Government for funding for local projects in competition with all other regions of the UK.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, I was proud to be one of the guest speakers at the Co-operative Party Women’s Network <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCacPKYt-F4zFc0O-1MEncew/videos">“Be the Change” Zoom event</a> highlighting International Women’s Day. The other panel speakers were Cllr Antoinette Bramble, Deputy Mayor of Hackney and Deputy Leader of the Labour Group on the Local Government Association and Elaine Dean, who is the former President and current Vice-President of Central England Co-operative. “Be the Change” focused on what is preventing women becoming representatives within society, how this has changed over time, and how women can build a society where power and wealth can be shared. The event was chaired by Sandra Wilson, Chair of the Co-operative Party Women’s Network and we were joined by over fifty women co-operators from all over the UK who spoke passionately about their personal circumstances during the interactive breakout sessions which followed the panel. Massive thanks to Issy Oozeerally, Events Co-ordinator at the Co-operative Party, for bringing together such a successful event.</p>
<p>The story of Banwen’s connection to the kidnapping of St Patrick was discovered by former miner, writer and lifelong Banwen resident, George Brinley Evans. Now 95 years of age, George came across Patrick’s autobiography in a national magazine when George was in school in the 1930s. Patrick’s autobiography “<em>Confessio”</em> stated that he was abducted from a Roman settlement in the West of Britain. The article claimed that Patrick’s home Taburnaie Bannavem was Tafarn y Banwen, which George knew was the farm that George’s grandfather rented from the colliery. George was instrumental in getting the Welsh St Patrick stone erected at the side of Roman Road and every year we hold a St Patrick’s Day celebration at the stone, compered by Roy Noble, with speeches, singing and attended by local school children. This could not take place this year, due to coronavirus restrictions, so we held the first ever zoom event. The virtual celebration featured a new poem about the kidnapping of Patrick and his sister Darerca written especially for the event by award-winning writer Menna Elfyn, who is the chair of PenCymru that campaigns for writers around the world who are persecuted and imprisoned. Ahead of the virtual event, South Wales artist Mel Bastier, made some new sculptures which she placed at the stone.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it is Down’s Syndrome Awareness Day, which is another of those days that has gained new significance during the lockdown, with many groups fighting for the needs and rights of those with a disability to be properly recognised. Just because someone has a disability doesn’t mean that they cannot make any decisions for themselves, participate fully in society, and build a life for themselves. There are some fantastic stories on the <a href="https://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/news-category/people-with-downs-syndrome/">Down’s Syndrome Association</a> website about some of the amazing work that people with Down’s are involved with. Reece works with his mum making colourful books that encourage children to open up and talk about difficult subjects through Art Therapy. Mohammad has become a YouTuber to show people his cooking skills after being inspired by Jamie Oliver. Alison lives alone and is looking forward to what the end of lockdown will bring, and I think we can all empathise with that.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch on any matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop me and my staff an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <title>Bradford MUST have a Northern Powerhouse Rail stop</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/bradford-must-have-a-northern-powerhouse-rail-stop/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Judith, alongside Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of the council and Tracy Brabin, candidate for West Yorkshire Mayor, has called for the Government to ensure there is a Northern Powerhouse Rail stop in the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Representing all three of Bradford&amp;#8217;s Labour MPs, Judith said: &amp;#8220;There is a world out there that would open up with an NPR stop here in Bradford city centre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would increase our opportunities for job search, it would mean our businesses thrive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a massive deal for Bradford, I can’t think of anything bigger at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking during a Health statement in Parliament today, Tim said: "There was no mention of cancer in the Secretary of State's statement, nor a single penny in the Budget to boost cancer services, despite the fact that Macmillan Cancer Support's figures show the need to increase all cancer services by 110% for a solid 15 months, starting now, to clear the cancer backlog.</summary>

<p><em>"Macmillan also says that there are 37,000 people with cancer who are not even in the system yet.</em></p>
<p><em>"Given the scale of this crisis, will the Secretary of State agree to set out an urgent, ambitious and funded plan to catch up with cancer, so that tens of thousands of people do not unnecessarily lose their lives?"</em></p>
<p>Responding, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: <em>"The need to catch up on the backlog is there across all elective operations and of course that includes those for cancer.</em></p>
<p><em>"The good news is that the NHS has worked incredibly hard, especially in this second peak, to make sure that cancer services have remained working and effective as much as possible. Some cancer services have in fact delivered more than their normal pre-pandemic levels of care.</em></p>
<p><em>"The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that we have to make sure that any backlog is reduced-that is a critical part of what I have been talking about today."</em></p>

    <title>Debbie welcomes Dame Julie Walters’ Support on Dementia Research Funding</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/debbie-welcomes-dame-julie-walters-support-on-dementia-research-funding/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>As Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, I welcome Dame Julie Walters’ support in calling on the Government to deliver on its election promise to double funding for dementia research.</p>
<p>This comes as Alzheimer’s Research UK reveals 94% of dementia researchers are very concerned progress is at risk due to fewer funding opportunities. While new polling from the charity has highlighted that UK adults think the pledge made during the 2019 election is important, very few believe government will follow through on its word.</p>
<p>This week the UK’s leading dementia research charity has revealed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over three quarters (77%) of the public believe the Government’s pledge to increase its funding for dementia research to over £160 million a year is either still important (59%) or more important (18%) since the coronavirus outbreak.</li>
<li>One in five people (18%) think it is even more important because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen people with dementia among the hardest hit.</li>
<li>Despite this, only 7% of people believe the Government will deliver on the promise made during the 2019 election.</li>
<li>Yet the charity says the funding is more critical than ever before, as a separate survey shows one in five researchers are considering leaving, or have already left, dementia research due to COVID-19 – while more than a third (34%) are considering leaving research altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am delighted to see Dame Julie pressing the Government to keep the promise it made to the public.  I wrote to the Prime Minister in November urging him to keep his promise on the dementia ‘moonshot’ and also to the Chancellor last month, ahead of the Budget.  Unfortunately neither have yet replied and I share the concern of those surveyed that the Government will break its promise.</p>
<p>Like many people, including Dame Julie, I have family experience of dementia – my mother had Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. I know just how important research is into understanding the condition and looking for treatments to prevent, slow, and ultimately cure diseases that cause dementia.</p>
<p>It’s been well over a year since the government pledged to boost dementia research, after this was included in the Conservative 2019 General Election manifesto. But with no indication that this funding is to be delivered, it’s time for action.</p>
<p>While it’s right that the response to the pandemic has had to take priority, dementia is not just the UK but the world’s greatest long-term health crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the lives of people affected by dementia and their carers have been devastated, with a staggering 34,000 people with dementia estimated to have died from coronavirus since March 2020. The search for life-changing dementia treatments has never been more critical.</p>
<p>Our life sciences sector both in academia and industry showed what we can do together in response to Covid-19. In the same way, I believe we can lead the world in finding cures for the diseases which cause dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Dame Julie Walters said: </strong></p>
<p>“As someone who witnessed the effects of dementia growing up, I am proud to be standing with the tens of thousands of people who are calling on government to deliver on its election promise to double investment into researching the condition. My grandmother had vascular dementia and she lived with us when we were kids. We didn’t really understand her symptoms, but we all loved her to bits. I still don’t know how my mother coped having to care for her and look after three young children.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that over half of us know someone affected by dementia, yet there are no treatments to slow, stop or prevent it. Far too many families are being forced to experience the pain dementia causes on a daily basis because of the lack of treatments and to put it simply, enough is enough.</p>
<p>“There is an urgent need for research to bring about life-changing treatments for people affected by dementia. With the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on those with the condition, the funding promised by government is more critical now than it ever has been and it’s clear the public agrees. I’d urge everyone to sign this petition, so we can make it clear to government that we will not let their promise be cast aside.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;The Boots store in Stornoway is to introduce instore PCR testing from April. By doing testing in the morning and using the Royal Mail 24-hour delivery service they will be able to get samples to the laboratory within the required period for a 48-hour response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the store will also be receiving one of the new instore testing devices in the first week of April. This machine undertakes rapid antigen testing and can give results within minutes for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This follows representations that Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MSP Alasdair Allan and MP Angus MacNeil have made to health retailers to address the lack of private testing in the islands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angus MacNeil MP commented:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was delighted to hear from Boots today that they will be introducing PCR testing in Stornoway from April. This is something which I had been discussing with them for some time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I worked with local offshore workers to provide Boots with a long list of firms who employ workers from the islands and they are now looking to engage with those firms regarding the new instore testing devices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is very positive news and will overcome one of the challenges which has faced those in employment away from their island homes during the pandemic.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alasdair Allan MSP commented:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is really good news from Boots and I am grateful for them in taking the islands situation into account in their rollout of testing stations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As the pandemic has gone on and countries have introduced testing requirements at their borders this has presented real problems for those who work abroad or at sea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I hope that this new facility in the Stornoway store will help ensure that those islanders working away will be able to spend more time with their loved ones when on leave.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin Smyth MP hails social workers as the “forgotten frontline” during the pandemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has hailed social workers across Bristol as one of the “forgotten frontlines” throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Ahead of World Social Work Day on the 16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; March, Smyth has praised the hard work, selflessness and bravery of social workers who support some of the most vulnerable people and families across Bristol South.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The British Association of Social Workers (BASW), which represents over 21,000 social workers across the UK, has been supporting social workers throughout the pandemic, including campaigning for access to testing and safe access to health and care settings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ms Smyth is also supporting World Social Work Month, a series of online events and activities to celebrate and champion social work in the UK and internationally.&amp;nbsp; The majority of events are free to attend and open to both socials workers and anyone who wants to learn more about the profession.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You can find out more about World Social Work Month here:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.basw.co.uk/what-we-do/world-social-work-day-and-month-activities-2021"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;https://www.basw.co.uk/what-we-do/world-social-work-day-and-month-activities-2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Social workers have played an essential but often unheralded role of supporting people throughout the pandemic, including people with learning disabilities, older people in residential care, children at risk, and those with additional and complex needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“With the number of people needing this type of support rising over the last year, the pressure on social workers is increasing.&amp;nbsp; We must ensure that the Government understand the resourcing, recognition and development foundations for great social work, so we can support our social workers to continue doing their incredible work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I am proud to champion social workers in Bristol South, and stand with them this World Social Work Month.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, was last weekend accompanied by South East Holderness Ward Councillor Lyn Healing, and Withernsea Mayor, Councillor Dave Edwards to inspect the skatepark in Withernsea after concerns were raised with him by a resident about its poor condition.</p>
<p>The Withernsea MP arranged the visit after reading a ‘Letter to the Editor’ in the Holderness Gazette, which argued that improvements should be made to the park.</p>
<p>The concrete ramps are vandalised and under them are beer bottles, crisp packets, empty plastic containers and an array of sharp objects.</p>
<p>The skatepark was created by Withernsea and Holderness Play Action Group, a charity established by the late mayor of Withernsea, Keith Hardcastle, who worked to bring outdoor and leisure opportunities for young people in Withernsea. With no-one to lead the charity, responsibility for the skatepark’s maintenance has been inherited by Withernsea Town Council. </p>
<p>At the site visit, Graham was disappointed to see the overgrown nature of the site and that because of its relative isolation the site has become a venue for underage drinking and occasional drug use.</p>
<p>Cllr Lyn Healing commented, “I was very disappointed in the appearance of the skatepark, particularly the amount of rubbish that is there. I will be speaking to Withernsea Town Council, East Riding Council and Active Withernsea to see if there is a possibility of working together to repair and maintain the park once more.</p>
<p>“I am aware that the park is still used for skateboarding and after speaking to frequent visitors they would very much like to see it brought back up to specification”</p>
<p>Since his visit, Graham has written to the Minister for Civil Society, Baroness Barran, to see if funding from central government is available to have the park restored.</p>
<p>Graham added, “It’s sad to see a park with so much potential falling into disrepair. I will do what I can to help the town find the money to have it restored.</p>
<p>“That’s easier said than done, of course – there has to be funding available to keep the park maintained and this is something I’ll be looking into along with making sure that there’s political will. From speaking with Cllrs Healing and Edwards today, it’s clear that the will’s there.”</p>
<p>Cllr Dave Edwards said, “It’s because it’s so secluded, that’s the problem. If we pretend the area doesn’t exist and leave it to be abandoned, then naturally its facilities will be abused for purposes for which they weren’t intended.”</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2021/03/action-to-help-young-carers-in-worcester/"><![CDATA[<p>Local MP Robin Walker has called on businesses in Worcester to help young carers into work to mark Young Carers Action Day. Robin met with a group of young carers on Friday (March 12<sup>th</sup>) in a meeting organised by the organisation Worcestershire Young Carers. He heard about the challenges young carers face and learned about the many skills young carers can offer employers.</p>
<p>The meeting took place as YSS Worcestershire Young Carers joined other young carers organisations across the UK to raise awareness during Young Carers Action Day 2021. The event, organised by Carers Trust, has been running for 6 years and is dedicated to highlighting the impact that being a carer can have on young people. This year, the event feels particularly important due to the significant impact that the covid19 pandemic has had on all young people but particularly those already made vulnerable by being a carer.</p>
<p>Robin said:</p>
<p>“When I met with young carers in my constituency on Friday I was overwhelmingly impressed by their commitment and will do all I can to help.</p>
<p>“I call on all businesses in my constituency to consider the skills a young carer have to offer. Sacrificing their own time to look after a loved takes a great deal of maturity and in the process, young people inevitably learn many of the transferable skills that employers are often looking for during the recruitment process.</p>
<p>“Worcester Sixth Form College assists young carers with their responsibilities with a Designated Young Carers Lead. Worcestershire Young Carers are campaigning to get that support for every school. I will be liaising with colleagues in government to see how we can support this.”</p>
<p>Jon Cawdron, Team Manager WYC, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This day, is the most important in our calendar in terms of placing a spotlight on what it is to be a young carer and the impact it can have. We are thrilled to be using it to not only raise awareness of the ways that young people in a care role can be marginalised and have fewer life chances but also to highlight the skills that many of them have developed and the maturity they demonstrate in undertaking their roles. They are heroes and this day gives them a chance to show off their superpowers.”</p>
<p>Funded by BBC Children in Need, The Worcestershire Young Carers Participation Group meets regularly to highlight the needs of young carers, and helps get their voices heard by organisations and services that affect them.</p>

              <p>A Greater London Authority report published in May 2020 highlights that more than half of all deaths within London attributable to emissions from waste incineration facilities occur within just nine boroughs. The research clearly shows Barking and Dagenham and Havering as having the highest concentration of particulates and other harmful emissions as a direct result of incineration.</p>
              <p>One month prior to the report the government rubber stamped plans to develop a second Energy from Waste incinerator directly next to the existing one in Belvedere on the banks of the Thames, <strong>with the Secretary of State claiming: </strong><em>"The overall conclusion is that the impacts of the Development on air quality as it affects human health and environmental receptors is acceptable."</em></p>
              <p>The report went hand in hand with Jon Cruddas MP’s call for a judicial review into the decision which was supported by the Mayor of London. However, the judicial review was dropped in September 2020 after a two-year campaign due to the likelihood of failure and cost to the taxpayer.</p>
              <p><strong>Jon Cruddas MP commented:</strong> <em>“I hadn’t seen the GLA report into Energy from Waste incinerators at the time. This document makes the decision to drop the judicial review even more frustrating, when City Hall’s own research shows the damaging affect this development will have across Dagenham and Rainham.”</em></p>
              <p>
                <em>“I completely understand the concern around financial pressures, especially given the events of the past year, but it is still disappointing that the government has been let of the hook at the expense of my constituent’s health.”</em>
              </p>
              <p>Development of the Riverside Energy Park is due to begin later this year. When completed the site will produce a maximum of 120 milligrams per cubic metre of Nitrous Oxide which falls well under the 200 mpcm European directive. However, combined with the max output of the existing site it is anticipated that the area will produce the highest rate of harmful EfW emissions in the country.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jon added: </strong>
                <em>“It is unbelievable that this has been given the green light and deemed ‘acceptable’ by government when we consider the wealth of evidence against it. Energy from Waste does not contribute to a circular economy and is a step away from the government’s own green growth commitments.”</em>
              </p>
              <p>In the coming months Jon has committed to work alongside other key stakeholders to ensure that proper scrutiny mechanisms are in place to monitor operations at the Belvedere EfW site.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span>Ludlow MP, Philip Dunne, has praised the work of the whole team behind the refurbishment of Ludlow Assembly Rooms, ahead of the building being handed back by Shropshire Council and its contractors, Paveway. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>With formal completion of the building works due in coming days, the Trust will soon be able to work on fitting out the new Box Office, Visitor Information Centre, bar, and café/restaurant. This will hopefully be completed in time for the lifting of coronavirus restrictions for indoor venues currently expected from 17th May. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Shropshire Council as landlord has funded almost £2m into the scheme of the £3.5m scheme, with hundreds of thousands of pounds also raised by Ludlow Assembly Rooms volunteers. Grant funding has also come from the European Regional Development Fund, one of the last capital projects funded by the EU. The Arts Council England has been a supportive funder throughout, including providing a further £130,000 boost in December 2020 as part of the Government’s Cultural Recovery Fund. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Mr Dunne has taken a close interest throughout the development of this project, stepping in when funding or other issues arose, to help bring together the various organisations involved to secure their commitment, and ensure the project could be completed.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“I am absolutely delighted that Ludlow Assembly Rooms has emerged from the scaffolding and can now be seen in its prominent place on the market square in its fine new livery. Having visited the site at various stages of the refurbishment, I can confirm that this has been a far more complex and involved refurbishment than originally envisaged, as several problems emerged which had not been identified from the original investigations. What emerges soon for all to see is a building which will host all kinds of events for decades to come, in an environmentally sustainable building. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>“<span><span><span><span>I pay tribute to the brilliant work of everyone involved, from Ludlow Assembly Rooms trustees, resolutely chaired by Gareth Williams and lead by volunteer Chief Executive Helen Hughes, to the 200 or so regular volunteers, in their determination to get to this point. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>“<span><span><span><span>Ludlow Assembly Rooms is the key cultural venue for South Shropshire and I congratulate Shropshire Council for investing such significant funding into this major refurbishment of such an iconic building in the heart of Ludlow.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>“<span><span><span><span>I congratulate all who have been involved and look forward to Ludlow Assembly Rooms opening to the public later this Spring.”</span></span></span></span></p></div>

            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, has today called on her constituents and all residents right across Birmingham to ask that they take part in Census 2021.</p>
<p>The census, which has been happening for over 200 years, will ask questions about every household to build a picture of British society. It also helps the Government by providing them with information so that informed decisions can be made around funding and service requirements for local areas. </p>
<p>For example, the last census in 2011 showed that in Edgbaston there were 39,709 households; 1,925 families with three or more dependent children and just over 14% of the local population declaring themselves retired. This information has guided the Government, Birmingham City Council and the West Midlands Combined Authority for the last decade on decision-making around how many new homes were needed to be built in Bartley Green, how many school places were necessary in Quinton and what healthcare requirements there were in Harborne.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “It’s imperative that everyone completes the census. Not only will it help to inform local government but it is your opportunity to stand up and be counted. To play your part and help get public organisations put the right services in place, for your local community.”</p>
<p>Census Day is on Sunday 21 March, but households will now be receiving letters. Census 2021 will be digital first. This means that letters will be posted to houses with access codes that explain how to complete the forms online. However, paper copies can be requested if that is preferred.</p>
<p>Gill continued, “With the move by the ONS to make the census digital first, it’s even  easier this year to complete. You can fill it in on your phone, tablet or laptop and it should only take you about ten minutes.”</p>
<p>Language support is available by calling freephone 0800 587 2021 and for any further questions, please visit <a href="http://www.census.gov.uk/">www.census.gov.uk</a></p>

    <title>RELEASE: Research Reveals Majority of UK Firms Feeling Brexit Bite</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It’s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham Labour will agree a package of budget proposals to establish a sustainable financial footing amid the Covid crisis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This budget comes during an extremely difficult time for the people of Nottingham, the nation as a whole and the council. The impacts of Covid have been devastating. The health effects coupled with the economic situation has dealt a blow to many of our residents. During this most difficult time for our City the council has stepped up to support our most vulnerable residents and taken on new responsibilities ranging from getting every rough sleeper into safe accommodation to administering tens of millions of pounds worth of business grants to help small employers through the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham City Council has had to make over £271m of budget savings between 2010/11 and 2019/20, and during the current pandemic has had to deal with £25.9m unreimbursed Covid response costs and loss of income. We are having to take difficult decisions in this budget which includes £15.6m of savings.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Proposals include some service changes, as well as a workforce reduction of 272 full-time equivalent posts – 109 of which have been held vacant. We will also be implementing the Government’s proposed 3% social care precept towards the rising costs of care services for elderly and vulnerable adults, which now accounts for over 35% of the council’s net budget.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last couple of months we have been listening to the feedback on draft budget proposals and will be making a few changes as a result. We will be:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrapping the staffing reduction to the Missing Children’s Team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrapping the proposed 30p charge for public toilets in the City.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing the grants to arts and cultural venues with a much smaller 15% funding reduction rather than the 37% that had been considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many proposals in today’s budget that we are bringing reluctantly. To avoid similar decisions in the future we need the Government to change course.  We will be using Full Council today to call on the Government to urgently address a number of issues which will be significant for the Council’s budget and financial stability over the coming years including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The need to bring forward the promised Green Paper on Adult Social Care with a funding model that does not rely on continued increases in Council tax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services for vulnerable children where provider pricing nationally is spiralling – Nottingham City Council is facing an estimated additional cost pressure of more than £12m over the coming year&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further support for  businesses and employment services which will be&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>High Speed Rail Bridge Consultation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://liambyrne.co.uk/high-speed-rail-bridge-consultation/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;img width="150" height="150" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HS2-image-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important information about new High Speed (HS2) bridges at Saltley viaduct and the Aston Church Road&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I need your help putting forward views about two new bridges being built for HS2 &lt;strong&gt;at Saltley Viaduct and the Aston Church Road, as they will cut road links for a year, beginning in mid-2022.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the new High Speed 2 rail line is a game changer for our area. A train journey to Manchester will take just 41 minutes and a trip to London will take 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is expected to create jobs, jobs, jobs: thousands of new jobs around the new station at Birmingham International &amp;#8211; and thousands more in the city centre &amp;#8211; plus up to 3,600 jobs at the new business park I’ve fought for at the old LDV-Alstom site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, building the line will cause disruption not least because the bridges at Saltley Viaduct and Aston Church Road have to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lot of work has already gone into replacement plans and timing of the construction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can fill in the consultation survey online by going to&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/HS2-Saltley-KDE/
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or if you don’t have the internet call the freephone number on 08081 434 434.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to check out the new HS2 Jobs Board https://www.hs2.org.uk/supply-chain-jobs&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve battled hard over five years in Parliament to make sure HS2 works for us. This is a big bit of new infrastructure for us and I’m anxious we get it right. So please make sure you have your say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welwyn Hatfield MP Receives First Dose Of COVID-19 Vaccination</title>

				&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local MP and Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps thanks NHS staff and volunteers as he urges people: ‘when you get the call for your vaccine- go and get it’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Shapps MP yesterday attended the vaccination centre at the University of Hertfordshire College Lane Campus in Hatfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre caters for 4 different GP surgeries in Hatfield and currently vaccinates around 350 people per day. The centre is organised so that people are vaccinated by the staff from their own GP surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps becomes the first cabinet minister to have received a jab for the coronavirus, having had treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma 21 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival, Mr Shapps took a lateral flow test to make sure he was not bringing COVID into the vaccination centre. He spoke to volunteers and staff outside the centre before entering to have his first dose, and tour the centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving the jab, Mr Shapps said: “I received my call from the GP surgery to come for my first vaccination- actually I was so surprised to receive the call I actually called back and checked they got it right. Turns out that it’s because a couple of decades ago I had cancer and have been in remission for a very long time from that- but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to have my jab and then have a little tour to thank the volunteers and NHS staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing is this: when you’re called for your jab, make sure you book it in and make sure you go and get it, and together we can protect each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps released a video on the day of his vaccination, which can be viewed below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Commenting, Mark Pritchard MP said:</p>
<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus &#8211; support for local businesses &amp; high streets:</span></strong></p>
<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>
<p>I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement of the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of April 2021, and the extension of the business loan schemes until the end of March.

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>Welcoming the Fantastic Ryanair Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianpaisleymp.co.uk/2016/01/11/welcoming-the-fantastic-ryanair-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br/>
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br/>
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br/>
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br/>
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br/>
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br/>
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br/>
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br/>
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
