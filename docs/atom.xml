    <title>Anti-Social Behaviour: Worksop </title>

    <title>Inflation and recession</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We have the inflation. It is important to avoid the recession. It looks as if we will see peak inflation this autumn as the official forecasts now concede. The delayed increases in domestic heating bills will adversely affect the inflation numbers then and hit people’s budgets again at the next increase.</p>
<p>Next year inflation should come down. It is difficult to believe the prices of the basics could go up again by the magnitudes of the increases this year. Money policy this year is a lot tighter, whereas it was too loose last year. The economy is being slowed by the Bank’s policy and their higher interest rates, and by the big hit to real incomes caused by soaring fuel and food prices. Many  people are responding by having to cut back on some discretionary spending to afford the basics. The reduction in demand from these measures will help cool prices.</p>
<p>It does not need a wide range of tax rises on top of the forces slowing the economy. VAT cuts on energy would  be helpful, both by cutting the prices of some of the dearest items in budgets, and by returning a bit of cash to people who otherwise have to pass the money to the fuel companies, suppliers and government energy taxes.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost of living not on Chancellor’s radar says Isles MP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has reacted with dismay that the Chancellor has no plans to increase the Rural Fuel Rebate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak in March calling for an increase to the Rural Fuel Rebate and the response received from Helen Whately, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury confirms that there are no plans to change the Rural Fuel Rebate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Rural Fuel Rebate was introduced in 2012 after many years of heavy lobbying by Mr MacNeil and others to take 5p off a litre of fuel in island and other rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Mr MacNeil said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As inflation hits 9.1%, the highest and fastest rate in 40 years, people are struggling to make ends meet as the cost of living continues to rise.&amp;nbsp; I had asked the Chancellor to increase the Rural Fuel Rebate from 5p a litre to 10p a litre, this request has been woefully brushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the UK we have a weak exchange rate which is increasing the cost of living.&amp;nbsp; It is worth noting that in the summer of 2008, the oil price was much higher in dollar terms than it is now but because the pound has fallen by 40% against the dollar, the price at the fuel pumps is approximately 50% higher than it was 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rather than taking action to help families, the Tories choose to make the rich richer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Scotland is an energy-rich country but sadly being in the UK we are not getting the benefits of our vast resources.&amp;nbsp; The UK is hampering and harming Scotland and only with independence can we get out of this mess.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span><span>Rivers are the lifeblood of our communities, and I am always struck by the special place that many of them have in our hearts, with many writing in regularly to state their desire to see more done to protect them – whether that be from storm overflows or sewage treatment work overspill, or simply by enhancing the habitat and biodiversity offer they provide for so many local species.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why, as part of my ongoing work to tackle flooding AND boost local water management and resilience in our part of the world, I welcomed the opportunity to learn more about Anglian Water’s ‘Get River Positive’ initiative.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Anglian Water, in partnership with their neighbours at Severn Trent Water, are investing over £50 million before 2030 so as to create new wetlands across the region. The first three wetlands near Charsfield and Cotton (both in Suffolk) and Stagsden (Bedfordshire) are planned to get underway  next year – with a further 23 potential sites in the final stages of feasibility work too. 3 of these potential sites, I am told, are excitingly in Mid Norfolk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With East Anglia the fastest growing region in the UK, the wetlands initiative is a major step forward to improving resilience using nature-based solutions without the need for carbon-hungry infrastructure and additional chemical usage. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Anglian Water’s five core commitments to ‘Get River Positive’ are:​</span></span></span></p>

<ul><li><span><span><span><span>Ensure storm overflows and sewage treatment works do not harm rivers. ​</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Create more opportunities for everyone to enjoy our region's rivers. (their target is to have a designated bathing water within an hour for 90% of AW customers – e.g. coastal, Rutland Water plus certain rivers being assessed now).​</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Support others to improve and care for rivers. ​</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Enhance local rivers and create new habitats so wildlife can thrive. ​</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Be open and transparent about AW’s performance and plans. ​</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span>Furthermore, by maintaining, extending and enhancing their ‘offer’ in this way, Anglian Water can make our local water management systems more robust in the face of future pressures.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I am sure everyone will agree that this is positive news – not just in terms of tackling flooding by boosting flood resilience in our region, but also in terms of enhancing the local environment and improving water quality.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I look forward to learning more, as well as visiting later this year some of the wetland projects being run here in Mid Norfolk by the likes of Anglian Water and the Norfolk Rivers Trust.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <title>Let the City of Culture win transform Bradford</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/let-the-city-of-culture-win-transform-bradford/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The moment it was announced that Bradford had won the City of Culture 2025 title is a moment I will never forget. The crowds gathered in City Park erupted in cheers and applause at the sheer joy and immense pride of winning the title. I have said it many times in the past three weeks but it deserves to be said again: Congratulations Bradford!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while we are sure to enjoy all sorts of exciting cultural events across Bradford District during our year with the crown, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The City of Culture title is not just twelve months for Bradford to shine in the national limelight. It is a transformative opportunity for the city to unlock its potential and make sure Bradford’s light keeps burning brightly for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous title winners have seen tens of millions of pounds of long-term investment – and there is no reason why Bradford can’t do better. Bradford is the youngest, most entrepreneurial city in the country and study after study has shown it is the city with most to gain from levelling up and investment. Our City of Culture win is an unmissable opportunity to leverage investment, funding and ideas into the city. It is about raising Bradford’s profile and making the case that we are open for business. It is a chance to showcase Bradford businesses to the world and to show that if you’re a company, then Bradford is a thriving place to come and do businesses too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to make the most of this springboard opportunity, families and businesses need support with the day-to-day struggle of making ends meet right now. I know times continue to be hard today but, what is worse, is that the country is on track to face an even harsher energy and cost of living crisis this winter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January, Labour proposed a one-off windfall tax on North Sea oil and other gas producers who are raking in obscene profits while ordinary people struggle, as a way to fund help with soaring energy costs. It took five months for the Government to finally accept that this was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From January to May, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak left families, older people and those already pushed to breaking point worried, panicking and stuck because the Government failed to act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have long been calling on the Government to take action. In September 2021, I raised my concerns regarding our dwindling natural gas reserves directly with the Business Secretary and challenged the Government’s decision to stop investing in gas storage. I was met with meaningless rhetoric about future energy diversification and no plan – right before an energy crisis caused by a surge in wholesale gas prices. Then in May this year, we heard how the UK had a huge surplus of gas &amp;#8211; but that we had nowhere to store it, while announcements were made that as many as six million households could face power cuts because of gas shortages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just people here that are being hit by the cost of energy; it is affecting local businesses too. Some are facing astronomical energy bills as the energy price cap does not apply to businesses. I visited one energy-intensive manufacturer recently who told me their energy bills have skyrocketed from £7 million to £35 million a year. When I asked the Business and Energy Minister what plans the Government had to support businesses like this, the Minister simply dismissed this as an ‘extreme case’ – yet I am hearing that this is the story up and down the country. The government needs to listen to businesses and step in to help them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is important. Bradford’s manufacturing industry is part of the city’s heritage. Over 24,000 people in the city work in manufacturing, making it the fourth biggest city for manufacturing in the country. Energy intensive industries across the UK like steel, food production, basic chemicals and building materials are essential to our everyday lives. Hardworking workers plough in hour after hour to keep these industries going. How can we expect to be able to showcase the best of Bradford when rising energy costs means businesses and residents alike are fighting to keep their heads above the water?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make the most of its City of Culture win, Bradford needs its residents and businesses to be thriving. We need the national Government to get the basics right on this: Act now to properly support businesses, not six months down the line when it reaches another crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bradford is ready to build a City of Culture legacy that will last for decades to come, and I call for the Government to get on board with us too.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>This Saturday, Tameside will join the nation in marking Armed Forces Day. I’m really pleased that, for the first time since 2019, our community will once again be able to gather to celebrate this important occasion.</p>
<p>Our armed forces personnel do so much for us, and it’s vital that we take time to recognise their service – both in the past, and in the present. Both my grandads served in the second world war, one as a navigator in the RAF and the other as a gunner in the Merchant Navy, so like many people in Tameside the military is part of my family history.</p>
<p>Tameside has a proud record of supporting the Armed Forces. In 2012, Tameside council were one of the first local authorities to sign the military covenant – a commitment to ensure that those who are serving or have served in the Armed Forces, and their families, are treated fairly and given the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Tameside’s commitment to the forces is in large part due to the work of the Tameside Armed Services Community. They have been helping Tameside to deliver on the Armed Forces Covenant, and ensuring that Tameside’s Armed Forces community is given the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>From World War II to Afghanistan and Iraq, Tameside’s veterans have put their life on the line for us. Many people in Tameside will remember the tragic loss of Lance Corporal Andrew Breeze, who was killed in 2010 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I was really pleased that in 2016 we were able to commemorate his life by naming a new road in Denton after him. The sacrifice of Andrew, and all other people from Tameside who have given their lives for our country, must never be forgotten.</p>
<p>This year, celebrations will once again be taking place in Victoria Park, Denton. I’m really looking forward to attending this year’s celebrations, and seeing all the activities and entertainment that will be on offer. I’m particularly looking forward to meeting the veterans, reservists and cadets who will be coming along.</p>
<p>In the year of the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Falklands War, in which 225 servicemen died in order to give the Falkland Islanders the democracy and freedom they desired, it’s really important that we don’t forget the sacrifice that members of the Armed Forces continue to make for our country.</p>

<p>It comes as some of the world's poorest countries have been hit by Russia blocking grain exports from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Together, Russia and Ukraine export nearly a third of the world's wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"It is very clear that Mr Putin is indeed using the starvation of the world's poorest people as a tool of war.</em></p>
<p><em>"As we seek to fight back against Putin and use all diplomatic powers, does the minister agree that it would be easier and of course morally right to build a coalition against Putin across the developing world in particular if we restored the cuts to international aid?"</em></p>
<p>Responding, the Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said: "<em>The Right Honourable Gentleman is conflating two fundamentally different issues.</em></p>
<p><em>"The world should be clear that is it Vladmir Putin alone that he is creating these problems with his blockade of grain exports to Ukraine.</em></p>
<p><em>"He could turn the tap of food to the global south on tomorrow and we demand that he does.</em></p>

    <title>Chi backs Mencap ‘Listen To Us’ campaign</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2022/06/chi-backs-mencap-listen-to-us-campaign/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi backs Mencap ‘Listen To Us’ campaign &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Onwurah MP for Newcastle Central is backing ‘Listen To Us’  campaign by the learning disability charity Mencap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Chi attended a Parliamentary event to learn about Mencap’s new report exploring isolation and loneliness which found people with a learning disability described their lives as a “prison,” with limited social contact during the pandemic causing them to feel suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Onwurah said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This week (20-26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June) is Learning Disability Week and I am backing Mencap’s campaign to make sure the everyone understands what life is like for people with a learning disability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Meeting and hearing stories from people with a learning disability and their families about their experiences during the pandemic shows the reality behind the shocking statistics we’ve seen around the impact of loneliness and isolation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She believes the government need to make sure people with a learning disability can get the support they need, like respite care and day services. And ensure sufficient day services are open to provide local activities and social opportunities for people with a learning disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; “I’m supporting Mencap’s ‘Listen To Us’ campaign to ensure we combat loneliness through measures including community services and activities, alongside better support aimed at treating and managing poor mental health for people with a learning disability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“People with a learning disability need to be able to access the support they need and deserve quickly.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; -ENDS-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For further information please contact Mencap’s media team on: &lt;a href="mailto:media@mencap.org.uk%22%20\t%20%22_blank"&gt;media@mencap.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;or 02076965414&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are approximately 1.5 million people with a learning disability in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo attached of Chi with Mencap member and supporters backing the campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a learning disability?    &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A learning disability is a reduced intellectual ability which means that people might need support with everyday tasks – for example shopping and cooking, or travelling to new places – which affects someone for their whole life;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning disability is NOT a mental illness or a learning difficulty, such as dyslexia. Very often the term ‘learning difficulty’ is wrongly used interchangeably with ‘learning disability’;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with a learning disability can take longer to learn new things and may need support to develop new skills, understand difficult information and engage with other people. The level of support someone needs is different with every individual. For example, someone with a severe learning disability might need much more support with daily tasks than someone with a mild learning disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Learning Disability Week 2022 #LDWeek22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning Disability Week is from 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-26th June 2022 and is focused on people’s experiences of living Life with a learning Disability. We know that many people don’t know what a learning disability is, or what life can be like for somebody that has one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we want Learning Disability Week to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate and raise awareness about learning disability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smash stigmas and show the positive element of living life with a learning disability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight and campaign for a fair society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the campaign:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Mencap’s new mental health campaign, ‘Listen To Us’ launched on the 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mencap ran a survey with 580 family members and carers of people with a learning disability in the UK. The survey ran for 3 weeks from 07/02/2022 to 28/02/2022 and was hosted on Alchemer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[i] &lt;em&gt;Survey conducted by Opinion Matters, surveying 2,001 nationally representative UK adults, between 01.10.2021 – 05.10.2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original paper by the Mencap Voices Council which sparked this work can be found here: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mencap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-06/Easy%20read%20Mental%20Health%20Paper%20Final.pdf"&gt;https://www.mencap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-06/Easy%20read%20Mental%20Health%20Paper%20Final.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Karin Smyth MP praises the contributions of UK Armed Forces on Armed Forces Day</title>

<p>To mark Armed Forces Day on Saturday 25 June, Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has praised the contributions of UK Armed Forces in defending communities at home and abroad.</p>
<p>From deployments abroad in response to the invasion of Ukraine to deployments at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, our Armed Forces are essential to our national defence, our national resilience and our national NATO obligations. </p>
<p>The Tory Government has left our Armed Forces with weakened foundations, having cut the Army to its smallest size in 300 years.  In the past 12 months, the Labour Party has called on Ministers to halt army cuts, campaigned for Commonwealth veterans who have served at least four years and their families to have visa fees scrapped, and promoted a new duty of care to allow personnel to receive better legal and welfare support.</p>
<p>Armed Forces Day is held each year on the last Saturday of June to celebrate the service and sacrifice of our UK Armed Forces, veterans and their families. </p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“This Armed Forces Day I want to thank our Armed Forces personnel for their leading role in helping local communities in Bristol South through the Covid-19 pandemic.  34,000 Forces personnel were involved in efforts to tackle the pandemic in the UK, with Armed Forces personnel deployed to hospitals, driving ambulances, and delivering Covid-19 vaccines across the country. </p>
<p>“I am also deeply proud of our servicemen and women’s continued crucial role in defending the UK and our NATO allies from Russian aggression.  Our Armed Forces are essential to our national defence and resilience, but also those of our allies.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government would halt the cuts the current Tory Government are making to our Armed Forces and strengthen support for our veterans, including boosting veterans’ mental health support by £35m.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/06/21/karin-smyth-mp-praises-the-contributions-of-uk-armed-forces-on-armed-forces-day/">Karin Smyth MP praises the contributions of UK Armed Forces on Armed Forces Day</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><strong>Oldham’s three MPs have released the following statement in response to the publication of the Oldham Independent Assurance Review:  </strong></p>
<p>“This is one of the most comprehensive safeguarding reviews undertaken and we welcome the recognition of the progress that was made in Oldham in shining a light on, disrupting and tackling child sexual exploitation and raising awareness to increase reporting.</p>
<p>It is an uncomfortable and disturbing fact that abuse takes place in every city, town and village and Oldham is not immune from that. The vast majority of victims are well supported, and professionals are working hard to meet increasing demand and changes to the nature and pattern of abuse as it develops. However, the report is clear that not all victims received the support they deserve, and one victim let down is one too many.</p>
<p>Our priority has always been supporting the victims, and as MPs we will continue to support victims’ right to justice when the system falls short.</p>
<p>Today’s independent review identifies that, whilst these incidents are not current cases, there is still work to be done in ensuring offenders face the full force of the law and the passage of time should not be a barrier to justice.</p>
<p>This independent review also addressed head on the false and often politically motivated conspiracy theories that claimed grooming gangs were operating under the protection of senior politicians. The review was clear that there is no basis for these accusations, and we are pleased that the report draws a line under this.”</p>

<p>On Thursday, I held one of my regular report back sessions at Grace Church on Dell Road in Stirchley. These sessions are a informal, two-way conversation where I update residents on what I have been up to in Westminster over recent weeks, and then hand the floor over to you, which I find is a great way to discuss a broad range of topics which you find important. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, I kicked off the conversation on the Northern Ireland Protocol, the issues that checks on goods are causing and the need for reasonable talks to resolve concerns. I also spoke about the problem of Exempt Accommodation, updating residents on a Housing Select Committee I had been to in Birmingham earlier that day to hear from those currently living in Exempt Accommodation and the problems they face. I also touched on the Government&#8217;s Rwanda policy and additional&nbsp;issues at the Home Office&nbsp;​including with the&nbsp;Homes for Ukraine Scheme and&nbsp;​backlogs in&nbsp;passport applications, alongside other delays&nbsp;​such as asylum applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I finished on a positive note, as earlier in the week I had hosted the launch of the University of Birmingham&#8217;s local heat solutions report, which is looking at practical ways to diversify homes&nbsp;currently reliant on natural gas at a neighbourhood level, which is overdue and much needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other topics of discussion which came up included: how best to help voters without ID at the next election, proposals to change the pupil funding formula which I had discussed at my recent visit to Bournville Secondary School, how to support businesses on Stirchley high street with inflated rent prices and concerns about inappropriate paving parking and more protected cycle lanes, which I will be writing to Birmingham City Council about to express my concerns. </p>



<p>I keep residents updated on my report back sessions, along with lots of other things via email, and would encourage you to sign up to my mailing list here: to keep up to date.  </p>

    <title>Clean Air Day</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/06/16/clean-air-day/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p class="has-text-align-left">Today marks Clean Air Day. This day seeks to highlight the dangers and impact of air pollution as well as seeking to improve air quality. In Nottingham City we are particularly focussing on idling vehicles, an issue which is easily preventable and which every driver in the city can tackle. </p>



<p>Over 50% of dangerous particulate matter polluting our cities is caused by taxis and cars, idling is especially an issue as it builds up pollution locally. This can be a big problem around schools, where parents dropping off or picking up their children can leave their engines running, causing spikes in particulate matter. This pollution and poor air quality can have huge impacts on our health. it causes 36,000 premature deaths in the UK annually. This can be even more pronounced for children who are still growing. </p>



<p>There are a number of ways air pollution can be reduced, many of these via actions that everyone can take. For example leaving your car at home and using public transport instead or travelling at quieter times to avoid congestion. More details about this can be found online at: <a href="https://www.cleanairhub.org.uk/clean-air-information/what-can-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.cleanairhub.org.uk/clean-air-information/what-can-i-do</a></p>



<p>What is clear is that while air pollution is a global and national issue, the proactive steps taken by the Nottingham Labour led city council has meant that Nottingham has reduced pollution levels while ensuring that its residents can still get around the city easily. </p>



<p>Novel steps such as the Workplace Parking Levy reduces pollution, while our safe school programme seeks to reduce cars idling at school gates, mitigating potential harmful pollution hurting our city’s children </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NCT-bus.png"><img src="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NCT-bus.png" alt="bus showing NCT biogas bus referred to in body of text" class="wp-image-2726" width="240" height="332"/></a><figcaption>NCT biogas bus in the city</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We have maintained majority ownership of NCT, which operates the largest fleet of biogas double decker buses in the country with zero tailgate emissions. Our tram network enables people to move around the city easily powered by clean electricity. We are also focussed on making more homes more energy efficient, as well as championing solar panel technology to reduce the burning of fossil fuels. </p>



<p>Despite all these positive steps, there is still more we can do and Clean air day offers a good time to reflect on that, and for Nottingham Labour to renew and  strengthen its commitment to being as green and forward looking a city as possible. Councillor Sally Longford, portfolio holder for Energy, Environment and Waste said “This Clean Air Day we want to remind people that clean air is everyones responsibility and everyone can make a contribution to a healthier city” </p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-77/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, my week in Westminster began with a <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1530504153381863429?cxt=HHwWioCw2eTauL0qAAAA">meeting with Rahul Gandhi</a>, Leader of the Indian National Congress, hosted by my dear friend Virendra Sharma MP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Then I attended to a Ukraine Briefing hosted by another friend Alex Sobel MP, Labour and Co-operative MP. Welsh Government Counsel General, Mick Antoniw MS for Pontypridd, who has family in Ukraine, joined the meeting online from Cardiff.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Late afternoon I met with the petitioner Anita who created the petition to repeal breed specific legislation. On 6th June I shall be opening the debate on Anita’s petition on behalf of the Petitions Committee. Anita started the petition when her dog Lola was seized under section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, because Lola looked like a pit bull type, despite not being involved in any incidents. Anita’s petition has attracted 114,577 signatures and I look forward to presenting her views to MPs in Westminster Hall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Late Monday evening we voted for our Reasoned Amendment to the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-05-23/debates/73F4EB27-59E6-4CF4-98A5-2CF89A6CA34F/PublicOrderBill">Public Order Bill</a> and lost by 200-292 votes. And we voted against the Second Reading, losing by 202-292 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday morning I chaired the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-05-24/debates/d5475541-9388-48a4-b49b-04b6995bf3ae/OnlineSafetyBill(FirstSitting)">first oral evidence session</a> at the Committee Stage of the Online Safety Bill. The Committee heard from expert witnesses: Kevin Bathurst, Group Director, Broadcasting and Online Content, OFCOM; Richard Wronka, Director of OFCOM’s Online Harms Policy; Dame Rachel de Souza DBE, Children’s Commissioner; Lynn Perry MBE, CEO Barnados; Andy Burrows, Head of Child Safety, NSPCC; Ben Bradley, Government Relations and Public Policy Manager, TikTok; Katy Minshall, Head of Public Policy, Twitter; and Richard Easley, UK Public Policy Manager Meta.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the afternoon, I attended the confidential Petitions Committee planning meeting to consider future debates.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Then I dashed off to join the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1530926940655300609?cxt=HHwWgsCtrZ_8-L4qAAAA">Show Racism the Red Card APPG meeting</a>, which was dedicated to the memory of George Floyd who was murdered on 25th May 2020. We heard from speakers: Baroness Christine Blower; Kevin Courtney; Patrick Cozier, and Katie Daynes about the importance of anti-racism on the National Curriculum in England. And from Dean Pymble, SRtRC Campaign Manager, who outlined the changes to the Curriculum in Wales, and Black History Month. Ged Grebby, CEO of SRtRC, discussed the aims and priorities of the campaign. We met with patrons: former England cricketer, Monty Panesar; Manager of Sheffield Wednesday, Darren Moore; former Arsenal player, Perry Groves; first black player to play for Chelsea, Paul Canoville, and comedian Patrick Monaghan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the afternoon I attended the AGM of the APPG for Cancer and was re-elected as a vice-chair, followed by the APPG for Ukraine and was elected as a vice chair.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Late Tuesday evening we voted against the Second Reading of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, losing by 208-285 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday morning I dropped in at the Melanoma Awareness event hosted by my friend Chris Bryant MP for Rhondda who has, thank goodness, recovered from this cancer. This was followed by an event to view the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1531228935412924416?cxt=HHwWgICy0dOmgsAqAAAA">COVID quilt</a> that Dawn Butler had put together from MPs who had each contributed a segment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Chamber business began with Wales Questions, followed by PMQs, and I wasn’t fortunate to have drawn an oral question for either session. There followed a Report Stage debate on the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill, and a General Debate on Ukraine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We voted for Amendment 14 to the Report Stage of the Bill and lost by 163-280 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As vice-chair of the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoalfieldsRegen/status/1534557620463357953?cxt=HHwWgsCy8c-B7MsqAAAA">UKSPF (UK Shared Prosperity Fund) APPG</a> I attended a meeting to receive an update of the assessment of the UKSPF Prospectus from Professor Steve Fothergill. We are concerned that the financial envelope will only last three years, finishing in March 2025, whereas EU funding lasted for seven, with a possibility of a three year extension. Projects take a long time to set up, and the funding takes a long time to be distributed, so in reality, the project will last until 2024/5. There is a jobs and skills deficit, but people will be reluctant to apply, knowing the shortness of the employment, or will move on as soon as they secure long term employment. This destabilises the sustainability of projects. Minister Neil O’Brien has ensured the APPG that he wants the devolved nations to play a big role in where the money is spent and what it is spent on, and argued that local players should partner with the devolved administrations. But the UKSPF will not be administered by Welsh Government – Local authorities will distribute the fund. Welsh Government Economy Minister Vaughan Gethin MS, has written to the UK Government saying how disappointed he was that they were given only 2 weeks of discussion after trying to engage with the UK Government for several years, and working with Welsh Partners and OECD on how replacement EU funds should be spent in Wales. The UK Government said that Wales will not receive a penny less than what was distributed by EU funding. Mr Gethin says there will be a shortfall in Wales of more than £1.1bn accounting for loss of structural, and rural, funding plus inflation, by March 2025. And the prospectus methodology for financial allocations to Wales distributes money away from those areas where poverty is most concentrated. The officers of our APPG decided to write to Michael Gove seeking clarification of matters arising from the prospectus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended a number of events in Neath over HM Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee weekend, and joined the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Neath Town Council at the Mother’s Union Tea on Thursday afternoon, and the Civic Service in <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1533484843673305088?cxt=HHwWgIC--eWVhMgqAAAA">St David’s Church on Sunday</a>. The service was conducted by the Reverend Canon Lynda Newman, and I sat next to the former Leader of NPT Council Ali Thomas in the service and it was wonderful to be with a dear friend after not seeing him throughout the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday I joined in St David’s Church in <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1533755300444049408?cxt=HHwWgMC49bmU_8gqAAAA">Banwen’s celebration Street Party</a>, sponsored by Onllwyn Community Council and held at Banwen RFC, which was well attended by families from the community. Members of the Church and RFC Committee made a buffet, organised games and decorated the exterior of the clubhouse. Tables were lined up and children enjoyed ice cream while listening to music, a fantastic day was had by all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday I visited Neath <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1531546021259423744?cxt=HHwWgMClpb2_ksEqAAAA">Town Council’s event in Victoria Gardens</a> with Cllrs Sheila Penry, Jan Lockyer, Alan Lockyer, John Warman. Families brought a picnic, had fun on the fairground rides and enjoyed entertainment throughout the day from the “Elderly Brothers”, “Cool Hand Ukes” and “Back Room Bluegrass Band”.  The event was very well attended and the fine weather meant that everyone enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday 6th June as a member of the Petitions Committee I opened the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-06/debates/E7DC68B3-E1E5-449B-B922-F3333187C8FB/Breed-SpecificLegislation">Debate on Repealing breed specific legislation</a> on behalf of the petitioner Anita Mehdi. The Dangerous Dogs Act 1992 allows dogs, who look like 4 breed types, to be seized and Anita had her dog Lola seized under the Act despite not being involved in any incidents. There was cross party support in the debate for the Act to be repealed, but the Minister Jo Churchill declined to give us this assurance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Later Monday evening, there was a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister called by the 1922 Committee (all Tory MPs) which the PM won, but 148 of 359 voted against him. If you take out the Cabinet and Frontbench MPs, 75% of his backbench MPs voted against him.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday morning the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-07/debates/90e5ab5b-a47b-4750-9c47-3f0ac7cd46eb/OnlineSafetyBill(SixthSitting)">Online Harms Bill Committee</a> resumed sitting in public for Line by Line scrutiny. My co-chair Sir Roger Gale chaired this session, which unfortunately was struck by technical difficulties so was only available in audio. I chaired the afternoon session from a different committee room and full coverage was restored. The Bill is very large with many tabled amendments. I also chaired the morning and afternoon sessions on Thursday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday afternoon we held our <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-07/debates/1382840C-48FC-424E-BBB3-E44AD609ACBA/StandardsInPublicLife">Opposition Day debate on Standards in Public Life</a>, and pressed this very important debate to a vote, on which the UK Government decided not to take part in the vote. All the opposition parties voted for the Labour Party Motion calling for strengthening of the standards in public life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday evening I joined Unison’s Year of the Disabled Workers event, and the launch of their Disability Employment Charter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday I took my usual seat on the back row of the Chamber in PMQs to watch the PM after Monday’s vote of confidence. The <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-08/debates/ED695AF0-DE16-47F4-8AD0-8A8149C77BEB/Engagements">first question</a> was asked by former Labour Minister Dame Angela Eagle, and the PM was slightly ruffled to say the least!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After PMQs I attended a series of events and AGMs of APPGs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism, and vice-chair of the APPG Coalfields Communities. I dropped in to the Carers Week event, the Fighting Heart Failure event, and the event calling on the U.K. Government to ratify the Istanbul Convention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-afternoon I attended the Parliamentary Co-operative Party Group for a debrief on the success of our Labour and Co-operative candidates in the local government elections presented by our General Secretary Joe Fortune.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My Thursday was taken up with chairing sessions of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-09/debates/112801bb-af6a-4407-bc06-43d5b913717e/OnlineSafetyBill(SeventhSitting)">Online Safety Bill Committee</a> Line by Line scrutiny and on Friday I campaigned with <a href="https://twitter.com/AberavonLabour/status/1535566316727312384?cxt=HHwWgICx2bzbts8qAAAA">Mark Drakeford in Port Talbot</a> supporting our Labour Candidates Sharon Freeguard and Saifur Rahaman in the Port Talbot Ward NPT Council By-election.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday I chaired the Wales Co-operative Party Council meeting, and in the evening</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/RobHumphreys77/status/1535738191512162306?cxt=HHwWhMCq0fPvhNAqAAAA">celebration of the life</a> of my dear friend Hywel Francis in Onllwyn Welfare Hall. Hywel passed away suddenly on February 14th 2021, and I miss him more every day. Hywel’s son Dafydd and Llafur organised the memorial. We heard tributes from Dafydd and Hywel’s family, Angela John, chair of Llafur, Rob Humphries, local poet Brian Price, and Dai Smith. Hywel had many friends from all over Wales, the U.K. and many parts of the world. Many had made the journey to Onllwyn last Saturday to pay their respects. Hywel was Patron of Onllwyn Male Voice Choir and they sang hymns for Hywel.</p>

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-4/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"&gt;
&lt;div dir="auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing with a further update on a couple of local matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly can I start by thanking everyone who was involved in organising all the Platinum Jubilee Events locally. We had a really wide range of things going on over the weekend, and I know it all took a huge amount of effort. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TFL Clean Air Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who live at the north end of Epsom and Ewell and in Nork are probably particularly aware of the Mayor of London’s plans to extend the Ultra Low Emission zone to the London boundary. This would mean that older vehicles would have to pay a daily charge to drive across the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this has major implications for many people living locally, and while I understand the intent behind the policy, it is in my view damaging and unworkable for the areas immediately adjoining the boundary. Transport for London have yet to give clear details about how it would work on the border – for example what do they plan to do with cases like that of Sparrow Farm Road in Stoneleigh,  which is in Surrey on one side and in London on the other. But it would mean a charge for many Surrey residents doing local journeys or driving from one place in Surrey to another if the route crossed the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lodged an objection to the scheme because of this, and would encourage residents here to make their views known to TfL before the consultation ends. You can do so via this link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/cleanair"&gt;https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/cleanair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do take part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you also to all of those who are helping Ukrainian refugees locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 70 Ukrainian families have arrived in the area and are being hosted by sponsor families.    If you are hosting and need some help, please reach out to Epsom &amp;amp; Ewell Refugee Network who can offer support and advise to you and your guests.   They have a help desk each Monday at the Surrey Stands with Ukraine unit in the Ashley Centre 0930 &amp;#8211; 1430.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Network are holding a free Summer Language School to offer intensive English classes to refugees over the summer holidays.  If you want more information, you can find out more on their website (see link below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/7RVkCRO3xsvG8Al3U934fv?domain=epsomrefugeenetwork.org"&gt;https://epsomrefugeenetwork.org/summer-school-2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a teacher and can offer any help over the summer, please get in touch with them at &lt;a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com"&gt;epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Ukrainians are now finding work and looking to rent a property.   If you are a local landlord and want to find out more about renting your property to a Ukrainian family, please get in touch with Epsom &amp;amp; Ewell Refugee Network to find out more about how all of this works and how your rent is paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Hub in the Ashley Centre continues to collect supplies to send to Ukraine, including tins of food for areas where supplies are short. I know that they would welcome any extra support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Grayling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Hardly surprising after two years of travel restrictions, that this year there would be more people than usual seeking to renew their passports, but the Home Office does not seem to have made any provision.</p>



<p>Passports are now taking more than the stated 10 weeks. I am busy chasing urgent cases via the MP’s hotline, but even that seems overwhelmed, and I would strongly advise, wherever possible, that you ALLOW CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN TEN WEEKS to get a passport application processed. </p>

    <title>Guide to Google Classroom distance learning in 2022</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/guide-to-google-classroom-distance-learning-in-2022/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It’s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it’s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren’t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one’s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn’t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they’re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we’ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don’t have face-to-face access to students. It’s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it’s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let’s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://nigelmillsmp.com/help-with-the-cost-of-living/"><![CDATA[
<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to this special edition of my email newsletter to provide a summary of the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement yesterday to provide support for families in light of the rising cost of living. With the recent news that Ofgem will increase the energy price cap again in October, it was clear that more needs to be done to help households and those struggling so I welcome the support announced yesterday as a positive step. Below you will find an outline of this additional support.</p>



<h2><strong><u>The cost of living crisis</u></strong></h2>



<p>The cost of living crisis that we are experiencing at present is essentially the result of a series of global events which have driven inflation to significantly high levels across the world. These global pressures include the fast reopening of the global economy after the pandemic – with the demand for gas and oil rising so sharply that supplies were not able to keep up, causing skyrocketing gas and oil prices.&nbsp;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further complicated&nbsp;global gas and oil supplies&nbsp;and a fresh wave of lockdowns in China has damaged&nbsp;global supply chains.</p>



<p>The underlying problems that have caused this inflation, and therefore the rise in the cost of living, are so global it is impossible for any government to solve. However, we can help those struggling and build our own economy. The Government is doing this today through a £15 billion&nbsp;package which will support the most vulnerable one-third of households with £1,200 each.</p>



<p>The Government’s additional support can be summed up in the following:</p>



<ul><li>Raising extra revenues through a new Energy Profits Levy, but without deterring investment from energy companies.</li><li>Providing £9 billion targeted support to the most vulnerable households, including pensioners.</li><li>Supporting hard-working families with £6 billion to help with energy bills.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p>The below sections will expand on these elements and give an overview of the support you are going to receive.</p>



<h2><strong><u>Supporting hard-working families with £6 billion&nbsp;to help with energy bills.</u></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>The October £200 energy bills rebate will be doubled to £400</strong>. It will also be turned into a grant, meaning it will not have to be paid back. That’s £400 directly back into the pockets of UK households. This will continue to be delivered by energy suppliers from October, with payments spread over six months.</li></ul>



<h2><strong><u>Providing £9 billion&nbsp;targeted support to the most vulnerable households, including pensioners.</u></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>£650 cost of living payment for every household on means-tested benefits.</strong>&nbsp;This means over 8 million of the most vulnerable households (around one-third of all in the UK) will be directly sent a one-off cash payment of £650, paid out from DWP in two separate instalments, with the first due from July and the second in the Autumn. All those who live in the UK and are in receipt of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Pension Credit are eligible.</li><li><strong>Winter fuel payments will be increased to £300.&nbsp;</strong>A pensioner cost of living payment for every pensioner household in receipt of Winter Fuel Payment. Around 8 million pensioner households already receive Winter Fuel Payments. The Government will send all existing recipients an additional one-off £300 cash payment, due to be paid out automatically in November/December.</li><li><strong>£150 disability cost of living payment for those in receipt of disability benefits</strong>. There will be an additional one-off cash payment worth £150, paid out from DWP in September</li><li><strong>An extra £500m for councils to help those in real need who are not covered by any of the above</strong>. The Government is providing an additional £500 million for the existing Household Fund from October, to ensure local councils can support those not covered by the above set of payments. Local councils will continue to have discretion over exactly how the funding is used.</li></ul>



<h2><strong><u>The new Energy Profits Levy</u></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>The Levy will be in place from today, and will raise around £5 billion over the next twelve months.</strong>&nbsp;The new Levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25 per cent, on top of the existing 40 per cent headline rate of corporation tax. It will be temporary, and as the oil and gas price returns to more historically normal levels, the Levy will be automatically phased out.</li><li><strong>We still need to incentivise energy companies to invest in the UK.&nbsp;</strong>This is to ensure we are more protected from crisis like these in the future. Therefore, a new Investment Allowance will double the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies, so companies will have a significant incentive to reinvest their profits. Modelled on the ‘super-deduction’, for every £1 an oil or gas company invests, they will pay 91 per cent less tax.</li><li><strong>This is very different from the levy proposed by Labour:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike Labour’s windfall tax, this Levy incentivises investment and raises more revenue. The Government’s Levy raises around £5 billion over the next twelve months.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The support announced yesterday is in addition to previous measures, including</span>: </strong></h2>



<ul><li>The non-repayable £150 Council Tax rebate for homes in Council Tax bands A-D;&nbsp;</li><li>The 5p cut on fuel duty for the next 12 months, saving car drivers £100;&nbsp;</li><li>£200 million per year to continue the holiday activities and food programme for disadvantaged children during school holidays;&nbsp;</li><li>Significantly increasing the National Living Wage by 6.6% on the 1st April 2022 to £9.50 per hour for those over the age of 23;&nbsp;</li><li>Increasing the National Insurance personal threshold from £9500 to £12,570 from July.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <title>Barnsley Mayor Making Speech 2022</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>[Check against delivery]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to speak here this evening, on my home turf.</p>
<p>Now, before I begin, I understand there’s a sweepstake on the length of my remarks.</p>
<p>Let me just put everyone’s mind at rest… my money went on 82 minutes – so settle in folks!</p>
<p>Turning to what this evening is all about… Councillor Tattersall – our new Mayor – congratulations!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Mayor, you will be an outstanding Mayor for our borough. You are a tremendous councillor and a force of nature!</p>
<p>I know you have big plans for your term.</p>
<p>Your theme – Educate, inspire and deliver and your charities typify you…</p>
<p>Romero Communities – a wonderful organisation, who have provided invaluable support to countless people in Barnsley.</p>
<p>And one of the friendliest places to get a brew in the borough!</p>
<p>And Hey! – who do so much for our children and young people suffering with their mental health by providing the care they need when they need it most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The very first time I met Sarah was back in 2011. I was dashing about canvassing for Party members’ support ahead of the selection hustings for the forthcoming by-election.</p>
<p>I knocked on her door.</p>
<p>She kindly invited me in.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>I obviously wanted to take Sarah up on her offer – her endorsement would’ve been very useful, but it suddenly dawned on me this encounter was laden with risk.</p>
<p>The dilemma was such: coming in for a chat, meant taking off my shoes which in turn meant – to my great embarrassment – revealing a hole in my sock.</p>
<p>“Shall I take my shoes off” I said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can just leave them at the door” was the reply.</p>
<p>“Oh dear” I thought – it was actually another 4-letter word, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>I saw coming clean as the best course of action…</p>
<p>“I must apologise in advance, but I have a large hole in my sock” I said.</p>
<p>Now, discussing and exposing my ragged clothing – as you can imagine – was not meant to form part of the agenda for this important tête-à-tête.</p>
<p>Sarah’s response however was both merciful and profound…</p>
<p>“People are more interested in what you have to say rather than the state of your socks. And anyway, lots of people round here have holes in their socks”.</p>
<p>She was right. A sage lesson and one worth remembering.</p>
<p>Madam Mayor – I’m very much looking forward to working with you over the next year.</p>
<p>I have every faith you’ll be a huge success and a fantastic champion for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Congratulations again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, before I go any further I’d like to say a few words about the terrible situation in Ukraine because we are joined here tonight against the backdrop of the most appalling violence and misery.</p>
<p>I know we are all greatly inspired by the resolve, determination and spirit shown by the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>The response to the crisis from our community has been incredibly moving – we opened our hearts and our homes.</p>
<p>Naturally I wouldn’t have expected anything less.</p>
<p>We are of course twinned with a proud coalfield community in Ukraine – Horlivka.</p>
<p>A town which is now fighting for its very existence.</p>
<p>A fight it did not start, but from which it will not back down.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago – along with my great colleague and neighbour, Stephanie Peacock – I learned I had been personally sanctioned by the Russian parliament – something I see as a badge of honour because Barnsley stands united against Putin’s illegal invasion and we send our solidarity to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters both here and those resisting his barbaric regime.</p>
<p>Slava Ukraini!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do also want to say a word about the Platinum Jubilee – truly a milestone in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>The Queen – overseeing us this evening – has been the embodiment of service and stability, a constant in our lives and it is right we recognise her unwavering dedication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen… that brings me to another fantastic ambassador, albeit one closer to home – our outgoing Mayor,</p>
<p>Councillor Caroline Makinson.</p>
<p>Caroline… you have been a wonderful advocate for our community and helped see us through the pandemic. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you for all the work you have done – and will continue to do – for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d also like to say something about another outgoing Mayor… me!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the last time I had the honour of speaking at this event was for Councillor Steve Green back in 2018 – which was only a matter days after I had been elected the inaugural Mayor of South Yorkshire, or the Sheffield City Region as it was then.</p>
<p>I’m now back delivering this address but no longer as Mayor.</p>
<p>Let me be candid, many people were surprised at my decision to stand down, but I said from the beginning that being a Mayor and an MP wasn’t a long-term arrangement.</p>
<p>And I meant it.</p>
<p>Some thought that I would step away as MP and keep going with the mayoralty, but I have a fierce loyalty to our town.</p>
<p>You can’t choose where you were born but you can choose where you want to be – and I chose Barnsley.</p>
<p>I hope everyone knows what an enormous privilege it is for me to represent our community, and how seriously I take that responsibility.</p>
<p>Politicians come and go, of course – and if the people of Barnsley want to get rid of me as their MP, then that is their absolute right. But I am not walking away from them.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why… there is so much to celebrate about Barnsley – but above all, it is the enduring spirit of our people that sets us apart.</p>
<p>And why I hold this place so dear, and why I was never going to walk away from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community knows all too well the arc of history does not always necessarily steer to a better tomorrow. But we also know that together we have the power to bend it toward a more hopeful future.</p>
<p>When you walk through our town, you are walking through a chronicle of our past – lessons in who we are, voices reminding us of what we have achieved, inspiration for generations to come.</p>
<p>Just outside, we have our square dedicated to the Barnsley Pals battalions. Men who stepped forward to answer the call during the First World War.</p>
<p>Miners, glassworkers, stonemasons, clerics – many of them friends and neighbours. They joined-up together, trained together, fought together and ultimately, many of them died together.</p>
<p>It is a legacy that inspired some of Barnsley’s finest to serve. Tom Hicks who lived in Royston – a veteran of Arnhem who helped write the Airborne Forces into the annals of history.</p>
<p>And Sergeant Ian McKay, who was born in the borough – another member of that proud brotherhood, posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his sacrifice on Mount Longdon 40 years ago next month.</p>
<p>From the First World War to the Second, to the Falklands and every other conflict beyond, Barnsley’s men and women have consistently stepped forward to answer the call.</p>
<p>Their story reminds us that the lone hero is a myth – we are all in fact, threads, woven together to create something much stronger.</p>
<p>Walk down the Huddersfield Road and you’ll find the head office of the National Union of Mineworkers – a paragon of our community built on coal.</p>
<p>While the Pals’ struggle took them to foreign soil, the miners’ struggle was brought to their very doorstep.</p>
<p>To their detriment, successive governments failed to recognise it wasn’t just coal that came out from the collieries, but community too.</p>
<p>Theirs was a bond forged over generations. Mineworkers and their families wouldn’t run at the first sign of hardship, they held their ground and withstood hunger, smears and violence.</p>
<p>Their fight is a lesson in the meaning of true solidarity.</p>
<p>Down in our town centre, we now have our COVID memorial sculpture – one of the first in the world.</p>
<p>It’s our tribute to those no longer with us, to those who lost loves ones and to those working-class heroes who sacrificed so much to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Barnsley's fierce love <u>will</u> hold you forever in its heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community was left devasted by the pandemic, I know everyone here this evening has their own story – me included.</p>
<p>That suffering will live long in the memory but so too should the resolve of those who pulled us through – our NHS</p>
<p>workers, carers, delivery drivers, shopworkers, posties, transport staff, and many others. Too often taken for granted but</p>
<p>whose true value was there for all to see during our darkest hour.</p>
<p>Men and women from Barnsley have fought, struggled and laboured time and time again for our tomorrow. Their journey is one we continue.</p>
<p>But our story isn’t just one of triumph over adversity. We are so much more.</p>
<p>Barnsley’s sons and daughters have a long and proud history of stepping out and shaping a better world.</p>
<p>Just look at who was awarded the Freedom of the Borough last month alongside our phenomenal <strong>Intensive Care Unit</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Mat Wright – the musical director of the outstanding Barnsley Youth Choir</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Brunt – the world cup winning cricketer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham Ibbeson – the artist and sculptor</strong></p>
<p><strong>And Katherine Kelly – the acclaimed actress.</strong></p>
<p>Inspirational figures, and every one of them Barnsley to their core.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it isn’t just our people that are doing us proud, it’s our place.</p>
<p>Our town centre has undergone remarkable transformation in recent times – praise rightly goes to the Leader of our Council, Sir Steve Houghton and his team for the incredible progress we have seen.</p>
<p>I am however acutely aware not everyone always shares my enthusiasm for when the winds of change begin to blow!</p>
<p>I remember once being in complete awe stood outside our wonderful Town Hall by the newly installed fountains one summer morning – the sun was shining, children were paddling, laughter filled the air. It was a scene of pure joy.</p>
<p>I paused to soak up the experience when a gentleman appeared beside me.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, I could sense he was poised to deliver his judgement.</p>
<p>He then uttered the following – words that will stay with me evermore…</p>
<p>“It used to be a lovely little car park”</p>
<p>I believe Barnsley deserves more former lovely little car parks – we deserve the best because we are capable of the best.</p>
<p>Anyone who questions that ambition has a short memory, look at what we have achieved and how we have achieved it… as one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In every direction, there is much to do. Just as we emerge from a health crisis, we have entered an economic one. Families facing hardship, businesses facing uncertainty.</p>
<p>The challenges we face today and those we face tomorrow are daunting but like the challenges of yesterday, they will be overcome.</p>
<p>You only have to walk around our community and speak to the people who make it so special to know that holds true.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you take comfort in knowing I still have holes in my socks just as I take comfort in knowing our people don’t care, they are still more interested in what you have to say.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your evening. And Madam Mayor, congratulations once again. Thank you.</p></div>

        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Preet Kaur Gill MP joined with pupils at St Paul's School for Girls to take part in online activities with children in Nigeria in the run up to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Preet and the children linked up with Bomas Academy in Jos, Nigeria, and exchanged information about their families, school life and favour subjects. </p>
<p>Steve Frew, who took gold in the 2002 games and 400m champion Lesley Owusu also joined them at the school for a morning of sporting activities. The event was part of Commonwealth Connections - a partnership between the British Council and the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. It involves 60 primary, secondary, and special schools in the West Midlands linking up with 60 schools across 10 Commonwealth countries. Through the partnership, children explore cultures and beliefs and learn how to communicate with people from different backgrounds and perspectives through sports and arts.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said: “Our wonderful city of Birmingham is one of the most diverse in the world and truly reflects the Commonwealth. It’s fantastic to see Commonwealth Connections promoting collaboration and encouraging young people to make new connections with people from different backgrounds and different countries. </p>
<p>“The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 affect us all and it’s vital young people, as future leaders, understand why these are so important. By talking to people across the world with different perspectives of how climate change and sustainability is impacting people’s lives is how we show how global Britain can be a force for good.” </p>
<p>During the event, St Paul’s School for Girls was presented with a British Council foundation level <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/accreditation/international-school-award/about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International School Award</a> by the organisation’s Senior Schools Consultant, John Rolfe MBE. The award champions schools that have shown a commitment to embedding international awareness and understanding in their classrooms and curriculums. The £500k Commonwealth Connections project is co-funded by Birmingham 2022 and the British Council.  </p>
<p>The British Council is delivering the project with Birmingham Education Partnership (BEP) and the children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust (YST). BEP has nominated its flagship Birmingham Arts School to lead on delivery of the arts and culture strand of the project. </p>

    <title>Grant Shapps Welcomes Welwyn Garden City Cross-London Train Route</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><strong>On Monday morning, Local MP Grant Shapps joined passengers at Welwyn Garden City Station to mark the beginning of new cross-London train services between Welwyn Garden City and Sevenoaks, Kent.</strong></p>



<p>The new Thameslink services will run every half an hour during weekday peak times – greatly benefitting those who commute into London from the area.</p>



<p>The link makes up the first-ever direct route across central London via Finsbury Park in the north and Elephant &amp; Castle in the south.</p>



<p>Passengers travelling from Welwyn Hatfield will also benefit from better access to the new Elizabeth Line which opens next week.</p>



<p>During the visit, Mr Shapps met with Tom Moran, Managing Director for Thameslink and Great Northern, as well as various other stakeholders from across the constituency, speaking to them about the new Thameslink service.</p>



<p>Commenting on the service Mr Shapps said, “it’s fantastic to see this new service being introduced, not only for the wider region, but also for my own Welwyn Hatfield constituents who will now be able to travel into London that bit easier.</p>



<p>“Increased connectivity between Welwyn Hatfield, London and Kent can only benefit residents, providing them with greater opportunities, and making the area a more prosperous and desirable place to live.”</p>



<p>When speaking of the service Mr Moran said, “We’re delighted we can now provide these extra seats and new journey opportunities for Hertfordshire and Northeast London commuters. The new route is a key part of the service uplift we’ve achieved for our passengers in the new summer timetable introduced this week.</p>



<p>“This timetable is the starting point for rebuilding our railway, working closely with our community and industry partners to support passengers and the economic recovery of both local and regional rail.”</p>

    <title>ARTICLE: I Won’t Give Up on Unfair Energy Prices</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/article-energy-prices/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=article-energy-prices" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The UK Parliament was prorogued last week, marking the end of this Parliamentary term. As is the way at Westminster, there is a lot of pomp and ceremony attached to the process, but, in short, prorogation allows the Government to reset parliamentary business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Parliament will recommence on the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May, with the Queen&amp;#8217;s Speech marking the beginning of the new legislative session. At this point, we learn the bills the Government intends to pursue over the course of the next session of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Readers may recall that Boris Johnson was found to have illegally prorogued Parliament during the Brexit negotiations. He used this process to avoid scrutiny by MPs of his Government&amp;#8217;s Brexit deal – which resulted in him having to make a formal apology to the Queen. At the time, it was almost unthinkable that any Prime Minister would act to bring their own Government into disrepute. Now we know it was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before the end of Parliament, my Energy Pricing (Off Gas Grid Households) Bill was published. If passed, the bill would oblige the UK Government to act to ensure households do not have to pay more for energy because they do not have access to mains gas supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The current energy price cap is based on the assumption that households across the nations of the UK consume energy with a split of 80% gas and 20% electricity. However, about one in six homes across the nations of the UK are currently off the gas grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The end of the parliamentary session means this bill will fall, along with many others. I will keep on the issue in the new parliamentary session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last week, I also presented Highland News Media&amp;#8217;s petition on unfair electricity charges to 10 Downing Street. It was great to see so much support across the Highlands to end these unfair charges and rest assured, I will continue to work on this issue on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before I sign off, I want to take this opportunity to wish all the candidates standing for  election to the Highland Council well. Whatever separates us in politics, we all want to see the best for our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To everyone else – don&amp;#8217;t forget to vote this Thursday to elect your local Councillors. If you have a postal vote and haven&amp;#8217;t filled it out yet, there is still time, and it can be returned to the polling station on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/article-energy-prices/"&gt;ARTICLE: I Won&amp;#8217;t Give Up on Unfair Energy Prices&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
