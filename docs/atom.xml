<p>Article Originally published on The Telegraph Online (30/06/2021). <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/06/30/brexit-britain-throws-chains-europes-state-aid-regime/" target="_blank">Read it here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><br>New subsidy control bill promises &#8216;agile and flexible&#8217; regime but risks new row with Scottish Government</strong></p>



<p>Britain takes a major step towards throwing off Brussels shackles on state aid today as it unveils a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/05/08/post-brexit-state-aid-regime-set-boost-levelling-up-push/">more flexible subsidy regime</a>&nbsp;in a move likely to reignite an independence row with Holyrood.</p>



<p>The Subsidy Control Bill announced in last month’s Queen’s Speech will be introduced to Parliament, aimed at channeling taxpayer cash towards businesses to meet ambitions on levelling up and net zero goals.</p>



<p>Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/02/03/kwarteng-hails-dynamic-state-aid-system-replace-eu-rules/">the new regime</a>&nbsp;covering loans, grants and guarantees would be more “agile and flexible”, ending the need for lengthy approvals from the European Commission.</p>



<p>But the minister stressed that the new subsidy control regime is a &#8220;reserved matter&#8221; for the UK Parliament, which Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last year called a “blatant move to erode the powers of the Scottish Parliament”.</p>



<p>A Government source said that Ms Sturgeon &#8220;would ultimately start the argument again, that it&#8217;s the people of Scotland, the Scottish Parliament, that should decide whether Scottish local councils or the Scottish Government should be able to award subsidies to different companies&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our argument is you can do that, because this system is way more flexible than the European one. So you either have a British flexible system, which you don’t want, or you want to rejoin the EU.&#8221;</p>



<p>The new regime will give public bodies and devolved administrations far greater autonomy to offer support to businesses, while banning so-called “subsidy races” under which authorities can tempt businesses and jobs away from other areas of the UK.</p>



<p>Ministers have also opted for a light-touch approach on enforcement, with subsidies monitored through a new advisory unit based in the Competition and Markets Authority and disputes settled through the courts.</p>



<p>Mr Kwarteng said: “We want to use our newfound freedoms as an independent, sovereign country to empower public authorities across the UK to deliver financial support &#8211; without facing burdensome red tape.”</p>



<p>Thomas Pope, economist at the Institute for Government, said the regime would be “less restrictive than EU state aid rules”. But he added: “The risk of that approach is that if you&#8217;re leaving enforcement to the courts, there&#8217;ll be more legal uncertainty. And that will mean that some public bodies choose not to offer subsidies because of the legal uncertainty.”</p>



<p>The new regime is likely to trigger increased subsidy spending. According to the IfG,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/case-brexit-state-aid-compromise">the UK spends around £4bn a year on subsidies</a>&nbsp;but far less proportionately than other European Union nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Germany spent three times as much on support as a share of its economy compared to the UK in 2018, while Britain spends a fraction of the EU average on regional development.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>John Penrose MP, who authored a competition report for the Government earlier this year, said: “Ministers are right that taking control of our post-Brexit subsidy regime is a once-in-a-generation chance to create a system that’s more dynamic, nimble and far less bureaucratic than the old Brussels regime. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“But it creates new dangers too, because subsidies are a heady drug that can hook companies and politicians very quickly indeed. If we get them wrong they can featherbed uncompetitive firms and lumber customers with low-quality or overpriced rip-offs.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kwarteng said the new regime would avoid wasting taxpayer money on failing companies.</p>



<p>He said: “We will not return to the failed 1970s approach of the Government trying to run the economy, picking winners or bailing out unsustainable companies. Every subsidy must deliver strong benefits for local communities and ensure good value for money for the British taxpayer.”</p>

    <title>One hundred years of the Chinese communist party – how do you think it has done?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/06/30/one-hundred-years-of-the-chinese-communist-party-how-do-you-think-it-has-done/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>       Tomorrow China will celebrate 100 years from the formation of the Communist party, and reflect a little on its history. I am inviting you to tell me what you think about how this party has governed over the last 72 years of uninterrupted power over the Chinese state. It has been a long time, meaning that modern China is the creature of the work and thoughts of its ruling party.</p>
<p>        The first 30 years of the party were years of struggle, as it recruited mass support, fashioned the Red army, fought a civil war and helped the nation dismiss the Japanese invasion. The era of Mao in government or influencing government from 1949 to 1976 saw the experiment of the Great Leap forward  from 1958-62 as they sought to nationalise everything  and organise work in communes. This led to falls in farm output and many millions dying of famine. This was followed by the Cultural revolution, when young recruits turned against experts and denounced those who did not support the party sufficiently. This too proved disruptive to economic progress. These two movements are now seen as mistakes by many Chinese. </p>
<p>       The 30 years from 1978 saw the Chinese economy make rapid progress from a low base, thanks to the Deng reforms. He decided that China needed small independent farms, small businesses, more competition and some privatisation to inject life and growth. The economy sustained growth of almost 10% per annum. More recently the growth rate has slowed, though the policy is still portrayed as Deng’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics”. There is some ambivalence today about how much further if at all the pro market and free enterprise reforms will be allowed to go.</p>
<p>       China today has a per  capita income and GDP of $10,000. This is one quarter the level of Japan, which decided to rebuild its gravely damaged wartime economy with more of the west’s free enterprise and democratic system. The Chinese level is less than one sixth  of the US, adopting an alternative government and economic strategy. Those who want the state to control more of our lives should pause to ask why so far after 72 years in office Chinese communism has delivered so much less per capita income than the advanced democracies. </p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I suggested that the shop get in contact with EDP 24 and you can read the article here: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/wymondham-rspca-charity-shop-attacked-by-slamming-scammer-8080976?fbclid=IwAR16rxoRMZEAJbi01P_6ADN9WHcdvEEelhkKVLrLerQWRU9IPjrl_F9au2Y"&gt;https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/wymondham-rspca-charity-shop-attacked-by-slamming-scammer-8080976?fbclid=IwAR16rxoRMZEAJbi01P_6ADN9WHcdvEEelhkKVLrLerQWRU9IPjrl_F9au2Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have also suggested that they get in contact with Trading Standards, and I will also be writing to the relevant Minister on their behalf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have included a link here with advice from BT on 'Slamming' and how this can be avoided: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bt.com/help/landline/what-is--slamming--"&gt;https://www.bt.com/help/landline/what-is--slamming--&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Inverness Courier recently reported on a fantastic initiative by the Culloden Community council, supported by Incredible Edible Inverness and the Highland council, to plant fruit trees. They intend to add to the community’s attractiveness, encouraging pollination and, hopefully, growing fruit for locals to pick. It is a simple idea but a very good one and builds on the fantastic work already underway by Incredible Edible Inverness.</p>
<p>The group’s volunteers have been turning previously unused corners of our city into vegetable and herb plots. We should all get behind their efforts, not only in support but in funding, to ensure they continue to deliver long term benefits for our communities at what will be relatively low costs.</p>
<p>As we look to our post-pandemic future, it would benefit the well-being of the city and its impact on the wider Highlands for us to collect examples of such good practice. These ideas and the work of groups across our communities, both small and ambitious, will enable us to develop a set of strategies for our city.</p>
<p>Too often, these projects are easy to miss unless it is a significant, newsworthy development like the conversion of the Castle to an attraction that locals and visitors can access.</p>
<p>I am always in awe of the depth of talent and commitment we have in our communities, and we need to find a way of bringing talent and projects together under a shared vision for Inverness.</p>
<p>As we seek to rebuild and grow our local economy again, our thoughts need to be on what we want our city to be 20 or 30 years from now – if not, we will keep making the mistakes of the past, aiming for short term wins and looking back at missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Just as Incredible Edible Inverness and Culloden community council looked around, noted the strengths of the natural environment and set out to build on it, we need to do the same and put well being at the heart of our city’s future, designing a great place for families.</p>
<p>As your MP, my mission is to work with you all to do just this. Creating the city we want needs more than the Council; it requires all agencies, business and people. It needs us all to work together.</p>

    <title>Philip Dunne raises concerns about eavesdropping on Ministers without their knowledge</title>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the Government statement on security arrangements relating to ministerial offices and communications Philip Dunne raises concerns about sensors being used to eavesdrop on Ministers, and others who work in Government buildings, without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="overlay"&gt;
                &lt;div class="paragraph-image-wrapper" style="background-image: url()"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption"&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=1542"&gt;Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like my good and hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Steve Brine), I joined the Department of Health in moving into this new building, 39 Victoria Street, at the end of 2017. Will the Minister ask the Department to consider in its internal investigation whether the devices were installed as part of the new build or subsequently? Will she also please develop a protocol from the Cabinet Office across Government that all Ministers, and frankly all people working in Government buildings, are notified of any official listening, visual or other sensors in their place of work, so that they are aware of it rather than, as we have been today, surprised by it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=4647"&gt;Julia Lopez (The Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are very pertinent questions, and ones that I have asked in advance of today and to which we will all want answers. My right hon. Friend makes an important and useful suggestion when it comes to the protocol in relation to CCTV or any other device that might be found in a Minister’s office. I am sure that other Ministers across Government will want that assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-06-28/debates/7ac646ea-f041-4df7-a179-514e8f85fb8d/CommonsChamber#contribution-DCEBF842-23CE-4884-B8D8-6A29FB9C417B"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p class="gmail-m6594299609016945220xmsonormal">“The resignation of the Health Secretary is not the end of the matter. Serious questions remain on contracts awarded by the minister, the use of private personal emails to discuss government business, and how much other Cabinet members knew about the Health Secretary’s actions.</p>
<p class="gmail-m6594299609016945220xmsonormal">“As a former NHS employee, and current member of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, I have serious concerns with the reckless way in which the Prime Minister and Mr Hancock have upheld standards in public life. Our NHS employees hold themselves to the highest standards imaginable and this current government continues to ignore the Nolan principles of public life.</p>
<p class="gmail-m6594299609016945220xmsonormal">“Behaviour in government comes from the top and all we have seen from the Prime Minister is someone who doesn’t believe the rules apply to him, whilst we all do our bit and follow them to the letter.</p>
<p class="gmail-m6594299609016945220xmsonormal">“I hope the new Health Secretary takes the time to review the Health Bill, particularly the lack of <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black;">accountability to local people for changes to how services are managed locally. All his focus must be on taking immediate action to start clearing waiting list backlogs and improving access to local GPs. Not to mention securing support in the community to stop health problems getting worse.”</span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/28/karin-smyth-mp-responds-to-health-secretary-resignation/">Karin Smyth MP responds to Health Secretary resignation</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>Black Country Core Strategy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/black-country-core-strategy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>At the end of last week the Black Country Core Strategy was published. <strong>The proposed plan has left me shocked at the sheer scale of development being proposed for my constituency. </strong></p>
<p>At its heart the proposal <u>should</u> have been looking at viable opportunities to provide housing and employment across our communities on appropriate local sites.</p>
<p>Instead, the proposal simply seeks to drive a coach and horses through the green lungs of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>
<p><strong>The proposed development on our precious Green Belt is unacceptable to me and I know from the many emails that I have already received on this matter that it is unacceptable to you too.</strong></p>
<p>I am still of the firm belief that there are an adequate number of brownfield sites across the Black Country which should be developed first instead of forging ahead with the wholesale destruction of our  Green Belt and Open Spaces.</p>
<p>That’s why I will be questioning the housing allocation numbers and asking why it is that my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and the wider Walsall area are being expected to do the heavy lifting and why we are being asked to take a disproportionate number of houses.</p>
<p>Whilst at this stage the Black Country Plan is only a ‘proposal, it remains extremely important that when the consultation starts in August we all feed in our views.</p>
<p>When I have further information about the consultation I will update you all.</p>
<p>However, please be assured that I will be opposing this plan on behalf of the residents of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">In the recent Queen’s Speech, the Government formally announced their plans to introduce mandatory Voter ID at the next election. This policy requires voters to present photo ID to vote at polling stations in future elections.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Since this policy was first announced in December 2016, the Government has received multiple warnings from charities, civil society figures and campaign groups that mandatory voter ID – if rolled out nationally - could pull up the drawbridge for millions of voters.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> <em>“Millions of people lack photo ID in this country - in particular the elderly, low income and Black, Asian and ethnic minority voters. The Conservatives are reversing decades of democratic progress and urgently need to rethink this pointless policy. In the coming weeks I will be carrying out a survey to find out what my constituents think about these plans. The reality is that the Tories are attempting to price people out of democracy and it is a disgrace.”</em></p>

    <title>Gwynne supports new Royal Mail postal apprenticeship scheme</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233762" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/royal-mail-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/royal-mail-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/royal-mail-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/royal-mail-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/royal-mail-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/royal-mail.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is backing the new Royal Mail postal apprenticeship scheme which launches today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new scheme is designed to provide applicants with the required skills for a successful career at Royal Mail. Areas such as customer services, industry knowledge, and lessons in financial budgeting and health and wellbeing will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme represents one of the UK&amp;#8217;s largest intakes of apprenticeships, and will aim to offer up to 1,000 Level 2 Apprenticeships which will be based at delivery offices across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many senior Royal Mail employees &amp;#8211; including Ricky MacAulay, Operations Development Director and Executive Board Member – began their careers through the former Postal Cadet Scheme which ceased in 1996. All applicants who successfully complete the scheme will be offered a permanent role&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme opens for applications on Monday 28 June and the initial cohort of 500 apprenticeships will begin in September 2021. Royal Mail will make a further announcement in relation to the remaining 500 apprenticeships at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting on the new scheme, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic initiative by the Royal Mail, and I would encourage anyone in my constituency who is interested in a career with the Royal Mail to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships are the key to unlocking the potential of individuals up and down the country, and offering these kind of schemes is key to rebuilding after the effect that the pandemic has had on jobs and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;m so pleaded that Royal Mail are offering this scheme, and I hope we see many more from other employers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>An important milestone in Bishop Burton College’s development was marked last week by the launch of its new Centre for Precision Agriculture, which was officially opened by Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness.</p>
<p>£1.7m has been invested by the Department of Education for the college’s new facilities and equipment, to educate the farmers and agriculturalists of the future in new ways to deliver both environmental and economic sustainability.</p>
<p>The centre is part of the Yorkshire and Humber Institute of Technology, an employer-led collaboration between the county’s further education colleges and the University of Hull and University of York St John, which is designed to provide higher level technical and digital skills across the region.</p>
<p>At the launch guests had the chance to observe some of the specialist equipment that has been obtained for the centre, in action. This includes GPS field mapping and guidance systems, thermal drone technology, a seed drill and fertiliser spreader fitted with variable application technology and ISOBUS control systems.</p>
<p>The opening was followed by the college’s 60th annual Stockmanship competition, where students demonstrated their ability to prepare and present livestock for the show ring.</p>

<p>Graham said, “I was absolutely delighted to be invited to open Bishop Burton College’s new Institute of Technology. The event was fantastic, and I was honoured to be able to play such a big role at the official launch.</p>
<p>“In order to compete across the world, we need the best teaching facilities to provide the highest quality professionals in the field.</p>
<p>“This investment by the college and the Government shows us coming together to support that aim.”</p>
<p>Bill Meredith, Principal and Chief Executive of the college, said, “UK Agriculture is undergoing a period of rapid change and the college’s new Precision Agriculture Centre will play an important role in providing the higher level skills training needed to improve productivity whilst at the same time meeting environmental expectations.</p>
<p>“As a partner in the Yorkshire and Humber Institute of Technology, the college is working with employers to harness the power of digital technologies to improve efficiency and reduce the industry’s carbon footprint.”</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-57/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Monday afternoon, I joined a briefing for Labour MPs hosted by Kevin Brennan MP, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party Northern Ireland Backbench Group. We heard from Louise Haigh, Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on the political situation in Northern Ireland, the stability of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Northern Ireland Protocol, the up and coming legacy legislation and an update on the broader political situation in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The past 8 weeks have rocked the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson being elected unopposed as its third leader since Easter, following Arlene Foster and Edwin Poots being removed as DUP Leaders. Sir Jeffrey will have to resign his seat in Westminster and join the Northern Ireland Assembly and take over as Leader. Sir Jeffrey said when he was running for Leader that he will “vigorously oppose the protocol in principle and in practice”, but the EU will not agree to abolishing the protocol and the majority of Northern Ireland voters want the UK to agree to regulatory alignment with the EU. When he was elected he called on the UK and EU to “step up and recognise the flaws of the protocol” which may be the start of a more realistic, but challenging effort to steer unionist opinion away from insistence on the protocol’s removal. But it would be difficult to shift unionist opinion and Boris Johnson vacillates between indifference and insulting the EU, for example “the sausage war”, but in Northern Ireland exports to the Irish Republic are unaffected. This must be seen at a time when the DUP are at its lowest ever rating in opinion polls with 16%. Labour is calling for stability and a proper set of negotiations.</p>
<p>On Monday evening I spoke in the Opposition Day Debate on Protecting Britain’s Steel Industry. I supported our motion to bring forward emergency legislation to give Ministers powers to reject the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) recommendations, temporarily extend all 19 steel safeguards so they do not expire at the end of June, and allow time to find a long-term solution to protect the British Steel Industry. Under current legislation, the Secretary of State can accept the TRA’s recommendations to scrap 9 of the 19 safeguards, or reject them and we will lose all 19 when they are due to expire on 30th June. Dropping 9 of the 19 safeguards will open up the UK market to thousands of tonnes of cheap steel imports with no defences to stop it, and have dire consequences for every steelworks in the UK because of the interconnectedness of the steel industry. The British Steel Industry produces 7 million tonnes of crude steel every year, which is 70% of the UK’s annual requirement, of which 90% is recycled over and over again. The TRA’s recommendations puts 33,700 well-paid, average salary £34,299, highly-skilled jobs at risk, many concentrated in South Wales. The UK Tory Government voted against our motion, but I shall continue to fight for steelworkers in Neath and in the UK, and push for better protections for our steel industry.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning I joined the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Parkinson’s chaired by my dear friend Baroness Anita Gale of Blaenrhondda. The meeting discussed accelerating Parkinson’s research, and we heard from Professor David Dexter, Associate Director of Research at Parkinson’s UK and Tim King, who has lived with Parkinson’s for over 8 years. David said that during the first Covid wave 90% of Parkinson’s research projects were stopped, and 100% of clinical trials were stopped. There has been £270 million reduction in charity funded medical research. Parkinson’s sufferers have had limited access to Parkinson’s nurses and neurologists. And no access to branch meetings, exercise classes, support services, which has worsened symptoms, impacted on mental health, and caused a huge increase in demand for Parkinson’s UK helpline services. But Covid trials, drugs and vaccines were set up in days, not months, without compromising patient safety, and similar innovation could dramatically speed up Parkinson’s research. Parkinson’s is the fastest growing neurodegenerative condition. We need to apply the lessons from Covid, seek UK Government funds for research and find a cure. We are striving to predict onset, and need early detection and better diagnosis. Tim spoke passionately about living with Parkinson’s during Covid, the regression and the social isolation, but said that he was better off than most because he is not a needy person and has access to a garden. Tim has recently set up an online appointment with his speech therapist. He said that the link between Covid and mental illness is real, and he is very worried about future social care costs as his symptoms worsen. Baroness Anita Gale said that the Legacy Benefits case has been listed to be heard in the High Court in the summer, and our Judicial Review appeal for continuing healthcare is listed for next Wednesday. The Health and Social Care Bill has not been published yet, but that we shall be working on amendments to strengthen the Bill, if Parkinson’s is not covered adequately in the text of the Bill. And I shall be meeting members of the Parkinson’s UK All-Wales Research Interest Group in the near future.</p>
<p>Tuesday lunchtime, as vice-chair of the APPG for Boxing, I joined an officers’ meeting to discuss the forward work plan for the next twelve months. We discussed the possibility of inviting representatives from either side of the debate on White Collar Boxing to address the APPG so that we can further understand aspects of this vastly growing element of boxing and the call for its regulation.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening I attended two consecutive APPGs specifically on matters in Wales.</p>
<p>The first was the APPG Rail in Wales AGM and I was honoured to be re-elected as a vice-chair. My friend and colleague Chris Elmore MP was re-elected as chair. We received a presentation from CAF UK and Ireland Business Directors, Kate Austen and Richard Garner. CAF is a multinational group with over 100 years of experience in supplying comprehensive transit solutions at the forefront of technology. CAF provides a flexible array of products in railway-related markets, including, rolling stock, components, infrastructure, signalling and services, towards a single, global, specific solution. CAF announced a rolling stock factory at Celtic Business Park in 2016, and was producing rolling stock by 2018. CAF has produced high speed trains, light rail, locomotives and trams for transport throughout the UK. CAF is also producing long-life train batteries for trains and buses, and hydrogen buses in its Poland factory. CAF will be supplying the next batch of trains for Transport For Wales which will have WiFi, air conditioning, with bicycle storage and wheelchair access. These will be built in Newport and the members of the APPG will be visiting the factory in the near future. The second was the APPG Wales in the World, of which I’m a vice-chair, where we heard from Fiona Stewart the owner and Manager Director of the Green Man Festival about the difficulties of preparing to hold a music festival during the pandemic. Green Man is one of the five large independent festivals left in the UK the remainder are run by ticketing companies. Green Man is run as a business and not funded by Welsh Government, nor Arts Council Funding. Fiona has fought off take-overs from multinational companies. It is located in Glanusk, and even though the backdrop is beautiful, the rental costs have risen considerably every year and are unaffordable, so Fiona is looking for a permanent site within Wales. Fiona uses local materials to build the Green Man and on-site stalls source local food produce. Fiona attracts the acts herself and brings new groups to the stage every year. She said that the festival is covered extensively by UK media – Guardian, Telegraph, New Musical Express, Independent, Brooklyn Vegan – but receive little exposure from Welsh media. The 25,000 tickets for this year’s four day festival from the 19<sup>th</sup> to the 22<sup>nd</sup>August sold out in 18 minutes, but Fiona doesn’t know whether it will go ahead due to increasing concerns about the new Delta variant in Wales. And the UK Government hasn’t provided insurance cover for cancel of festivals, so the organiser takes the risk and bears all the costs. Hopefully, one day I’ll visit the Green Man festival, perhaps when it celebrates its 20th Anniversary in 2022.</p>
<p>On Thursday I chaired Westminster Hall, as part of my duties as a member of the Panel of Chairs. The Chair of the Select Committee for Education, Robert Halfon, presented a statement on the First Report of the Education Committee, The forgotten: how White working-class pupils have been let down, and how to change it, HC 85. And took questions from MPs. Mr Halfon stated that his committee is dedicated to championing left behind groups and decided to examine decades of neglect of disadvantaged white pupils who underachieve in education. That his committee understands the justified anger people feel about racism, prejudice and discrimination, but the picture for white British children eligible for free school meals is particularly bleak. And that the UK Government’s Department of Education approach is not working and it needs a targeted approach including: tailor-made funding and support at local level to level-up educational opportunity; disadvantaged white families must have access to strong early years support and family hubs for parental engagement to tackle multigenerational disadvantage; ensure the value of vocational training and apprenticeship options whilst boosting access to higher education; all students must have access to the best teachers; stop pitting one group against another and find a better, less divisive way to talk about racial disparities in the UK. Mr Halfon took questions from MPs, some of whom were members of the committee who praised the report. Those MPs who were not, scrutinised the findings. In particular, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP stated that the committee’s finding that the use of terms such as “white privilege” contributed to neglect of white working class pupils was utter nonsense. It is not based on the colour of their skin, it is the continual cuts and lack of UK Government funding leave all kids from poor backgrounds perennially pushed out. Mr Halfon completely disagreed and stated that the use of terminology such as “white privilege” is wrong for three reasons: it applies a collective guilt when individuals should be responsible for acts of racism; it portrays white working class disadvantaged communities as white privileged; it is factually incorrect as those from almost every other ethnic group on free school meals do much better than their white working class counterparts.</p>
<p>The next debate was secured by Dr Lisa Cameron and was titled “That this House has considered the role of the community in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak.” Dr Cameron called for the debate to give members a chance to formally recognise the unprecedented and undoubtedly life saving support that local community groups and their members have provided to those most vulnerable and in need during the Covid-19 pandemic. They are the unsung heroes of the pandemic and their dedication and sacrifice exemplified by the late Captain Sir Tom Moore and his fundraising efforts are an absolute inspiration to us all. If anything positive can be taken from this pandemic it is that it has shone a light on the strength of community spirit that has emerged through local groups and individuals who have delivered support to those most in need. Dr Cameron commended the work of many support networks, local schools, local council teams in her constituency, and concluded by mentioning that the Thank You Day celebrations are due to take place on Sunday 4th July and this year, teamed up with Keep Britain Tidy, have organised community litter picks across the UK. Many MPs spoke in the debate and thanked Dr Cameron for the opportunity to speak about the wonderful work of community groups and individuals in their constituencies. The Opposition Spokesperson Naz Shah spoke about people from every community, those of faith and no faith, from all four nations of the UK, stood up to play their part and support our nation in our time of need, with their kindness and generosity. She said that we saw British Spirit in this pandemic, whether it is the Muslim doctors who sadly were the first to die on the frontline, or the Sikh volunteers delivering langar; the black train driver in London, or the white taxi driver in Devon; the church providing PPE or the synagogue setting up a vaccine centre; the European supermarket worker or the refugee delivery driver; the doctor, the nurse, the care worker or the cleaner. Modern Britain is diverse, inclusive, all playing our part to protect our country, our NHS and our people. The Minister for Regional Growth and Local Government, Luke Hall said that the debate has given members a chance to tell inspirational stories about their community champions. And to thank communities, organisations, volunteers and individuals for what they have done over the past 18 months and Mr Hall promoted the Prime Minister’s Points of Light awards which recognise all the work done by those at the forefront of the pandemic. And he agreed with Dr Cameron that when we start to build back better we will be holding the sacrifice of others at the forefront of our minds.</p>
<p>This week we heard an updated statement from the Ministry of Justice on the rape review, after reports that rape convictions and prosecutions are at a record-low following a decade of Conservative incompetence and cuts. The UK Government recently outlined its intentions to reinstate the number of rapists being brought to court and prosecuted to at least 2016 levels, but following calls from Labour for these targets to be met within a year, the Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, has now branded such targets as “constitutionally illiterate”.  This is an insult to rape victims across the country who are struggling for justice.  The UK Government must stop shifting the blame and avoiding responsibility, and actually commit to much needed actions and investment.</p>
<p>On Saturday we marked Armed Forces Day.  The pandemic has shown just how important our servicemen and women are in keeping the country going in times of crisis, with the forces playing varied roles throughout.  From helping to build the Nightingale hospitals, to medics and dentists contributing to the testing and vaccination programme and lending their expertise in leading a crisis, we can be proud of the contributions of our Forces in Britain.  Overseas our Forces work hard to protect vital shipping lanes from piracy, promote humanitarian work and provide essential support during hurricane season in the Caribbean.  Saturday was an opportunity to remind ourselves of all the essential contributions the Forces make and to express our sincere thanks.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any issues that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <title>Celebrating 100 years of the Tyne Bridge</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/06/celebrating-100-years-of-the-tyne-bridge/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;Chi Onwurah &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;(Newcastle upon Tyne Central) (Lab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I beg to move,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this House has considered celebrating 100 years of the Tyne Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Roger, and to share with you and the Minister the details of the celebration of our fantastic Tyne bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often say of people that they need no introduction, and that is certainly true of the Tyne bridge. It is a great icon of the north-east, of our pride, our people, our culture and our engineering. It is one of the greatest bridges of the world and, in my humble opinion, the most beautiful bridge ever built—or it is when it is looking its best, which is not now. The Tyne bridge is a nonagenarian. It will be 100 years old in 2028. We want to celebrate it and the purpose of this debate is to find out from the Minister what he plans to bring to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I will give a little bit of history. The roots of our Tyne bridge go back millennia. The first recorded bridge across the Tyne, near to the location of the current bridge, was the Roman pons aelius, which was built in about 122 AD. The Romans believed that all rivers had a god who blessed the community living by the water, and representations of the Tyne’s river god can be found across Tyneside to this day. In 1270, a medieval stone bridge was built, which stood for 500 years until it was badly damaged by the great flood of 1771 and replaced by a new stone bridge in 1781. That replacement was itself removed in 1866 to allow the taller ships that existed by then to pass up the Tyne, with the swing bridge being built in 1876 by the “Magician of the North”, William Armstrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 1925, construction of the current Tyne bridge began. High enough for ships to pass underneath, it was built for the new age of the motorised vehicle and to cope with the increased volume of traffic across the Tyne. Made of steel and granite, the bridge was a major feat of engineering. It was constructed using shipbuilding techniques by local shipyard workers—hence the steel rivets, which can still be seen today. When it was opened in August 1928, it was the world’s longest span bridge. I recommend that everyone sees the fantastic photographs of its construction, which can be found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tyne bridge is sometimes cited as a prototype for the Sydney Harbour bridge. In fact, although the Sydney Harbour bridge was not completed until four years after the Tyne bridge opened, work began on Sydney’s bridge first. Although the two bridges had the same design team, the differences between them are really quite striking, as was explained to me by Vin Riley, a local engineer and historian. The Sydney Harbour bridge is 1,149 metres in length and 48 metres wide, which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;makes it almost exactly three times the size of the Tyne bridge, which is 389 metres long and 17 metres wide. But what the Tyne bridge may lack in size, it more than makes up for in beauty, being more perfectly proportioned than Sydney Harbour bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sydney Harbour bridge is simply flatter, as its nickname of “the Coathanger” implies. That makes for a gentler, less hair-raising experience for those who have walked the bridge arch—I have not done so, but I understand that it is very popular—but it also makes the bridge less inspiring. The arch of the Sydney Harbour bridge is thicker at its base than at its height. The Tyne bridge, on the other hand, is thinner at its earth-bound side and much broader at the height of the arch, which gives the impression that it is bounding up, soaring away, almost as if it were trying to shake itself free of its earthly constraints. What more apt symbol could there be of the people of the north-east, who have so often shown through generosity and social activism, through passion and protest, through hope and hard work, a desire to put an end to earthly pain and a determination to build a better, brighter and more just world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not the only way in which the Tyne bridge represents our whole region. It connects the north and south of the Tyne and spans the region in its construction. It was built by Dorman Long, which went on to become British Steel and was based in Middlesbrough on the Tees. Building the Tyne bridge was a mammoth task, and workmen risked their lives working up to 200 feet above the river without the benefit of safety harnesses, helmets and ropes. One worker died—Nathaniel Collins, a 33-year-old scaffolder from South Shields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge was officially opened on 10 October 1928 by King George V. The King and Queen were the first to cross it in their State Landau horse-drawn carriage, as thousands of people lined the streets for the opening ceremony and 20,000 local schoolchildren were given the day off to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly fitting that we are celebrating the bridge today, as it is International Women in Engineering Day. The Dorman Long design team included the first woman to gain entry to the Institution of Civil Engineers, Dorothy Buchanan. As a chartered engineer myself—though an electrical engineer, not a civil engineer—I want to pay particular tribute to her on this day. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt that I represented all the women in the world. It was my hope that I would be followed by many others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our hope, too. In 2018, more than 90 female engineers from across the country gathered in Newcastle to celebrate the bridge’s 90th birthday and Dorothy Buchanan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Tyne bridge is an important part of our north-east transport infrastructure and is used by more than 70,000 vehicles every day. It was upgraded to grade II* listed status in August 2018 as part of the Great Exhibition of the North, meaning that it is a particularly important structure of more than special interest. It is also home to the furthest inland breeding kittiwake colony in the world. Any work on the bridge must be planned around their breeding season on the towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beautiful granite towers, which stand at each edge of the bridge, used to be open to the public, but in recent years have been used only for the odd illegal rave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a huge pity that there is no longer a legal way for north-east communities to use that space. It has magnificent views across the Tyne, from the north and the south, and would be a superb exhibition space, restaurant or other community space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bridge as a whole is not looking its best—far from it. I am regularly contacted by constituents and visitors to our city upset at the state into which it has been allowed to fall. A bridge of that stature and importance requires regular safety checks, repairs, preservation and upkeep. The Tyne bridge was last fully painted in 2000, and the paint system is designed to last approximately 18 to 20 years, so a new paint job is overdue. Repairs are needed to the road deck, the towers, the stonework and the steelwork, and a new drainage system needs to be installed. A major refurbishment takes time—some years—in addition to the tendering process, which may also take over a year. If the bridge is to be ready for its birthday, we need to start planning it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to celebrate the Tyne bridge in 2028, and celebrate our region. Just last week, Members of Parliament from across the north-east—many Members wished to contribute to this debate but were unable to be here—together with local authority leaders, the North of Tyne Mayor Jamie Driscoll and the police and crime commissioner Kim McGuinness, wrote to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Transport Secretary to request the £18.5 million needed to repaint the bridge from the levelling up fund. We want to ensure that it looks at its best, as a symbol of our region’s proud engineering past and, we hope, prosperous future. We want to make it fit for a queen—the Queen, in fact. We very much hope that the Queen will consider commemorating the bridge her grandfather opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot allow the bridge to continue in its current state of disrepair. It represents our region nationally and globally. It is the familiar backdrop to the annual great north run, as 54,000 runners pass over the bridge, accompanied by a display from the Red Arrows. The bridge is also used for other large events, including hosting the rings for the 2012 Olympics, the 2015 rugby world cup, and, more recently, the 2019 European rugby champions cup final. It was the location for the amazing closing ceremony of Freedom City 2017, when we celebrated 50 years since Martin Luther King’s visit to our city, and also the closing ceremony of the Great Exhibition of the North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the sad fact is that the bridge’s last proper birthday celebrations were for its 75th birthday, hosted by local mayors from Gateshead and Newcastle. The Sydney Harbour bridge, on the other hand, is celebrated annually as the backdrop for the first fireworks display of each new year and had a large, organised 80th birthday celebration, with a special performance by musicians on the top of its 134 metre-high arch. The Tyne bridge, I am afraid to say, had nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government make much of their levelling-up agenda, yet the north seems to be forgotten when it comes to celebrating our communities. I have raised with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Department for International Trade that they only seem to use London images—red buses and Big Ben—to promote the United Kingdom abroad. Why not the Tyne bridge and the Angel of the North?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Britain must mean global Britain including the north-east. If this refurbishment does not happen and the bridge is allowed to continue in its current state of disrepair and neglect, I am afraid to say that it will become a different kind of symbol of the north-east. It will become a symbol of the neglect of the north-east, which has been forgotten by this Government—its great heritage and great future have been forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What support does the Minister propose to offer my region for this momentous celebration? I do not suppose that the Minister can tell us the Communities Secretary’s response to our levelling-up fund application—although I would be very much pleased if he gave a certain yes—but does he agree that celebrations of such a national icon cannot be left simply to the local authority funds? Does he recognise that 10 years of austerity have slashed local government spending? For example, Newcastle City Council has lost more than a third of its spending power since 2010, with city spending entirely taken up by statutory duties such as social care. Does the Minister agree that local authorities cannot be expected to fund such a major project? Would he expect Westminster City Council to pay for the refurbishment of the Big Ben, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will the Minister ensure that all the north-east’s communities benefit from the celebrations? How will he work with other Departments to ensure that great engineering stories, such as those of Dorman Long and—this is particularly relevant on International Women in Engineering Day—of Dorothy Buchanan, are celebrated as part of the festivities? We want to inspire another generation of engineers, particularly women engineers, with our celebrations. Will the Minister talk to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure support for protecting our kittiwakes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the north-east, we know how to give a party. The north-east will bring our bridge, our passion and our people to the party. What will the Minister bring?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preet puts exempt sector on notice </title>

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP has written to the 40 providers of exempt accommodation across the constituency of Edgbaston in Birmingham, putting those that offer substandard housing on notice. </p>
<p>Across Edgbaston alone, 40 providers run more than 280 properties supporting some of Birmingham’s most vulnerable residents. However, in the last three years provision of this type of housing has more than doubled, with the number of claimants increasing from 11,000 in 2018 to 22,500 today.  </p>
<p>In her letter to these providers, Gill writes that while exempt accommodation is a much-needed source of housing, with the quantity of provision exploding “my worry is that the standard of accommodation and support is not at the level which it needs to be.” While Birmingham needs this type of supported accommodation, if the property is not well-managed, it often attracts anti-social behaviour and crime which has a big impact on the local community. Drug dealing, theft and prostitution have all been seen to have begun in places where it had not been previously. </p>
<p>She goes on to say, “I have received hundreds of enquiries and complaints from those impacted by exempt providers who are not supplying suitable provision. One such instance was that of Saif Lodge. The property has been causing many issues in the area and has been taking up the already limited resources of public services. In this case, sufficient evidence was collated, and the court imposed an eight-week closure notice on the property.” </p>
<p>It is for this reason why Ms Gill has written to providers, urging them to sign up and comply with Birmingham’s new Quality Standard. The Standard aims to bring these varying levels of support and supervision across the city to one approved level of quality.  </p>
<p>Ms Gill concluded that, “Everyone deserves to live in a decent home whether that is in social housing, their own property or exempt provision. Where they are not, I will be progressing the case with the council, police and the regulator.” </p>

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has accused the Government of threatening the future of farming in the county, after it was revealed they are encouraging farmers to leave the industry without any plans to replace them.</p>
<p>Last month the Government announced a new retirement scheme to support farmers who wish to leave the industry, freeing up land for new entrants.</p>
<p>However in response to a Written Parliamentary Question from Tim, the Farming Minister Victoria Prentis revealed that no analysis has actually been done on the number expected to take up the scheme, nor how many new entrants will replace them.</p>
<p>Instead, the Government just say that they "think" that new workers will enter the industry.</p>
<p>Tim said<em>: "This is massively concerning.</em></p>
<p><em>"Cumbria's farmers already face huge uncertainty thanks to the Conservatives' failure to protect animal welfare standards in the trade deal with Australia and the cuts to farm support payments without the replacement even being ready.</em></p>
<p><em>"Now the Government is actively encouraging farmers to leave the industry, with no idea who will replace them.</em></p>
<p><em>"But we know this isn't happening by accident. The Government's refusal to step in and save Newton Rigg agricultural college shows how little they care about the future of farming in places like Cumbria.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Conservatives have taken farmers for granted for too long - it's time they started listening to local farmers before there are none left to listen to".</em></p>

    <title>Attending the Travel Day of Action Campaign</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of joining campaigners outside of Parliament for the Travel Day of Action, fighting against the Government’s handling of covid travel restrictions.</p>



<p>I met with South Shields based travel agent, Graeme Brett, owner of Westoe Travel to discuss the ongoing challenges facing the travel industry. Graeme attended alongside a wide range of organisations from across the aviation and travel industries aiming to put pressure on the Government to support a safe return to international travel in time for the peak summer period.</p>



<p>The travel industry has been let down badly throughout the pandemic and the Government must provide sector-specific support and finance to all those affected. No other industry has been left in the dark like this and we’re going to see more and more travel agencies getting boarded up and people losing their jobs if we don’t act.</p>



<p>I believe the current traffic light system doesn’t work, it sends unclear messages to both business and travellers. With the promotion of clear and consistent public health messages and good measures in place, international travel could return.</p>



<p>Last week I voted against the extension of the covid roadmap restrictions. The virus will be with us for the long haul and repeated lockdowns and constant restrictions is not a long-term strategy. I believe we need to make a start reopening safe international travel and reap the benefits of our country’s vaccination programme.</p>



<p>For all who have lost their jobs and are fighting to re-open travel, I will continue to fight with you.</p>

    <title>Scalpay back online after community call in MP for help</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/06/23/scalpay-back-online-after-community-call-in-mp-for-help/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Residents on Scalpay are back online after nearly two months of service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scalpay Community Council contacted Angus MacNeil MP to alert him to the disruption faced by around 20 households who were affected by an ongoing broadband problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disruption to service was causing problems for those working from home due to Covid-19 restrictions and for local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kenny Macleod, Secretary of Scalpay Community Council, and one of those affected, said: “After weeks of being given different stories and being told it was fixed, we got in touch with our MP, Mr MacNeil, and are very grateful for his intervention which has undoubtedly speeded up the resolution of our problems.&amp;nbsp; If he hadn’t intervened and got the engineers onto the ferry, we would probably still be waiting for it to be fixed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are all hugely dependant on a good, reliable internet connection and not having it for so long caused lots of problems. Hopefully now these are resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil had contacted Openreach to try to push forward a solution and was very pleased when it was confirmed to him that a team was set to travel to the island imminently to work on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openreach then contacted Mr MacNeil for assistance due to the difficulties they were facing in securing a ferry booking to the island and Mr MacNeil then contacted Calmac to stress the urgency of the situation and a ferry booking was made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team carried out works and although not all issues have been overcome, households have now been reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The engineers replaced the dishes on the 18Ghz radio link at both ends, but they are still waiting on parts for the 32g link which need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional works are due to be carried out to increase speeds when parts arrive, however Openreach state there are no live faults in this area and services are now operating as normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openreach are also looking at providing additional weatherproofing to try and stop the problems occurring again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased that I was able to assist the community on Scalpay in moving towards a resolution to this problem which was causing disruption to everyday life and was understandably frustrating for residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I cannot fix all problems which constituents raise with me, but I would encourage people to get in touch and I will do all I can to assist.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s great to be back on constituency days again. Being out and about in the constituency.</p>
<p>“Meeting people, visiting schools is vital work for any constituency MP and frankly the kind of thing which has been really difficult to do during COVID. It’s just not the same when you’re on a Zoom video- fantastic to be back out in person.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr Shapps’ first visited recently painted murals in subways by the station in Hatfield.</p>
<p>Two pedestrian subways in Hatfield have been transformed into works of art, to provide safe and attractive walking and cycling routes between Hatfield Station and Hatfield House.</p>
<p>Badgers, butterflies, balloons, and bicycles are just some of the colourful new images to be seen in the transformed subways, along with murals celebrating Hatfield’s role in the development of the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>The improvements to the subways have been undertaken by Hertfordshire County Council in partnership with Network Rail and supported by Hatfield House and the local community. The redecoration is part of a programme of works to brighten and improve pedestrian subways across Hertfordshire to make walking and cycling more attractive options for residents.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>At the site, Mr Shapps- who is also Transport Secretary- said: “To bring together so many organisations and agencies to all work on the same project is really impressive. It’s also lovely to note that lots of school children were involved in creating these murals.</p>
<p>It supports something I’ve been saying for a long time- if you want people to active travel, their surroundings need to be pleasant, and well looked after. I’ve cycled through these subways quite a lot and I’ve got to say they’re looking so much better. My congratulations to all involved.”</p>
<p>Phil Bibby, Herts County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport, said: “Improving these subways in Hatfield is part of a wider programme to encourage active travel and reduce car use across the county.</p>
<p>Walking and cycling have so many direct benefits to both physical and mental health, and if everyone made a few more journeys on foot or bike, and a few less in the car, that would have a big impact on air quality, and therefore on everyone’s health. That’s why improving routes like these is so important to us.”</p>
<p>Next stop for Mr Shapps was Stanborough School in Welwyn Garden City, where he met with Headteacher Merry John to tour the school, check on its progress, and open a newly completed Music &amp; Drama block.</p>
<p>The opening, at which teachers, governors and students attended, Mrs John said: “This new block is a fantastic base for our young musicians and performers- they deserve the best. I’m really pleased to see that during lunchtime, during lessons, it’s a thriving place for our students. Thank you so much to Grant for being able to join us for the official opening.”</p></div>

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-35/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with another update about the Coronavirus pandemic and some other local issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, as you will probably be aware, the Prime Minister has taken a decision to extend the remaining restrictions until the end of the 18th July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summary of the current rules is &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEDDINGS AND CIVIL PARTNERSHIP CEREMONIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two exceptions to this. The first is that the limit of 30 people allowed to attend a wedding has been removed, though a number of conditions remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details of this are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-wedding-and-civil-partnership-ceremonies-receptions-and-celebrations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARE HOME RESIDENTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition care home residents are now allowed to spend a night away from their homes without having to isolate on their return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details are here:&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/care-home-residents-can-stay-overnight-as-visiting-restrictions-ease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SURREY COVID CASES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent increase in cases in Surrey has mostly affected younger people who are yet to be vaccinated and those who have only had a single jab. This does underline how important it is that people who are still unvaccinated or who have yet to book in for their second jab and are eligible to do so book an appointment now. You can do so via the NHS website at;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest figures for Surrey are &lt;a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/263691/Surrey_covid-19_infographic_1106.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHALK PIT EPSOM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know many people remain extremely concerned about the noise and dust nuisance coming from the Chalk Pit in College Road, Epsom at the moment. I have been working with local residents on the issue and pushing the Environment Agency to act. I have had several meetings with the Agency and they have been working through a formal process which I hope will reach a resolution in the next few days. Please keep updating me if you experience serious noise or dust from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CITIZENS ADVICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epsom and Ewell Citizens Advice team have asked me to remind people that if they are having difficulties as a result of the pandemic or some other issue, they are often able to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their latest details and contacts &lt;a href="http://www.caee.org.uk/get-advice/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much hope that we can move on from the pandemic very soon and everyone will be able to enjoy the rest of the summer. As always, if you have questions or issues please feel free to email me, though please use my Parliamentary address as this message comes from a no reply service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Grayling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RT Hon Chris Grayling MP&lt;br /&gt;
Member of Parliament for Epsom and Ewell&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith welcomes agreement on Bulls Elite Academy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/mp-welcomes-agreement-on-bulls-elite-academy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to news that Bradford Bulls will now continue to run an Elite Academy, Bradford South Labour MP Judith Cummins said, “I’m pleased that the club and the RFL have reached a resolution that enables Bradford to continue to run an Elite Academy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would, however, have been better for all concerned to have avoided the worry and trauma in the first place,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ms Cummins had challenged the RFL on the process and decision that saw Bradford losing out in the award of Elite Academy licences. She questioned whether quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and deep roots into the community game had been given little weight in the consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Bulls Academy has been productive and respected for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There remain challenges ahead but I’m looking forward to working with and supporting the club and the RFL to make sure that the sport has a healthy future,” said Ms Cummins.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Great to be at Dafen Primary School yesterday to see them become the world’s first Global Entrecompedu Pioneer School.</p>



<p>Pupils, staff and many others involved with the school have worked really hard to embrace the scheme which gives children of all year groups the skills and knowledge needed to understand the world of business and commerce.</p>



<p>Particularly inspiring to hear directly from the children about how they put protecting the environment and collaborating with others at the centre of their work.</p>



<p>Congratulations to everyone involved and good luck with helping to share your experiences with other schools in the local area and across the UK and Europe!</p>

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dan Jarvis - Message of Solidarity on Worker's Memorial Day</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.danjarvis.org/iwmd21" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
