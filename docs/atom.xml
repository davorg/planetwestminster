    <title>The long road to net zero</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/02/06/the-long-road-to-net-zero/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soon hear of the Earth Summit in April to be set up by the USA. It will be followed by the Petersberg Group on climate change in May and the G7 in June, leading inexorably to the big global UN conference, COP 26 in Scotland in November. The aim of each of these meetings is to establish firm pledges from countries on how quickly they will bring down the carbon dioxide and wider greenhouse gas output of their countries. The world establishment now wants shorter term targets and tough realistic pledges on the long road to net zero by the middle of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my readers welcome this, and others are sceptical about various aspects of the climate change movement. I am writing this accepting the twin facts that governments believe there is a serious manmade climate problem created by greenhouse gas production, and intend to do many things to control and reduce the output of these gases. There are  no mainstream political parties  with a reasonable number of MPs taking a different view in Europe and the UK, and it is likely the Republicans after Trump will move closer to the Democrat position. International bodies and civil services are enthusiasts for this theory, and welcome the radical policies it ushers in. We are in for many more bans, rules, controls, and taxes to wean us off fossil fuel based goods and services, and for more subsidies and state sponsored investments to build the new green economy. Costs and charges of various products and supplies will be pushed up to discourage use. As the UK Climate Change Committee proposes, they want change in how we travel, in how we heat and cool our homes and workplaces, how we generate our electricity, how many products are produced in factories and in what we eat. They wish to see a reduction in meat and diary products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to hear your reactions to this, and to know how you will change your conduct if at all in the light of the likely changes to come.&lt;/p&gt;

The ban on care home visits has been a scandal, and taken a terrible toll on families and residents.</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">Tens of thousands of care home residents have been unable to receive visits from their families for almost a year. The Government introduced limited visiting introduced late last year, but scrapped it when the second wave hit.</p>
<p>We need to recognise the anguish that separation has caused families, as well as the role that family members play in providing care, supporting residents mental and physical health.&nbsp;This is true not only for care home residents with dementia, but also for working age adults with physical and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>I first wrote to Matt Hancock urging for visits to resume back in June. We now need urgent action to reunite families, and make it a legal right to visit.</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-42/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Another very busy week in Westminster. Here is a flavour of some of the events in which I took part.</p>
<p>On Monday morning I attended a zoom call for local MPs and MSs organised by the trade union PCS concerning the anxiety over the reported number of Covid-19 cases in the DVLA from March 2020 to date. The Chief Executive and the Head of HR at the DVLA were called to give evidence to the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/489bc95f-a9c3-4aaa-bb3c-1cc5d29a130b">Parliamentary Transport Select Committee</a> last Tuesday and members of the committee were less than satisfied at some of the answers to the evidential questioning. Since the first Covid-19 cases were reported, Swansea City Council, SBUHB, and PHW have been urging the DVLA to introduce adequate social distancing measures on all its sites, reduce numbers of workers actually working on its sites by increasing those working from home, and to make sure that transport provided by the DVLA is Covid-19 secure. I have been contacted by constituents who live in Neath and work at the DVLA who are so worried about contracting Covid-19, but wish to remain anonymous, because they are afraid of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I joined the Gaps in Support APPG, of which I’m a vice-chair. We heard from representatives of the creative sector, BECTU, Equity and the Producers Association, whose members have received inadequate, or no support, from the UK Government during this pandemic. Tracy Brabin MP introduced the speakers by stating that had she remained an actor on Coronation Street, she would have been one of those excluded from UK Government support schemes. Members in the creative sector are sole traders, Ltd companies and PAYE/freelancers, service companies and new starters, who do not qualify for UK Government grants. Many working in this sector supplement their income by working in hospitality, but that isn’t possible. So many are in serious debt, are suffering mental health issues and are leaving the sector.</p>
<p>Our APPG has written many letters to the Chancellor about gaps in support, and we have <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1357345787320037379?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">written again</a> this week following the Chancellor’s comments that 3 million is not a number that he recognises. There are 2.93 million people who have had little or no support from the UK Government according to ONS and SEISS statistics, as of January 2021. The Chancellor also said that it is not right to describe these people as excluded. But they are. There are more than 1.4 million people excluded from the SEISS scheme because the majority of their income does not come from being self-employed (the 50/50 group), and more than half of these have a personal income of less than £25,000 and 45% are women who are combining jobs. They cannot be furloughed and cannot claim SEISS. The self-employed and small business sector make up 99.3% of the business population and the Chancellor should support them.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I joined the APPG for Sport discussing how the sport and physical activity sector can get back on its feet post Covid-19. We listened to the Minister for Sport, Heritage and Tourism, Nigel Huddleston and the Chief Executive of Sport England, Tim Hollingsworth. The speakers focused on the effect on grassroots sport and looked at what the sector needs to survive and thrive in the future. Although sport is devolved to the Welsh Government and governed by Sport Wales, there are many similarities affecting this sector, in England and Wales, and as vice-chair of this APPG, and a former athlete, I am passionate about sport and highlighting the tremendous physical and mental health and well being benefits gained from participation in physical exercise.</p>
<p>It’s National HIV Testing Week, and people are being urged to <a href="https://www.friskywales.org/chlamydia-and-gonorrhoea-home-testing-pilot.html">order a home HIV test</a>. There are an estimated 6,700 people in the UK who are undiagnosed. This is a condition which nowadays can be treated successfully, but if untreated can lead to very serious medical conditions and fatalities. On Thursday I joined the APPG for HIV/AIDS where we received presentations from the Elton John Foundation, who are running projects in London Boroughs to identify new cases of HIV and direct them to HIV care, but also identify historical cases where individuals are aware of their HIV status, but for whatever reason, are not receiving treatment. Social Impact Bonds from private and philanthropic funders are being used to work with public sector providers. There is still unwarranted stigma attached to testing positive for HIV, which may explain why individuals do not seek treatment. By changing HIV testing to an opt-out system in these projects, testing is normalised, and very few individuals refuse, whereas in opt-in schemes, refusals are common. Raising awareness in communities is vital in reassuring individuals that contracting HIV is no ones fault.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, I was honoured to be re-elected as co-chair of the APPG for Pro Bono and Public Legal Education when the APPG was reconstituted after falling into abeyance during the pandemic, because our secretariat LawWorks was involved in changing a face to face Pro Bono model into a remote and online model. We made plans to hold evidence sessions to discuss the impact of Covid-19 regulations on communities. I’m proud that Richard Owen of Swansea Law Clinic, in the Hillary Clinton School of Law, Swansea University, won the LawWorks Cymru 2020 award. The law clinic works with 7 law firms and 3 charities to provide free legal advice to individuals with legal problems, but without the means to pay. Students take part and are mentored by law professionals, and experience law in action, rather than law in books.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening I joined the Zoom public meeting organised by the Coal Authority for residents in Skewen who have been seriously affected by the flooding caused by a blowback from a disused mine shaft. Over 80 residents were evacuated from their homes on 21st January, and many were on the call to ask questions of the Coal Authority. The vast majority of individuals affected by the flooding reside in Aberavon constituency, but there are two properties in my constituency. The meeting was chaired by the local councillor Mike Harvey, who has been doing an excellent job, working non-stop to represent his constituents. Other attendees were the MP and MS for Aberavon; the Leader and Deputy Leader of NPT Council; the Chief Executive and Director of Planning, NPT Council; the Salvation Army, and local agencies. Cllr Harvey thanked everyone who had helped the residents, those who had donated clothes and money to the residents fund, and looked forward to when the affected area is made safe, so that residents can return to their homes.</p>
<p>This week Labour put forth a motion to call on the Government to urgently establish the extent of dangerous cladding and prioritise buildings according to risk; to provide upfront funding to ensure cladding remediation can start immediately; to protect leaseholders and taxpayers from the cost by pursuing those responsible for the cladding crisis; and to update Parliament once a month in the form of a Written Ministerial Statement by the Secretary of State. It is unconscionable that 3 years after the appalling tragedy that hit the residents in Grenfell Tower, there are still so many people living in high-rise buildings with unsafe cladding. Not only are they faced with the costs of remediation, but also with the cost of maintaining Waking Watches until that remediation can be carried out. The Government are dragging their heels and leaseholders are unable to move from their properties with no financial assistance. Sky-high insurance premiums are adding to the anxiety and worries of those living in these buildings. Despite many Conservative MPs speaking up in this debate for their constituents in such a situation, they failed to perform their duty and vote for our proposal, leaving the Government with free rein to continue dodging their responsibilities.</p>
<p>This Thursday we marked World Cancer Day, another important date that has gained a new significance during this pandemic. Coronavirus has thrown much of our lives into disarray, but for those facing a cancer diagnosis and treatment, this is another challenge to overcome and something that has made the cancer journey all the more difficult. The pandemic has also caused some reluctance in seeking advice for potential cancer symptoms –  but I would urge that if you have any symptoms that you are worried or unsure about, you should contact your GP. They are still there for you and it is important that if there is anything amiss, that it is caught as soon as possible. For those facing treatment, this must be an incredibly difficult time, especially as many of the restrictions mean family members may not be able to support you physically. However, Macmillan Cancer Support are still there to provide advice, information, and support and can be contacted 7 days a week, 8am-8pm, on 0808 808 00 00.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my role as MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <title>That’s what Friends are for – my weekly article for the Tameside Reporter</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/thats-what-friends-are-for-my-weekly-article-for-the-tameside-reporter/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=thats-what-friends-are-for-my-weekly-article-for-the-tameside-reporter" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233283" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Friends-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Friends-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Friends-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Friends-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Friends-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Friends.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;If you are a regular reader of this column, you will know how much I love the Tame Valley, the ribbon of beautiful green space that follows the River Tame through Tameside and Stockport. It gives a great deal of pleasure to residents and is also a haven for wildlife. This is why I’m so strongly opposed for plans to extend the industrial estate at Bredbury in Stockport into this precious greenbelt land when there are so many brownfield sites available in Greater Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;However, protecting our Tame Valley isn’t just about preventing industrial spread, it’s also about making sure that the rest of the area is well-maintained and well-kept. Whilst there are many sections that are protected – such as the Hulmes and Hardy Woods and Haughton Dale Local Nature Reserves, other sections are in private hands and not necessarily maintained to the standards that are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;This is why, along with local Councillors, I’m looking to establish “The Friends of the Tame Valley” as a group that would help to secure improvements to the section of the valley running from Shepley Woods in Audenshaw, through Jet Amber Fields, and along the Upper Haughton and Whittles Meadows to Mill Lane in Haughton Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Whilst some brilliant local residents and dog walkers litter-pick in parts of Jet Amber Fields, other parts need some serious care and attention. Limited maintenance has meant badly worn footpaths, missing signposts, broken fences, neglected trees and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;We want all of the valley cared for so that it can be enjoyed by the whole community. The new Friends group would hold the various landowners to account, as well as fundraise and bit for grants for improvements so that it’s fit for the next 40 or 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;There are many fantastic Friends groups across Tameside that do so much to look after our collective environment and heritage, whether that’s train stations, parks, historic buildings or green spaces. If we get this right, this group will do the same for some of the more neglected sections of our wonderful Tame Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;If you’re interested in getting involved, email me at&lt;span class="apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:GwynneA@parliament.uk"&gt;GwynneA@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and I’ll send you a Zoom link to the inaugural AGM on Tuesday 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class="apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;February at 7pm. Together, we can secure improvements to the Tame Valley that will ensure that it continues to provide joy and comfort to Tamesiders (both human and animal!) for many generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>RELEASE: Gove admits post Brexit chaos “not just teething problems”</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/release-gove-admits-post-brexit-trade-chaos-not-just-teething-problems/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=release-gove-admits-post-brexit-trade-chaos-not-just-teething-problems" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Commenting on Michael Gove’s admission that post Brexit trade issues are not just “teething problems” but “significant issues” that could risk livelihoods, the SNP’s newly appointed International Trade spokesperson, Drew Hendry MP, said:</p>
<p>“After a month of the Tory government insisting that the huge issues exporters and hauliers have faced at the border are just ‘teething problems’, it seems that finally a UK minister has taken his head out of the sand and is waking up to the reality that their bad Brexit deal is having a real and devastating impact on real people and businesses.</p>
<p>“We can only hope the rest of the Cabinet will follow and action is taken to protect people’s livelihoods and businesses. The UK government must immediately suspend fines, introduce a grace period for exporters and hauliers and make good on the Prime Minister’s promise to deliver compensation for businesses affected by the trade difficulties.</p>
<p>“It is wrong that Scotland’s industries, workers and ultimately, consumers are paying the price for a Tory Brexit it didn’t vote for, as well as the hubris, lies and broken promises that just keep coming from Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and the rest of the UK Cabinet.</p>
<p>“The SNP and industry leaders have been calling for action on these issues for weeks now – the situation is now beyond urgent as businesses continue to lose millions of pounds of overseas sales a day and customers look elsewhere for their produce.</p>
<p>“This Tory Brexit was a completely unnecessary act of economic vandalism, which has been inflicted against Scotland’s will. It is now beyond doubt that the only way to protect Scotland’s interests and our place in Europe is to become an independent country.”</p>

  <title>MP asks Vaccines Minister to clarify vaccine prioritisation for unpaid carers</title>

  <summary type="text">In Parliament this week, South Lakes MP Tim Farron urged ministers to clarify whether unpaid carers are on the priority list for COVID-19 vaccines.
Last month, unpaid carers were included in group six in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's list.
However they are still missing on the Government's Vaccines Delivery Plan and its summary list of priority groups, which is often shared by media to inform the public of who is on the priority list.</summary>

<p>However they are still missing on the Government's Vaccines Delivery Plan and its summary list of priority groups, which is often shared by media to inform the public of who is on the priority list.</p>
<p>Speaking during a ministerial statement on COVID-19, Tim said: <em>"Unpaid carers provide a huge service to our community here in South Lakeland but especially to those people who they care for directly and if they get ill that's a huge welfare risk for those people that they care for.</em></p>
<p><em>"But there's been confusion over whether unpaid carers will be prioritised for the vaccine because although the Government said they would be in priority group six they are missing from other communications including the summary list in the Vaccines Delivery Plan.</em></p>
<p><em>"So I wonder if the minister would now agree to clarify once and for all that unpaid carers, rightly will be on the priority list."</em></p>
<p>Responding, the Minister for Vaccine Deployment, Nadhim Zahawi said: <em>"We are absolutely looking to make sure that unpaid carers are on the priority list."</em></p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A familiar feeling of dread hung over South Yorkshire with amber flood warnings issued across the region in recent weeks. Our communities were at action stations as residents began the arduous task of preparing to withstand the worst of the weather. Our Local Authorities, Emergency Services, Yorkshire Water, the Environment Agency and volunteers worked around the clock to prepare for Storm Christoph. Within 24 hours, gullies and drains were cleared, river levels were monitored, and 43,750 sandbags had been delivered to local residents – testament to the efforts of hundreds of staff and volunteers.</p>

Shropshire CCG were in charge, RAF medics were doing the jabs, volunteers from Shropshire Fire &amp; Rescue managed the car parking, community volunteers were stewards and Shropshire Council staff ran the administration.

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another large hub opened a few days earlier at Telford International Centre. Last week every care home resident across the county had been offered a vaccine against Covid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another massive effort was made by all the GP practices in the south west over the past seven days to ensure that all the over-80s in the community had been contacted, with 9 out of 10 over-80s in Shropshire now having been vaccinated with their first dose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The practices around Bridgnorth continue to power ahead very efficiently. Across Shropshire over 50% of the over 75s have been vaccinated as attention turns to the priority groups 3 and 4, which is anyone over 70 and those younger who are clinically extremely vulnerable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some are not able to take up their vaccine straight away, as they may be in isolation for 10 days or being treated for another condition, so their immune system may not yet be ready to cope with the vaccine. But we are on track in Shropshire to vaccinate the top four priority groups by mid-February. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I want to put right one misconception being put about locally that the top four groups will not be vaccinated until the end of March in Shropshire. This is not correct, and it is not fair to stoke anxiety for local residents. To be clear: 31st March is the target to complete the top 9 priority groups, which includes everyone over 50 and those younger with clinical vulnerability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latest research confirms the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine offers sustained protection after a single dose for 12 weeks and has a positive effect on Covid19 transmission, reducing positive test results by two thirds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Vaccine Taskforce has moved with great skill and agility to ensure the UK has sufficient vaccines – Kate Bingham and her team deserve a lot of credit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But we are not out of the woods yet. The South Africa strain shows the need for continued vigilance. Numbers are moving the right way in Shropshire – let’s make sure we keep it that way, while vaccines offer protection to those most at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Urgent Covid Statement 02/02/2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2021/02/04/covid-variant/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I asked the Health Secretary if the UK Government are planning to tighten internal UK travel restrictions to stop the spread of the new South African variant of Covid. It comes almost a year after I raised the issue of border health controls right at the start of the pandemic. With the UK still only planning hotel quarantine for a limited number of countries, from which travel is already banned, the Scottish Government is now considering introducing tougher measures here to stop new strains and variants coming into the country as happened last summer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also asked whether the UK Government would increase random genomic testing of PCR specimens to identify how widespread this new variant already is. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, the Health Secretary claimed the UK Government set up genomic testing across the UK in the face of Covid. However, Scotland has had a National Genetic Service for years and began the Scottish Genome Partnership in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, I asked whether the UK Government would tighten minimal quarantine restrictions to prevent the spread of new foreign Covid variants.  Countries like Taiwan and Hong Kong use quarantine hotels and designated taxis to avoid Covid spread on public transport and to prevent transmission of new variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Philippa Whitford MP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I associate myself with the Secretary of State’s comments on HIV test week, but it is concerning to hear that over 100 cases of the South African variant have been detected in the UK, particularly as they do not represent a single outbreak, but are widely scattered across England. The concern, of course, is that while current vaccines will still give a significant degree of protection, this variant’s resistance to some covid antibodies could reduce their effectiveness, so does he plan to tighten internal travel restrictions to avoid it spreading across the UK as happened with the Kent variant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will there be increased random genomic testing of PCR specimens outwith those areas to identify just how widespread it already is? Unfortunately, this is shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted. The Government have been aware of the concern about this variant for some time, and the SAGE advisory group warned that limited travel bans would not be enough to keep out new covid variants and that the only way to stop them would be mandatory quarantine for all arrivals, so why did the Government choose not to follow that advice? This variant is already present in many countries and new, more resistant covid variants could evolve anywhere in the world, so will the Government reconsider their very minimal quarantine plan and extend it to all incoming travellers? As new strains brought in through holiday travel last year contributed to the second wave of covid, is the Prime Minister seriously suggesting that people should go abroad on holiday this summer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hancock MP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the SNP spokeswoman failed to mention is that it is only because we built the huge genomic surveillance capacity that we now have, which is available right across the UK, that we have been able to spot these variants of concern. This is a critical point, because those sorts of variation happen everywhere, but the challenge is to spot them as soon as we can and act on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hon. Lady asked about travel. We already have in place rules against all non-essential travel, with clear “stay local” guidance. We also have mandatory isolation for new arrivals, so yes, we have tightened in response to the new evidence that she mentioned, but she did not also mention the fact that it is only because the vaccine programme is rolling out so rapidly across the whole UK that we are able to protect people against the old variant, which of course is the most widespread, in combination with the variant discovered in Kent. That is the way that we will get out of this situation. It is a UK programme, and we are enthusiastic and willing, from the UK Government point of view, to do everything we possibly can to support that roll-out, including all the way across Scotland, to make sure that people in Scotland and every other part of this United Kingdom can get their jab as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>As of <strong>Thursday 04 February</strong>, the office of Jon Cruddas MP can be found on the London East Business and Technical Park opposite Dagenham East station. Jon and his team will be moving in with Unite the Union at a purpose-built office space.</p>
              <p>The new postal address should constituents wish to contact their MP is:</p>

              <p>For constituents intending to hand deliver letters, please be advised that at present we do not have an external post box. This is due to be installed in the coming week.</p>
              <p>Jon’s office receives hundreds of phone calls each week from constituents in need of help, for this reason the office number will remain the same. However, BT have advised that the change over could take between a matter of hours to a couple of days.</p>
              <p>If constituents are unable to get a response on the usual number: <strong>020 8984 7854</strong> then a temporary number will be available until the issue is resolved.<strong> </strong></p>
              <p>
                <strong>The temporary number is: 07907 654983.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Please also be advised that staff will continue to work from home until government guidelines permit otherwise. So, constituents are asked not to arrive at the new office seeking the MP for the time being. Please use one of the contact methods listed above.</p>
              <p><strong>Jon Cruddas said:</strong> <em>“people imagine a glamorous world of politics, but the reality is that my first office was prone to heavy flooding, my second was out of the way on the old A13, then we moved into what was the Tenants Federation office, which wasn’t without its issues but put us more central for residents to access. This move is most welcome, and I thank Unite for having us. I know the staff are looking forward to settling in once we can return to more of a normal setup.”</em></p>

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, virtually met PC James Stothard and South East Holderness Ward Councillors, Lyn Healing and David Tucker, to congratulate James on his new position as Beat Manager and to discuss challenges facing the town.</p>
<p>Like many coastal towns, Withernsea has long-standing issues with anti-social behaviour, drug use, and rural crime. PC Stothard is keen to work with the local community to help tackle these issues. He has been a Police Officer for 16 years, mostly locally based and he’s looking for opportunities for young people in Withernsea.  Police recognise boredom is one the biggest causes of anti-social behaviour.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed how important it is to engage young people and intervene early to stop children from getting into trouble.  Many who commit petty crimes at a young age escalate to more serious offences.  Ideas for potential initiatives and activities in the community were discussed, and the MP and Councillors will explore further.</p>
<p>PC Stothard urged residents to report incidents and issues to Humberside Police so officers can build an intelligence picture and take action to keep the community safer.</p>
<p>Graham said, “Withernsea is a fantastic place and it was great to chat with James, Lyn and Dave about local challenges.  There is so much that can be done and I am keen to work with the Council and the Police.  We must include the whole community and crack down on the anti-social behaviour.  I look forward to putting our ideas into action”. </p>
<p>PC James Stothard said, “We had a really useful chat discussing how we could engage the children and young people in Withernsea and encourage them to use their time productively. Everyone was really enthusiastic, and I believe that some great progress can be made for the area.”</p>
<p>Cllr Lyn Healing said, “It is an exciting prospect to give the children in Withernsea the opportunity to do some activities and for them to have something to put their energy into – I hope that this can be a successful project.”</p>
<p>Cllr Dave Tucker said, “The kids in Withernsea are craving attention which has been exacerbated by the pandemic, so I am looking forward to working together to put these initiatives into action and stopping this downward spiral.”</p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP presses the Government for clarity as new analysis shows thousands of people in Bristol still living with Grenfell-style cladding</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/02/02/karin-smyth-mp-presses-the-government-for-clarity-as-new-analysis-shows-thousands-of-people-in-bristol-still-living-with-grenfell-style-cladding/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=karin-smyth-mp-presses-the-government-for-clarity-as-new-analysis-shows-thousands-of-people-in-bristol-still-living-with-grenfell-style-cladding" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost four years after the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, around 7,099 people in Bristol are still living in flats with flammable cladding.  Dangerous cladding renders flats unsellable, leaving many families affected unable to sell their homes and enduring months of lockdown in unsafe homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, pressed Minister for Housing, Christopher Pincher MP, to respond to a proposal by a cross-party Parliamentary group for a bond scheme to help pay for remedial works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parliament, Pincher suggested that developers, investors and building owners should be responsible for paying the cost of cladding removal and other work related to building safety only if they “have the means” to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Labour and Conservative MPs, including Karin, opposed the suggestion that leaseholders should be made to take out loans in order to pay for repair costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Karin Smyth MP voted for a Labour motion in Parliament calling on the Government to urgently establish the extent of dangerous cladding provide up-front funding to ensure cladding remediation can start immediately. However, Conservative MPs failed to show up for the vote when the division was called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been almost four years since Grenfell, yet only a handful of buildings in Bristol have had the urgent repairs needed to make them safe.  Lives have been put on hold as dangerous cladding renders flats unsellable, trapping thousands of people in unsafe homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recent statements made by the Housing Minister in Parliament were very concerning in suggesting leaseholders may have to shoulder the burden of paying for repairs.  I recently heard extremely worrying stories from constituents in Bedminster who are being asked to pay thousands of pounds in remediation bills that they cannot afford. It is essential that leaseholders should not be expected to pay bills to rectify problems with original construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has gone on for too long.  Every day that passes puts thousands of people at risk in Bristol.  We need to ensure everyone has a safe and secure place to live, and that those responsible are made to pay the costs.”&lt;/p&gt;The post &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/02/02/karin-smyth-mp-presses-the-government-for-clarity-as-new-analysis-shows-thousands-of-people-in-bristol-still-living-with-grenfell-style-cladding/"&gt;Karin Smyth MP presses the Government for clarity as new analysis shows thousands of people in Bristol still living with Grenfell-style cladding&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com"&gt;Karin Smyth&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Preet welcomes important cladding vote to protect leaseholders</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-welcomes-important-cladding-vote-protect-leaseholders" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP has welcomed the Labour motion that will call for upfront funding to ensure cladding remediation can start immediately.</p>
<p>Three years on from the Grenfell tragedy and there are still an estimated 11 million people around the country who are living in a state of fear; in dangerous buildings with flammable cladding. </p>
<p>Today, a new motion will be voted on that will call for major action to be taken by the Government. As well as asking for upfront funding for cladding remediation work to begin immediately, the motion also demands protection for leaseholders and taxpayers from the cost of pursuing those responsible for the cladding crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said, "If left to this Government, innocent leaseholders in my constituency, who bear no responsibility for this crisis, could be forced to pay for remediation work costing tens of thousands of pounds per apartment. This is completely unacceptable and is yet another example of the Government going back on their repeated promises to leaseholders that they shouldn’t bear this cost. </p>
<p>"Progress in fixing unsafe buildings since the Grenfell Fire in 2017 has been glacially slow, causing untold mental and financial stress for ordinary families. What some of my constituents have been through is appalling. Today, we will find out if the Government is on their side or not."
</p></blockquote>
<p>In Edgbaston, Birmingham, there are over 300 flats clad in unsafe materials and whose leaseholders are now trapped and unable to sell their properties. </p>
<p>Paula Shalloo, Member of the Steering Committee for Birmingham Leaseholder Action Group said, “Imagine waking up tomorrow to discover your apartment block is wrapped in flammable cladding and has other fire safety defects so serious that the whole building could burn to the ground in a matter of minutes. So serious that the fire service immediately insists on a 24-hour fire patrol, or ‘waking watch’.</p>
<p>“Your first instinct is to sell up and move but no mortgage provider will lend on an unsafe property, so you are stuck. You then receive an estimate of several million pounds for remediation work to make your building safe and are told that you and your fellow leaseholders will have to foot the bill. Your share of that bill could be anywhere from £40,000 to £100,000 depending on the size of your block.</p>
<p>“In a final hammer blow, your buildings insurance goes up by 1000%. For hundreds of homeowners in the West Midlands, this is not an imaginary scenario. This is the reality they live with every day due to the cladding scandal.”</p>

    <title>Judith Cummins MP launches Food Pantry to support local families</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-cummins-mp-launches-food-pantry-to-support-local-families/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Bradford South MP Judith Cummins visited The Sutton Centre in BD4 to launch their new Food Pantry which provides essential food and hygiene products to local families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open every Wednesday, the pantry asks for a donation of just £3 to fill a bag with a range of tinned goods, cereals and even fresh fruit, vegetables and bread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Kirkby of The Sutton Centre said&lt;/strong&gt;: “The pantry aims to take a bit of pressure off families by offering a great selection of essentials. Much of the produce is &lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;enerously donated by Inn churches and supported by Clarion Futures, and the small contribution we ask for means we are often able to keep the pantry topped up with fresh ingredients like fruit, veg and milk and eggs, so that families can make healthy, wholesome meals together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve also found that for many people, visiting the pantry and speaking to our staff and volunteers can be some of their only social interaction, so it’s also an opportunity to have chat and improve wellbeing. We’ve also been able to introduce users to some of our other local projects, such as employment support – so it’s very holistic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cummins MP said&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Food Pantry is just one of the many ways the team at The Sutton Centre have been supporting the community over the pandemic and is much needed during such difficult times. The team’s work to support the community over the past year has been inspirational.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MacNeil calls again on Cabinet Secretary to meet over island jobs.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/01/25/macneil-calls-again-on-cabinet-secretary-to-meet-over-island-jobs/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Benbecula_airport_building.jpg" alt="Benbecula Airport - Wikipedia" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is writing again to Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Michael Matheson, to discuss Mr Matheson’s refusal to meet regarding the airport situation in Stornoway and Benbecula where crucial island jobs are in the balance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am disappointed by the response from Michael Matheson, he was the longest to respond to the request to meet, a full month after Prospect Union, who responded within a day. Clearly at the moment we don’t need him to travel to the islands but just to meet with us virtually about these important island jobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On day one of this process I told HIAL that they had an agenda of centralising and empire building around their office in Inverness. HIAL are an out-of-control department who are damaging the islands.&amp;nbsp; Most of their airports are in the Islands yet their HQ is on the mainland. They should either have their HQ moved to the islands or be broken up. From the very beginning it was clear that they were wanting to centralise in Inverness, I challenged them on this at the start and I told them if they were going to centralise things to hub them in Benbecula or Stornoway. Clearly, they are wanting to empire build at their own head office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When there was an issue around the coastguard stations, the UK Government’s then Maritime Minister, Mike Penning MP, and accepted my invite to travel from London to Stornoway and didn’t leave it to his Government’s Maritime &amp;amp; Coastguard Agency, but instead took responsibility for government agency actions. He also met with concerned parties in London to discuss the issue too. It is now imperative that the Scottish Government intervene on this vital issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In our islands, our ferry company, our airlines and even our Gaelic bodies, as well as in this case HIAL, are headquartered in the mainland. It is galling that some of the few, high quality, island jobs are about to be removed by an arm of the Scottish Government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the Islands Act isn’t pointless, at the very least, it should be protecting these jobs. HIAL are damaging the islands, and this is not a good enough response from the Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary who should be overseeing their actions. The purpose of a virtual meeting is so we can all agree on the sets of facts surrounding this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I implore Michael Matheson to think again and to get around the table with the Civil Aviation Authority, Prospect Union, HIAL, the employees and elected representatives from the area, to make sure island jobs are not sold short.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ENDS &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has virtual tour of Busy Bees Nursery in Shire Park, WGC.</strong></p>



<p>Busy Bees Nurseries, the UKs largest nursery group, recently hosted Mr Shapps for a ‘virtual tour’ of their nursery in Welwyn Garden City.</p>



<p>Busy Bees, founded 37 years ago, operate 357 nurseries in the UK and 231 nurseries overseas including Singapore, Australia, Canada, Italy Ireland and the USA.</p>



<p>Founder Marg Randles led the meeting as they discussed the business and their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Shapps had been invited to tour the nursery in person. However, due to the new strain of the virus and national lockdown, it was decided that the tour should take place virtually.</p>



<p>Mr Shapps was shown the nursery’s facilities with a video which highlighted how the staff get children prepared for learning at school.</p>



<p>As part of their efforts to make their environment COVID-secure during lockdown, parents have to drop their children off at the front door. However, they can receive regular updates about their child throughout the day via an app called ParentZone.</p>



<p>In addition, the Busy Bees use a digital learning programme which parents can use with their children at home.</p>



<p>Remarking on his virtual tour, Grant Shapps said: “I was given a really polished virtual tour of the nursery. The facilities look great for the kids and are a testament to the interest that Marg and all the team have in the children’s positive development.</p>



<p>“The nursery looked incredibly welcoming- lots of rooms for different activities and age groups, with plenty of outdoor space. It’s great to see how well they’ve managed to adapt to the disruptive effect that COVID has had…It’s no wonder that they won a Queen’s Award for Enterprise a few years ago.</p>



<p>“I look forward to visiting in-person someday in the reasonably near future!”</p>

Below I have shared a frequently asked questions briefing I received from the British Society for Immunology . It provides a host of questions and answers about the Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the answers to the following questions apply only in relation to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and many will be different for other COVID-19 vaccines as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is eligible to receive the vaccine?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has prioritised people for vaccination based on their risk of serious COVID-19 disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The priority order, confirmed on 2nd December and subject to logistical challenges in rollout, is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.       Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.       All those 80 years of age and over; frontline health and social care workers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.       All those 75 years of age and over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.       All those 70 years of age and over; clinically extremely vulnerable individuals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.       All those 65 years of age and over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.       All individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.       All those 60 years of age and over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.       All those 55 years of age and over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.       All those 50 years of age and over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more vaccine becomes available, it will be rolled out to those in each descending group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are older people being prioritised over younger people who are out of the house working?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The priorities are based on reducing risk of harm. The immune system of older people differs from that of younger people and whilst the younger, working population are just as likely to become infected they are much, much less likely to become severely ill. An older person becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to result in severe COVID-19 disease. The biggest risk of mortality from COVID-19 comes with age, even more so than underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, for example, or being male or being in BAME groups. Each older generation has approximately 10 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 than the generation below it. When a vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing disease in older people, then they should be the first to receive it as they are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need to get the vaccine if I have contracted COVID-19 and recovered?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Yes. There is a lot of uncertainty about how much immunity a person gains after natural infection. The levels of immunity that we can measure so far show a lot of individual variation &amp;#8211; some people have very few antibodies after infection but these antibodies can be boosted by vaccination. We can’t assume that everyone who has had COVID-19 would have enough immunity to protect them. It is likely that, in a significant proportion of the population, the vaccine will induce more effective and longer lasting immunity than that induced by infection. Hence it is recommended that everyone take the vaccine so that, if your immunity after disease is absent or low, it can be boosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should a young person take the vaccine when the risk of COVID-19 mortality is so low?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;There is a huge variability in the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 disease between different people; from an infection with SARS-CoV-2 that doesn’t have any symptoms (asymptomatic infection) to severe COVID-19 disease resulting in hospitalisation and in some cases death. While younger people are usually at the less severe end of the spectrum this does not mean that the illness is not harmful to their health. In fact, there are many instances of long COVID that have blighted the lives of young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, although we don’t yet have a lot of evidence to support this, having the vaccine might stop you being able to be part of the chain of infection that spreads the virus. So, an added benefit might be to help reduce spread of the virus for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is COVID-19 at my child’s school. Why aren’t my children being given the vaccine?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Initial vaccine testing was not done on children. Children are at extremely low risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19 – they are at higher risk of being involved in a serious traffic accident than they are of ending up in hospital with Covid-19. So the benefits of vaccinating children are not yet clear. If the vaccine stops people from passing the infection to others, then vaccinating children in order to stop the spread of the virus will make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the vaccine being developed so quickly mean that it is less safe than other vaccines?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;No, it doesn’t. The reasons that this was developed so quickly do not include cutting corners on safety. There are a few reasons that enabled the speed in 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.       Technology. These mRNA vaccines (in common with many of the approaches used for the other vaccine candidates) could be rapidly deployed for development and testing once the SARS-CoV-2 sequence became known, but this was actually done on the back of 10 years prior research using this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.       Scientists. A LOT of scientists contributed to this, working extra long hours to make it work and to assess the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.       Money. Normally raising money to develop a vaccine takes a long time. At each stage you have to stop and apply for more funding to carry out the next stage. Funding applications take a year or more. In 2020 for SARS-CoV-2, rapid investment of a lot of taxpayers’ money in many countries meant there weren’t the normal financial obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.       Environment. Sometimes you can develop a vaccine but can’t test it until there is an epidemic in progress. There was no problem in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.       Luck. Sometimes the target that is picked for vaccine studies, which is usually something seen on the outside of the virus, is not a good candidate for raising an immune response. The S protein target on SARS-CoV-2 that most vaccine companies picked to work with turns out to be an excellent target for activating the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.       Volunteer test subjects. Last but definitely not least. Tens of thousands of volunteers took part in the safety trials and the randomised control trials so recruiting volunteers was not an issue as it may be under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any side effects from the vaccine?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Yes, but these are generally mild. As with all vaccines, because you are stimulating the immune system you may experience some mild flu-like symptoms, but these are temporary. The most common reactions are fatigue, headache and pain at the injection site. Some people might also get chills, joint pain or fever. Younger people are more likely to get these reactions than older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should people with allergies take the vaccine?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;There are varying degrees of allergy. Some allergies, such as hay fever, are mild and do not pose a risk. Others are more dangerous and can lead to immediate anaphylactic shock. The vaccine should not be given to people who have a history of immediate-onset anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food. If you carry an EpiPen in case of allergic reaction, you have a history of immediate-onset anaphylaxis and so should discuss this with your doctor before getting the vaccine. All people who are vaccinated are asked not to leave immediately so that the health care professionals can check there is no anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should not get the vaccine? (I’m immunocompromised/pregnant etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been tested on pregnant women or children so these groups should not be vaccinated, unless a child is at high risk of severe disease for some other reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunocompromised people are at high risk so should get the vaccine. However, because their immune systems may not be able to make a response to vaccine they should still take other precautions against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who was the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine tested on?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;There were 43,448 people in the phase 3 clinical trial, 21,720 of whom had the COVID-19 vaccine and the rest were given a placebo injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 58% were aged between 16 and 55, 42% were aged over 55 (the oldest being 89). 35% were classified as obese, 17% were BAME, 51% were male. Volunteers were from Argentina (15%), Brazil (6%), South Africa (2%) and USA (77%). People characterised as high risk due to underlying conditions (e.g. autoimmunity, hypertension; diabetes; asthma; pulmonary, liver, or kidney disease) or due to high risk occupations were included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there risks that might have been missed in the trials, but will become apparent in the longer term?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;All known risks have been checked, but there may be unknown risks. Reactions to vaccines usually happen very soon after vaccination – if you have the vaccine, you are asked to wait for a few minutes as a precaution. All the initial phase 1 safety trial volunteers have been followed up for at least 4 months and no major concerns have been raised. Safety monitoring, known as pharmacovigilance, is to be continued for 2 years after the vaccine is released – in the UK, this is carried out by the MHRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are long term side effects tested/monitored?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Safety monitoring is to be continued for 2 years after the vaccine is released. There is a system in place to monitor and report adverse events immediately in a process known as pharmacovigilance. In the UK, this is carried out by the MHRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the vaccine been tested on people of different ethnicities?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Yes, of the 21,720 volunteers who had the COVID-19 vaccine, 17% were BAME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does immunity from the vaccine last longer than immunity after getting COVID-19?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;We do not know the answer to this question yet because people have only been followed up for a maximum of 6 months after vaccination so far. We suspect that in some cases (e.g. mild or asymptomatic infection), the immunity elicited by the vaccine would be better than that elicited by the natural infection but we do not know for sure. But, from the concentrations of antibodies induced by the vaccine, and the rate at which these antibodies decline over time, it is looking very promising that immunity induced by the vaccine will last at least as long as the immunity induced by infection and in all likelihood it will last much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I still need to wear a mask or observe social distancing after receiving the vaccine?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Yes. We know the vaccine can protect people from getting sick from the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the viral infection. However, we do not yet know if it will stop you getting the viral infection so you could be an asymptomatic carrier who could pass the infection onto others who may be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you will not be fully protected against the disease until the second dose of vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, work?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The vaccine contains a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genetic material that codes for a specific protein from the virus. In the case of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the specific code is for the spike protein from the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The genetic material in the vaccine is mRNA, which is used as instructions for the cell to make proteins. When the vaccine is given, our cells at the site of injection take up the mRNA and make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is subsequently destroyed by the body. The spike protein is then recognised by the immune system and triggers a response. This response builds immune memory so your body can fight off SARS-CoV-2 immediately if you come across it in future. Please also see this infographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine still provide protection against the new strain of Coronavirus in the UK?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;We think it will, but we don’t yet know this for a fact. Scientists are currently carrying out tests in the lab to check this out. We expect to find out more about this in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nottingham Pension Fund Must Divest from Fossil Fuels</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of the actions of Nottingham City Council’s &lt;a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/media/2619917/2028-carbon-neutral-action-plan-v2-160620.pdf"&gt;Carbon Neutral Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; is to campaign for divestment and move the Nottinghamshire Local Government Pension Scheme away from fossil fuels investments. This is why ahead of their Annual General Meeting tomorrow I submitted a question on behalf of City members of the scheme, and urged the Fund to commit to consult with its members on a divestment strategy and timeline before their next AGM. This is essential to ensure the long term sustainability of the Fund and to play it’s part in the prevention of catastrophic climate change.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Pension Fund covers over 300 members including Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, the District Councils and many other organisations who are generally non-profit making, or are undertaking a service which was, or could be carried out by the Local Authority. It is controlled by County Councillors and the City Council has no voting rights on the Pension Fund.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I know that the primary responsibility of the Pension Fund is to protect the financial benefits of the scheme, and now that there is growing evidence that fossil fuel investments are performing less well than comparators it is the time to grasp the divestment nettle. Currently Nottinghamshire Pension Fund holds at least £170m in fossil fuel company shares and has no investments in sustainable, low carbon or renewable energy equity funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given over 1300 institutions worldwide have already committed to divestment, including at least 10 UK local government pension funds and a large number of UK universities and faith organisations, it is time for Nottinghamshire to catch up and  do its bit for a sustainable future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can watch the Nottinghamshire Pension Fund AGM live on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wdMyWgYd-gA"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt; from tomorrow at 10:30am. Further information about the agenda of the meeting and those in attendance can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/dms/Meetings/tabid/70/ctl/ViewMeetingPublic/mid/397/Meeting/5514/Committee/526/SelectedTab/Documents/Default.aspx"&gt;Nottinghamshire County Council website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal credit: Covid responsible for over 50% of claimants</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/universal-credit-covid-responsible-for-over-50-of-claimants/" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>In a House of Commons speech, I revealed that over half of the 14,633 Universal Credit (UC) claimants in my constituency are on social security since the start of the pandemic. I then urged the Government to keep the £20 ‘uplift’ for people claiming Universal Credit.</p>
<p>You can read my speech in full below:</p>
<p><em>Universal Credit (UC) has never been fit for purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>When introduced in 2012, it had a number of design flaws including the original 6-week wait for the first payment, a single payment to a household, usually the man, setting women’s independence back a generation, and a monthly payment period creating all sorts of problems for many who were paid weekly, fortnightly and 4-weekly.</em></p>
<p><em>But these were made even worse in 2015 when the then Chancellor did a hatchet job on social security spending. With the cuts to the taper rate and work allowance, the freeze on ‘benefit uprating’, the abolition of disability premiums, and more, by the start of the Covid pandemic approximately £33bn of support had been cut for working age people.  </em></p>
<p><em>Although for some people, UC is more slightly generous than legacy benefits, all the analysis I have seen has shown that UC is far less generous to single parent families and to disabled people.</em></p>
<p><em>UC claimants have been driven into debt, rent arrears and the increase in foodbank demand is attributed to UC’s introduction.</em></p>
<p><em>The associated negative impacts on UC claimants’ health and wellbeing is also now increasingly being understood. For example, a peer-reviewed report published in the Lancet last March showed people who moved onto Universal Credit experienced clinically significant psychological distress as a direct result. Another report from the BMJ showed that the ‘hostile and demeaning’ Universal Credit system worsened physical and mental health.  And the Health in all Policies All Party Parliamentary Group which I chair undertook an inquiry into the impacts of the changes to UC in the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Bill, predicting an increase in child poverty and a subsequent deterioration in child health; sadly, the follow analysis is showing how accurate these predictions were.</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, the discriminatory and punitive nature of UC has even been successfully challenged in the courts.</em></p>
<p><em>Fast forward to the start of the Covid pandemic, when we saw the number of UC claimants increase from over 3 million in March to over 5.6 million in July. As the crisis hit, not everyone could work from home and it was the low paid in vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and leisure who’ve been most affected. We know that this health crisis is far from over, and neither are impacts on the economy and jobs. People need reassurance, that in their time of need, like the NHS, an adequate safety net is there for them. </em></p>
<p><em>In my Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency more than half of the 14,633 claimants are now claiming UC as a result of the pandemic.</em></p>
<p><em>The response I have had from constituents about the debate in Parliament calling for the uplift to be extended has been phenomenal! And it wasn’t just those relying on UC who have written to me reflecting the Health Foundation/IPSOS Mori poll that showed 74% of the public support the increase in UC and want to see it extended beyond March.  </em></p>
<p><em>The UC APPG which I chair held an inquiry into the impact of Covid on claimants last spring and we wrote to the Chancellor with our recommendations last November. We urged him to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Retain the £20 per week uplift to standard allowance beyond April</em></li>
<li><em>Extend the £20 per week uplift to legacy benefits</em></li>
<li><em>Offer new UC claimants an initial non-repayable starter payment instead of making them wait 5 weeks for their first payment, as recommended by the Work and Pensions Select Committee</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I am still waiting for a reply to this letter.</em></p>
<p><em>Save The Children found that parents who were given the uplift predominantly used it to buy food, followed by paying the rent, bills, and essential items needed for school. They estimate that withdrawing this uplift will increase those living in poverty by half a million including 200,000 children. By 2024, the Resolution Foundation estimate that relative poverty will have increased to 23% with an additional 730,000 children living in poverty.</em></p>
<p><em>Even with this uplift people living on UC are struggling to manage. In November, Turn2Us examined the financial resilience of households on different social security support and found that 1 in 5 on UC ‘always’ run out of money compared with only 8% for people not reliant on UC.</em></p>
<p><em>Citizens’ Advice estimate that since the start of the pandemic half a million people have accrued rent arrears with an average of £730 debt. And of course, the ban on evictions also runs out at the end of March. The implications for homelessness are self-evident.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Speaker, as Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s Poverty report has shown, before Covid, there were 14.5 m people living in poverty, that’s 1 in 5 people, and this was escalating in spite of the high employment rate and an increase in the living wage. Work, seen by many as the route out of poverty was failing to deliver, with over 8 million working people living in poverty. 7 out of 10 of the 4m children living in poverty come from working families. Covid saw those already struggling to stay afloat bear the brunt of the economic and the health burden.</em></p>
<p><em>We cannot, we must not let them down. We must extend the UC and Working Tax Credit uplift, and ensure those on legacy benefits also receive the uplift.  </em></p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Emma Speaks Up for Traveling Showmen and Women</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-speaks-up-for-traveling-showmen-and-women/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ocean-beach-pleasure-park-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2969" srcset="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ocean-beach-pleasure-park-1-980x653.jpg 980w, https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ocean-beach-pleasure-park-1-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate entitled &lt;strong&gt;Future of fairs and Showgrounds&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted to support those showmen and women here in South Shields which has a long history of welcoming traveling showmen and women that dates back almost 100 years. It is imperative that the Government stops ignoring the fairground and showmen community and steps in to provide vital support before it is too late. As a longstanding supporter and advocate for show people and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fairs and Showgrounds, I will continue to be a voice for this community and press the Government at every opportunity for better support and recognition. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the pandemic, many fairs were either cancelled or postponed – from summer fetes to Christmas Markets. As a result of the closures and postponing of fairs, many show people suffered huge financial loss, plunging them into financial insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The heart of the issue is that the financial support offered to the tourism industry during COVID-19 continually excluded the fairground community. Showmen and women also did not qualify for the assistance announced in the recent budget for retail, leisure and hospitality firms relating to business rates in the coming year, due to the way that the Show people operate, which falls outside the scope of static leisure providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Show people across the UK and particularly those here in South Shields, now face losing their businesses and livelihoods if the UK Government does not step in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to write a script for an e-course</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/how-to-write-a-script-for-an-e-course/" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>Welcoming the Fantastic Ryanair Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianpaisleymp.co.uk/2016/01/11/welcoming-the-fantastic-ryanair-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br/>
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br/>
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br/>
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br/>
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br/>
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br/>
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br/>
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br/>
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
