<p class="xmsonormal">As the clock strikes midnight on 31st December each year, amidst all the hugging, drinking and Auld Lang Syne-ing, we all collectively hope that the year to come will be better than the last. For once, we can all be fairly confident that these hopes will be realised. Put bluntly, 2020 was a pig of a year and I’m fairly sure that we’re all delighted to see the back of it.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">We’ve all faced difficulties, whether it’s not seeing our families, losing jobs or businesses, feeling isolated and lonely or losing loved ones to the virus. As a community, the events that are normally such highlights – like ReddFest or Friends of Reddish Vale’s seasonal events – have been cancelled, along with countless birthday parties, weddings and religious festivals.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">In all these dark times though, 2020 did give us one very positive thing indeed and that was the launch of the newspaper that you hold in your hands (or are scrolling down online) right now! The Heatons Post has been a delight to read through these difficult times, full of positive stories about the brilliant things going on in Reddish and the Heatons despite the pandemic and the lockdown. Thanks to the Heatons Post team for all their hard work keeping the community connected and informed during this time!<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Just because we’re in 2021, the challenges that we face won’t magically disappear, but there is much to be hopeful about in this new year. Vaccines are being rolled out which will allow social distancing to be phased out, businesses will be able to reopen and we’ll be able to spend time with friends and family again. What’s more, if there’s one thing that 2020 taught us all, it’s how fantastic the community is we have here – together I believe we can support each other to make sure we all have a happier, healthier 2021.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span>Philip Dunne MP has welcomed measures the Government has put in place to help students receive remote education while schools are closed, including laptops and tablets for schools to allocate locally to students who need them, 4G routers for internet access, and video lessons made available via the Oak National Academy.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Throughout the pandemic, education has been a national priority, and thanks to the efforts of teachers and school staff across Shropshire, schools remain the best, and safest place for our children to learn. However, with the whole country in alert level 5, the highest it has ever been, the closure of schools is now necessary to keep the new variant of the virus under control. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Philip Dunne said: </span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The difficult decision to close schools and colleges was not taken lightly but is necessary if we are to keep the new variant of the virus at bay across the country. While nothing can ever replace the benefits of learning in a classroom for our children and young people, I am pleased the Government is again helping to make sure young people and children have access to high-quality remote learning so they can receive continuing education that they deserve and need.” </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>As part of the Government’s commitment that no child is left behind, it is providing a million laptops and tablets for schools to allocate locally to students who need them most. To date, it has delivered over 560,000 devices to councils in England, with students benefitting from the 560,000 devices provided to schools and colleges and a further 100,000 arriving this week nationally.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In tackling the barriers to remote learning for our most vulnerable students, over 54,000 4G routers to have been delivered to schools and colleges in England, helping children access the internet. The Government is building on this work through its partnership with the UK’s leading mobile phone providers, including EE, Three, O2 and Vodafone, to deliver free internet access for these students until July 2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Government has also supported provision of video lessons made available via the Oak National Academy, and strengthened remote education requirements for schools, monitored by Ofsted, so parents can be reassured that their children will benefit from a set number of hours of high-quality remote learning a day. </span></span></span></span></p></div>

  <summary type="text">This afternoon, South Lakes MP Tim Farron has written to the Prime Minister, asking him to provide immediate clarity on how far people are allowed to travel for exercise.
Currently, Government guidance states that "leaving home to exercise should be done locally wherever possible but you can travel a short distance within your area to do so if necessary."</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This afternoon, South Lakes MP Tim Farron has written to the Prime Minister, asking him to provide immediate clarity on how far people are allowed to travel for exercise.</p>
<p>Currently, Government guidance states that "leaving home to exercise should be done locally wherever possible but you can travel a short distance within your area to do so if necessary."</p>
<p>This has led to widespread confusion with Cumbria Police reporting incidents of people travelling hundreds of miles to do their exercise in the Lake District.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the other end of the spectrum, last week two women received fines of £200 each by Derbyshire Police after driving just five miles from their home for a walk.</p>
<p>In his letter to Boris Johnson, Tim asked for the Government to provide guidance similar to that in Scotland, where there is clear limit on how far people can exercise.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"Outdoor exercise is so important for both our physical and mental health.</em></p>
<p><em>"But the Government's very muddy guidance means we have this ludicrous situation where the police are reporting that people are travelling to the Lake District from as far away as Sheffield and Northamptonshire for exercise, while other people are unsure whether they allowed to drive five minutes down the road for a walk in their local park.</em></p>
<p><em>"A clear definition of how far we can travel for exercise would give people certainty about what they are able to do while the at the same time help us to stop the spread of this deadly virus."</em></p>

    <title>UK Government must set up Brexit Adjustment Fund</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/01/11/uk-government-must-set-up-brexit-adjustment-fund/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Chair of the International Trade Committee, Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP Angus MacNeil is writing to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak stressing the need for the UK Government to set up a Fund to assist those adversely affected by Brexit.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil is suggesting a Fund similar to the Brexit Adjustment Reserve set up by the European Union.</p>



<p>He said: “It has been long known that the worst impacted part of the whole of Europe by Brexit will be the Highlands andn Islands of Scotland.</p>



<p>“The impacts of Brexit are of course worse in the UK but there will be impacts on the European Union too obviously. There is no good Brexit, the economic story is bad for everybody.</p>



<p>“Realising this, the EU have set up a Brexit Adjustment Reserve worth about 5 billion Euros. The lion share of that is expected to go to Ireland whose economy will be impacted greatly.</p>



<p>“However, being impacted far more percentage wise will be the economy of the Highlands and Islands and perhaps most of Scotland.</p>



<p>“Therefore, I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer should set up a similar fund to what the Europeans are doing, commencing it with the economic damage Brexit is going to do to help those affected.</p>



<p>“We see already the effect on fish processors and fishermen who cannot get their catch to the valuable and lucrative market.</p>



<p>“Brexit was not the choice of Scotland but the choice of a Tory Government in a faraway Westminster.</p>



<p>“As a result, they should now ensure there is a Fund in place to compensate for the damage that they have started and continue to do as a result of the policies.</p>



<p>“If Europe can do it for the citizens of the European Union, surely the UK Government can do this for the citizens of this current Union.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;Last week Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, virtually met with Headteacher of Hornsea School and Language College, Steve Ostler, and the Chair of Governors, Graham McDonald, to congratulate Steve and find out how he and his staff successfully prepared for remote learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Prime Minister’s announcement about the new national lockdown on 4 January 2021, it was confirmed that only the children of critical workers, vulnerable children and young people who do not have access to a device should attend school or college. All other pupils and students should not attend and should receive remote learning instead. Schools are expected to provide a minimum of 3-5 hours of remote learning per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham said, “I am delighted to hear about the incredible efforts Steve Ostler and his staff have made to ensure the success of remote learning for their pupils, as well as their admirable commitment to supporting their students’ overall wellbeing. I want to congratulate Steve and his staff for taking such a positive and pragmatic approach and all the work they have done to ensure that their students’ education continues smoothly during this period of national restrictions. I am quite certain that pupils (or at least their parents) will appreciate their effort – it is hard not to be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The past year has provided us with unprecedented challenges to be met, and these clearly continue into 2021. It is great to hear about teachers and school staff working together effectively and meeting those challenges in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Headteacher, Steve Ostler, said “I really appreciate Graham’s time and interest in all the work that my staff and I have put in to ensure that our students are supported and provided with the best education that we can offer at this difficult time. I think it is really important to have these types of conversations so that schools can feedback the challenges they are experiencing, and the Government can understand what is happening on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chair of Governors, Graham McDonald, said “It was great to chat with Graham and share with him the immense efforts Steve and his staff have made to continue our students&amp;#8217; education during the new lockdown. Staff overwhelmingly decided to come into school to support the distance learning process, and we are assisting those children who need to be in school, in a safe controlled environment. The work they have done is exemplary, and they deserve every congratulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham is looking forward to working with the Headteacher and the Chair of Governors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oak Park Leisure Centre to act as Covid-19 Vaccination Hub!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/oak-park-leisure-centre-to-act-as-covid-19-vaccination-hub/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On Friday I visited Oak Park Leisure Centre as it was about to go live as one of the Covid-19 vaccination hubs in the Walsall Borough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsall Council has provided this site and combined with the local Primary Care Network and Walsall Together to create the hub for the East of the Borough.   NHS staff, GPs, Council Staff, leisure centre staff and volunteers are all working extremely hard vaccinating local residents from my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, and the organisation and logistics are incredible. I pay tribute to all those involved in making this happen.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that people want to receive their vaccinations but it is really important that as residents you wait until you are contacted by your GP practice, or the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 vaccination programme is the largest in our history, but it will ensure that we can steadily return to a more normal way of life after a year of unprecedented restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham Labour councillors call on the Government to  retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit made at the beginning of the pandemic and extend the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham. These are people that were already struggling before the pandemic and  the economic consequences of the lockdown has made life harder for them. The Government was right to help mitigate the this hardship last year with an increase  to Universal Credit payments of £20 a week. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reversing this  will hit those already most in need and result in more debt, more rent arrears and  greater reliance on food banks for many people in Nottingham. As unemployment across the country hits record highs and incomes are increasingly stretched, it is essential there is an adequate support system for those that need it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government needs to urgently reconsider its planned cut.&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Fingleton’s Simon Oates discusses the potential implications for regulated companies of the Penrose Review of UK competition policy. Is the system of regulatory appeals in the UK about to be overhauled?</p>



<p>In September last year, the prime minister asked&nbsp;<strong>John Penrose</strong>&nbsp;to examine UK competition policy with a view to identifying how it should evolve to meet the government’s policy aim of promoting a dynamic, innovation-driven economy. The ‘Penrose review’, as it is called, is timely. The country has left the European Union and at the same time is urgently exploring a route out of the economic turmoil caused by coronavirus.</p>



<p>The Penrose review is broad in scope. And there are good reasons for this. Parts of the competition regime hitherto handled by Brussels are now being handed back to the UK to manage and own, such as large mergers and state aid. According to the government,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terms-of-reference-for-john-penrose-mp-report-on-competition-policy/terms-of-reference-john-penrose-mp-report-on-competition-policy#fn:7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the scope</a>&nbsp;of the review will include antitrust and consumer protection policy, including tackling consumer rip-offs, bad business practices, and “supporting disruptors taking risks on new ideas”.</p>



<p>The review will also consider reform ideas advanced by outgoing Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) chairman Lord Andrew Tyrie, set out in his&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/781151/Letter_from_Andrew_Tyrie_to_the_Secretary_of_State_BEIS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter to then BEIS secretary Greg Clark</a>&nbsp;in February 2019.</p>



<p>One eye-catching – and potentially controversial – suggestion in Lord Tyrie’s letter is his statement that, “there is a strong case for removing review of economic regulatory decisions from the CMA. These could be consolidated in the Courts … this would simplify appeal arrangements across the regulatory landscape.”</p>



<p>This statement signals a major change to the way appeals could work. It suggests a removal of the current right to a “merit based review” of sector regulator’s decisions by the CMA – which exists in one form or another across most regulated sectors. His suggestion is to establish an alternative process where appeal cases would go straight to the Courts on judicial review grounds.</p>



<p>Is there justification for such a radical move, should regulated businesses and their investors care about such changes, and if so what can they do?</p>



<p>Today’s regulatory environment</p>



<p>UK regulators are responsible for setting the allowed: revenues, level of returns, and the scale and scope of investment for companies of considerable size and value. Critical pipes and infrastructure businesses – water, energy, and telecoms – alone represent over £35 billion of annual revenues. If we add in the revenues of other major UK regulated businesses, Royal Mail, NATS, Heathrow Airport and Network Rail, the combined annual turnover rises to more than £50 billion.</p>



<p>With the oversight of such significant economic activity vested in the hands of non-elected institutions, it’s essential that sector regulators are held accountable for their decisions through a range of clear and robust processes. At present, a range of methods combine to provide accountability, including:</p>



<ul><li>•Corporate Governance requirements (notably: Boards with Independent Chairs / Non-Executives)</li><li>•Consumer representation (for example via statutory consumer bodies such as Citizens Advice Bureaux and Consumer Council for Water)</li><li>•Transparency arrangements (notably: a statutory requirement to consult on licence modifications)</li><li>•The ability for regulated companies to request references to the CMA / CAT for merits based review / appeals of major regulatory decisions (e.g. licence changes such as price reviews)</li><li>•Judicial Review</li><li>•Parliamentary Scrutiny via Select Committees</li></ul>



<p>Two things leap out from this list. The first is that the only way a sector regulator’s decision can be reviewed – and potentially removed and replaced by an alternative outcome – is by reference to the CMA. Whilst the other processes provide strong incentives for high quality decision making, reference to the CMA is the only means by which the regulator’s final decision can be subjected to a merits based review – an assessment of whether the decision was ‘right and preferable’ based on evidence which supports a high quality decision.</p>



<p>The second is that, whilst most accountability measures are applied consistently, the approach to a merits based review varies significantly from sector to sector. This may explain Lord Tyrie’s call to simplify appeal arrangements across regulated sectors.</p>



<p>The table below summarises the current landscape (merits based reviews and appeals):</p>



<p>Is there a case for change?</p>



<p>The variation across sectors (illustrated in the table above) means that there are material differences in the detail of how each sector regulator is held accountable for the quality of their decisions.</p>



<p>These sector specific differences are largely a relic of history. Each one linked to the stage of maturity of their industry – when their sector specific legislation was established. The variation is not driven by any specific rationale, such as sector specific needs.</p>



<p>The Penrose review provides an ideal opportunity to re-evaluate the regulatory appeals framework and the CMA’s role within it. Full harmonisation across all sectors may not be desirable, but a fresh assessment of whether the existing differences across sectors remain appropriate – targeting simplification where possible – would provide welcome clarity for regulated businesses.</p>



<p>What also seems clear is that any dilution in regulatory accountability, specifically the removal of a merits based review of decisions by an independent body, is unlikely to be the right answer. Any move to do so should be troubling to regulated businesses, their investors, and also the boards of independent sector regulators who value their credibility.</p>



<p>History shows regulators don’t always get it right the first time. There are many examples over the last two decades of sector regulators decisions being referred to the CMA, (or its predecessors the CC or MMC) and of errors being identified as part of the merits based review. Sometimes in the favour of companies, sometimes customers.</p>



<p>This year has been no different on that front. In February 2020, four water companies disputed their regulator’s, decision relating to the price review settlement, seeking a redetermination at the CMA. At the time of writing, the CMA, in its provisional findings, found some aspects of Ofwat’s decisions wanting. The CMA is currently consulting on upping the rate of allowed return for the water companies 0.54bps above Ofwat’s original figure as well as allowing each company a higher expenditure allowance (on average about 15 per cent above Ofwat’s settlement). Without scope for a merits based review, a judicial review would be the only basis for appeal. And, the courts are limited in scope. They can only consider if the method by which a regulator took a decision was robust, not if the regulator was correct. Simply put, moving away from a merits based review process would leave companies unable to seek a review of whether the level of allowed return or expenditure allowances had been set at the right level, by their regulator, to underpin financeability.</p>



<p>Adopting a judicial review process is not just a bold move, it could hurt businesses, industries and consumers. Further still, it could undermine the accountability of independent regulators as well as trust in the sectors they oversee. All of which is problematic as the UK seeks to attract investment in critical infrastructure, the government charts a path to economic recovery following the Covid pandemic and seeks to tackle the major societal challenges to achieve net zero.</p>



<p>So what should happen?</p>



<p>We need sector regulators to continue to be accountable and we need a framework to make this happen. Any changes to the system must avoid dilution of accountability. A move away from a merits based review of regulators’ decisions would be a clear dilution.</p>



<p>Our hope is that Penrose will take this opportunity to provide businesses with additional clarity, and propose a harmonised appeal process across the industry sectors.</p>



<p>What this appeals process looks like in practice is not a decision to be taken lightly. The CMA has the central role in ensuring consumers get a good deal when buying goods and services, and that businesses operate within the law. We know that its primary focus is to investigate mergers and entire markets, to take action against businesses and individuals involved in cartels or anti-competitive behaviour, and to protect consumers from unfair trading practices. But come January 2021, its plate will be full, as the effects of Brexit start to bite. Inclusion in its remit to act as an appellate body for sector regulators price review decisions does seem an odd bed fellow in this context.</p>



<p>And, removing the review of sector regulators’ price review decisions from CMA’s remit would clarify its role as a decision taker rather than appellate body. What then for merits based review of regulator’s decisions? One option would be to channel them to the Competition Appeal Tribunal – a body which is well-versed in appeals based on the merits (the clue’s in the name).</p>



<p>Penrose’s report is expected this month and regulated companies and their investors are watching closely. At this stage, the Penrose review has not explicitly gone out to consultation or asked for responses from industry. Instead, it has opted to speak directly to deemed experts to gather views and insight. This does not stop a concerned company or its investors from writing to the review team to express their views, make their voice heard and help shape their regulatory future.</p>

    <title>The benefits of taking back control</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The establishment media has been concentrating on the Dover Calais route and expressing concern that there were no lorry queues  there on our first Brexit days. Where were all the programmes to look at our options now we are free?   The BBC , ever willing to interview me when they thought Brexit was in danger, wanted no statements from me of all the things we can now do as an independent country.</p>



<p> So let me have another go at reminding them what they are missing, and how they are failing to inform their viewers and listeners.</p>



<p>We take back control of our taxes. The Tampon tax goes, and I want to see the back of the taxes on green products from boiler controls to insulation, from heat pumps to draught excluder. Why did the Remain media defend these taxes?</p>



<p>We take back control of our farms. We can now offer grants and loans to promote more British food to  high standards. cutting the food miles. We need to win back lost market share in everything from pig meat to flowers and from salad crops to dairy. We can now ban live exports of animals and raise our welfare standards by so doing. </p>



<p>We take back control of our trade policy. We can now hope to join the mighty Trans Pacific partnership of large and growing economies and move through that to a US trade treaty, denied to us during 48 years in the EU running our trade policy.</p>



<p>We can take back control of our fishing grounds. Immediately the government will ban pulse fishing which damages our fish stocks and marine environment. There now needs to be a big move to expand capacity of our fishing fleet ready for our full control at the end of a further transition period. We also need to attract more food processing and fish freezing businesses to support the trawlers.</p>



<p>We can take back control of our industrial grants and subsidy regimes. All too often in the EU they used grants and subsidies to divert investment away from the UK or even to achieve closure of a UK factory to be replaced by a facility elsewhere. Now we can spend our money wisely on helping rebuild lost manufacturing.</p>



<p>We can take back control of our Freeport and Enterprise Zone policy, creating many more around the UK as part of the levelling up drive without falling foul of EU rules.</p>



<p>We can as a nation resume our rightful place on world bodies, with our own vote and voice to be a force for the good, for peace, prosperity and democracy.</p>

After an initial closure period which lasted until November 2020, libraries have been open for the collection and return of books and pre-booked essential computer/internet access.</p>
              <p>Late fees are to remain suspended.</p>
              <p><strong>Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> “I think in light of the current situation across east London this is the right move. Every necessary step should be taken to combat the virus until vaccines can be effectively delivered on mass. Many of the library services that are cherished by residents can still be accessed online through ebooks, audiobooks and events.”</p>
              <p>The library service is still delivering a number of online events to keep communities connected throughout the national lockdown, and details can be found on the website here: <strong><a href="https://www.havering.gov.uk/events/20039/libraries">https://www.havering.gov.uk/events/20039/libraries</a></strong></p>
              <p>Residents can also find out more details about services via email: <a href="mailto:alexis.wainwright@havering.gov.uk">alexis.wainwright@havering.gov.uk</a></p>

        <p>From this week, the Government are introducing new national lockdown measures<span><strong>. </strong>I know how frustrating and disheartening this news will be after an incredibly challenging year, b</span>ut these restrictions are necessary to save lives and to prevent our NHS from becoming overwhelmed. We’ve seen alarming increases in cases in recent weeks, with rates of infection and hospitalisation now rising extremely quickly in every region of the UK. The new variant of the virus is 50% to 70% more infectious and transmissible. Hundreds of people are losing their lives on a daily basis. Every day without decisive action means more will die and our hospitals will be unable to care for those who are desperately ill. It’s devastating for families and businesses to start the New Year with tighter restrictions – but this is the only way we will save lives; protect our NHS; and get through the toughest winter we have ever faced.</p>

    <title>Public Health Debate – Covid Restrictions 06/01/21</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2021/01/08/public-health/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This week I participated in the Public Health debate concerning the implementation of new Covid restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the third wave of Covid intensifies and we are back under lockdown, it is critical the UK Government agree to a &amp;#8216;Zero Tolerance&amp;#8217; approach to community transmission, as sought last summer by the three Devolved Governments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also crucial that the UK Government restrict international travel both too and from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only by following such a strict approach will our domestic economy and society eventually be able to open up fully and safely as we have seen in countries like New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The impact of new restrictions will be tough on families and businesses who will need financial support to get through it and so it was hugely disappointing to hear that the £375 million of support for businesses in Scotland promised by the Chancellor has since been rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can watch my full contribution to the public health debate here: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx8FeTZmkk"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx8FeTZmkk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="06/02 Public Health Debate" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Qx8FeTZmkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Dr Philippa Whitford MP&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, when the SARS-Cov-2 virus emerged, there was no handbook on covid. All Governments had to feel their way, but there is little excuse for repeating the same mistakes a year on. “Go early and go hard” has been public health experts’ consistent advice. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organisation said at the start of the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet just last week, the Health Secretary still refused to put England into tier 4, despite surging case numbers and the devolved nations already being under tight restrictions since Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the late lockdown in March and rushed reopening in May, the Government allowed rates of infection in England to run seven times higher than in Scotland or Northern Ireland over the summer, and at the time, chose not to agree a zero-tolerance covid policy to eliminate community spread of the virus on a UK-wide basis. The gains of lockdown were gradually lost, as eat out to help out drove up cases in August and September, thus beginning the second wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK is one of the few countries that never closed its borders and many new strains of covid were imported by people travelling to Europe on summer holidays.&amp;nbsp;Even now, in the middle of the second wave, the UK does not have strict testing and residential or monitored quarantine for arrivals. On the contrary, the Government have sought to grant further exemptions from quarantine rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the Prime Minister ignored the tenfold rise in covid cases and his own advisory group to listen yet again to the proponents of disease-driven rather than vaccine-based herd immunity, leading to a six-week delay in instigating the autumn lockdown. Herd immunity can be safely achieved only through the use of a vaccine, and even then, only if the vaccine prevents transmission of the virus and thus also protects the unvaccinated. That is the hope, but we do not yet know if either of the vaccines used in the UK will achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understandable that Governments are wary about the use of tight covid restrictions and their impact on our economy and society, but it is a false dichotomy to set public health against the economy and lives against livelihoods. People simply choose not to endanger themselves or their families and need to have confidence that the risk of catching the virus is very low. Allowing increased levels of spread—and, therefore, high rates of viral replication—also contributes to more frequent mutations, and increases the risk of generating yet more problematic new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases growing exponentially, it simply is not possible to vaccinate our way out of the current surge so I welcome the decision for this lockdown, but it is tough on everyone, and both individuals and businesses will need support to get through it. That is why it is bitterly disappointing to hear that the £375 million of support for businesses in Scotland promised by the Chancellor just yesterday has now been rescinded, leaving Scotland with no new funding to deal with the economic impact of the current shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government must also consider what strategy they will follow at the end of the lockdown. It should be maintained long enough to achieve suppression of community transmission and to establish a more systematic approach to test, trace and isolate. It is critical to provide both financial and practical support to those who need to isolate, as it is only isolation that actually breaks the chains of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict controls at external borders would avoid importing more covid cases and new variants. Such a covid-secure approach would allow the domestic UK economy to reopen fully, with the Government then able to target financial support at the industries associated with international travel, such as aviation and aerospace, which have been so badly impacted by the pandemic. Countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Korea, which have tight travel restrictions and quarantines, have eliminated community transmission and been able fully to open up their economies and societies, including schools, hospitality and domestic tourism. We only have to look at their Christmas and new year celebrations to see what could be on offer to us here if we get things right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“It is vitally important that we follow lockdown rules to stop the spread of this virus” – Karin Smyth MP</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Local MP, Karin Smyth, is encouraging all constituents to follow the rules laid down by the Government this week in order to protect those vulnerable to this virus and to support the work of NHS staff. This comes after the UK Government finally acted upon the SAGE documents published before Christmas.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Government has now implemented a national lockdown in England, and everyone must now stay at home to try to slow the spread of the virus; that means, working from home where possible and only go out for essential reasons: to shop for basic necessities, to exercise, to seek or provide medical assistance, and to attend education for those eligible. Most children and university students will now learn remotely until February half term.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For greater detail on the rules and exceptions, check the UK Government website at: <a href="http://gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609947550551000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLiV7obsfUO_K8WoTzkvmzXLrfJQ">gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Karin Smyth MP said:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“2020 was an incredibly difficult year for many and this was not the start we wanted to the New Year, but the third lockdown announced this week is vital to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to protect those most at risk from this virus. It’s important that we all act quickly on Government advice as we need to make up for time lost through dither and delay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The vaccine is being rolled out, but until sufficient numbers have been vaccinated, we need to continue to pull together and protect our family and friends, and all those we come into contact with. I know it’s difficult, that we all miss seeing those we love, and that we are weary of the frequently changing rules, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, and we must not stop now.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Support for constituents can be found on the Bristol Council website at <a href="https://www.bristol.gov.uk/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bristol.gov.uk/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609947550551000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnuP4YCjbRT0MAvCOYX50KuJjtJw">https://www.bristol.gov.uk/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know</a> and from the local Citizens Advice Bureau at <a href="http://bristolcab.org.uk/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bristolcab.org.uk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609947550551000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKa93gq4aVSLQZwsamnHRlO8xtHQ">bristolcab.org.uk</a> or on the phone at 0808 278 7957.</p>

    <title>The UK’s future relationship with the EU</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/the-uks-future-relationship-with-the-eu/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p class="xmsonormal">On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister heralded the deal his negotiators had struck with European Union counterparts concerning our future relationship with our nearest neighbours and the largest trading bloc in the world. After running a General Election over a year ago to ‘Get Brexit Done’ and boasting he had an ‘oven-ready deal’, he seemed incapable of delivering this ‘gas mark 4, 20 minutes’ deal for the country until the last possible moment. Why is that?</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Well some, including the Government, have blamed the European Union. But I believe, this is all about the Government playing politics. It was clear where they were heading several weeks ago, and I predicted that just before Christmas, the Prime Minister would strike a deal and claim to have saved the day.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The theatrics, posturing and even the insincerity in how some politicians and their acolytes chose to behave is, for me, the worst aspect of what should be a noble profession. Instead this disingenuous, calculated game-playing demeans the role of MPs, and certainly discredits the title of honourable, let alone right honourable, members.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The fact that the Prime Minister had already signed the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement before the EU (Future Relationship) Bill had been voted on by MPs, makes an absolute mockery of Brexit being about taking back control and Parliamentary sovereignty. It is an appalling charade.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">But what about the Agreement itself? I think describing this deal as ‘thin’ is being kind to say the least. It is true it is better than no deal but there are many omissions, for example, on financial services which accounts for 80% of the UK economy, and there are many shortfalls, not least the aspect of the deal on fisheries.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The Agreement consists of three pillars: a trade agreement, collaboration on security and governance arrangements. The trade agreement provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods as long as UK goods have the same standards as the EU; however, that does not mean there are no costs to businesses.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">There will be costs associated with SPS checks, customs formalities and in establishing the rules of origin of UK goods. As mentioned above there is no financial services passport and professional qualifications from the UK will not be recognised. And although we no longer have access to most EU programmes, our experience this year with managing the Covid pandemic has made some in the Government realise the importance of co-operation with EU countries in life sciences research; as such the deal retains participation in Horizon Europe for the next few years, subject to the UK’s financial contribution.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">There are new security arrangements with the EU as we lose access to the European Arrest Warrant, but these are subject to the retention and implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights. And where either the UK or EU disagree with the interpretation or implementation of this new Agreement a soon-to-be-established (at what costs one wonders) Joint Partnership Council will seek to pass judgement on the dispute.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">But fear not! Our post-Covid holiday plans to Europe won’t be affected. We will be able to travel to EU countries for up to 90 days without a visa, but unfortunately our pets won’t. And there’s no protection from mobile phone roaming charges being re-introduced.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The reciprocal rights of EU and UK citizens, and peace and stability on the island of Ireland are still protected under the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland within this.</p>
<p><span style="color: black;">The new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement took effect on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2021. And as the European Commission states:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt;"><em><span style="color: black;">‘On that date, the UK will leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union, as well as all EU policies and international agreements. The free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the UK and the EU will end.</span></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt;"><em><span style="color: black;">The EU and the UK will form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist today.’</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">It is difficult to do justice to the tens of thousands of pages that have been written about Brexit and what will happen now in a few hundred words. This deal is the result of what most British people said they voted for back in 2016, and what many people told me that they wanted last year when I campaigned during the General Election. I hope they’re right. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">But I fear that there will be many detrimental impacts resulting from this appalling deal, some of which may not emerge for months or even years. I hope I am wrong. So, I am putting you on notice, Mr Johnson, I will hold you to account for every empty promise that you have made, for the inequality that you say you can now vanquish and the ‘levelling up’ across our country that you claim can only now happen. I’m not going to let you get away with any more lies.   </span></p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus &#8211; support for local businesses &amp; high streets:</span></strong></p>
<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>
<p>I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement of the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of April 2021, and the extension of the business loan schemes until the end of March. You can find more information on the support and grants available for you or your business <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Christmas cheer for the Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/christmas-cheer-for-the-friends-of-neath-abbey-iron-company/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Hard-working volunteers with the Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company have pulled another iron from the fund-raising fire – a £9,300 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to take the project to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Part of the cash will be used to create a digital guide to the history of Neath Abbey – including not only the world-famous ironworks but the impressive remains of the Cistercian monastery close by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;And with open days, guided tours and personal presentations all off-limits while the corona virus pandemic continues, digital outreach has become an essential tool in raising awareness of the project by allowing people to visualise the ironworks at its world-beating peak – when it powered the industrial revolution of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Data will be posted on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and People’s Collection Wales, creating a virtual guided tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;In addition, new interpretive panels at the ironworks will explain the history and function of the various structures and buildings on site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;The remainder of the money will be used to renovate an old BT telephone kiosk – which cost £1 – and convert it into a heritage centre at the nearby Longford housing estate where local people can, via a display book and works of art, discover the area’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;The artworks will be created by children of the local Dwr y Felin Comprehensive School. Other community groups such as Bryncoch Environment Group, Dyffryn Clydach Community Council, Dyffryn Clydach and Bryncoch Historic Group will also display community news, events and information in the kiosk.&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2344"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2344" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8DCDF1DF-42F0-4CD0-97E0-3676E4E7186B-560x297.png" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>2020 has left us with many legacies as we’ve coped with a set of circumstances none of us would have imagined. As we look to the light provided by new vaccines and as we approach a new year, there is yet another nasty legacy sting in the tail of 2020 – a rise in feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p>Research from Age UK has shown that this Christmas is set to be the loneliest yet for older people. Over 160,000 people over the age of 65 will suffer from feeling lonely this festive season, with nearly 60% of them fearing that they won’t see any family and friends. Those are heartbreaking numbers, even one person feeling like this is one too many.</p>
<p>Our communities can carry another more positive legacy from 2020. The Age UK research also highlighted that over 100,000 older people were helped to get through the pandemic by the kindness of strangers. The simple act of checking on people made a life-enhancing difference for so many, we can never know for sure, but it’s probably safe to assume that in some instances, it was life-saving.</p>
<p>Of course, loneliness and isolation don’t discriminate; young people are also affected. The Office of National statistics were able to point out that, during the first month of the pandemic, 7. 4 million people, across the nations of the UK said that their wellbeing was affected through feeling isolated.</p>
<p>We all knew that these restrictions were essential to protect lives, but the collateral effect was, as predicted, substantial. Recently, we have become more aware of a problem that has existed for some time but rarely brought into public debate. Work undertaken for the charities MIND and Mental Health UK confirmed that young people are particularly affected by loneliness.</p>
<p>During the pandemic almost half of 18-24-year-olds experienced, and those aged 25-34 are twice – yes twice – as likely to be lonely at Christmas than older people. That’s a lot of lonely people out there feeling isolated.</p>
<p>While we cannot visit indoors, there are many other ways we can help people feel less isolated. Given that a third of people are too embarrassed to admit that they are lonely, it is small acts that make a difference; it might be a note through the door or a phone call to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. Simple offers of contact, help with shopping, a chat a few steps back from the doorstep could mean a big deal to reassure folk that they are valued and to feel a little less alone.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

					&lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&amp;nbsp;UK&amp;nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video was produced during the visit, which can be viewed below:&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith tells Government ‘the people of the north will hold you to account’ on rebalancing the economy.</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I took part in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DanJarvisMP&lt;/a&gt; debate on support for the economy in the North. We need a fundamental rebalancing of our economy after Covid. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this Government to account for their promises and their actions. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCcp6jNBhp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCcp6jNBhp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judith Cummins (@JudithCummins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudithCummins/status/1326541226452004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
