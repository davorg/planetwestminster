&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has sounded the alarm over vast scale of cuts to youth services under the Tories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New analysis by the House of Commons Library reveals that average spending per 16-24-year-old in the North West has fallen from £130.3 million in 2011/12 to just £42.99 in 2018/19 – down 64.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average spending per 16-24-year-old in England has fallen from £142 in 2011/12 to just £56 in 2018/19 – down 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Midlands, North East, North West, and Yorkshire &amp;amp; the Humber have seen the biggest falls in spending per young person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis reveals that while the least deprived areas saw spending fall by just over half, in the most deprived areas it fell by two thirds – above the average for the country as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour are warning that the Conservatives are set to break their manifesto promise to fund youth services, failing a generation of young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour have called on the Government to stick to their manifesto pledge to provide £500 million to youth services by April 2020, and deliver this critical fund to prevent yet more youth centres being forced to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Youth services are such an important lifeline for young people, especially for those living in areas of deprivation, but under the Tories we&amp;#8217;ve seen hundreds of youth centres closing in every region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over a year ago the Conservatives promised to introduce the Youth Investment Fund to support youth services. Yet not one penny has materialised. Covid-19 has only worsened the perilous state youth services were already in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whilst the Tories keep breaking their promises to young people, we are seeing a generation being let down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span>South Shropshire MP, Philip Dunne, has welcomed the Spending Review which provides billions of pounds in the fight against coronavirus, delivers on the manifesto promises made to the British people and invests in the UK’s recovery.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Today the Chancellor set out an ambitious plan that focuses on levelling up across the country, investing in vital infrastructure that will ensure the UK builds back better from coronavirus.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>As part of the Government’s commitments to fund the nation’s priorities, the Spending Review confirmed: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ol><li><span><span><span>A further £55 billion to help with the UK’s response to coronavirus – including £18 billion for mass testing, Test and Trace, PPE and vaccines, and £3 billion to support NHS recovery.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li><span><span><span>A funding boost for the NHS. Next year, the health budget will grow by £6.6 billion, helping to deliver the pre-election pledge for 50,000 more nurses and 50 million more GP appointments. The government is investing in new technologies, building 40 new hospitals, upgrading 70 more, including in Shrewsbury and Telford, and replacing the vast majority of ageing diagnostic equipment.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li><span><span><span>More money for schools, meaning every pupil in the country will see a year-on-year funding increase of at least 2 per cent. The Government is also funding its commitment to rebuild 500 schools over the next decade and providing £375 million to deliver the Prime Minister’s Lifetime Skills Guarantee.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="4"><li><span><span><span>£400 million to recruit 6,000 new police officers – on track to meet the manifesto pledge to recruit 20,000 more police officers by 2023.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="5"><li><span><span><span>More than £24 billion investment in defence – the biggest sustained increase in 30 years – improving security and capability not just for our country but around the world.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="6"><li><span><span><span>An increase in core spending power for local authorities by an estimated 4.5 per cent, along with over £3 billion of additional coronavirus support and an extra £254 million of funding to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="7"><li><span><span><span>Capital spending of £100 billion next year, meaning vital investment in roads, rail, hospitals, schools, broadband and housing. </span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="8"><li><span><span><span>A new Levelling Up Fund, worth £4 billion in England and £800 million in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to build the infrastructure of everyday life.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="9"><li><span><span><span>A new National Infrastructure Strategy, and a new UK infrastructure bank - headquartered in the north of England - to work with the private sector to finance major new investment projects across the UK.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><ol start="10"><li><span><span><span>Support for every country across the United Kingdom, increasing Scottish Government funding by £2.4 billion, Welsh Government funding by £1.3 billion, and £900 million for the Northern Ireland Executive.</span></span></span></li>
</ol><p><span><span><strong><span><span>Mr Dunne said: </span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The context in which the Chancellor has had to construct a fair, responsible and balanced Spending Review was stark – with the largest fall in economic output in 300 years. But today’s funding announcements have been focussed not only on the response to coronavirus – where next year departments will receive an additional £55bn to respond to coronavirus, following this year’s support of £280bn. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>I also welcome plans to increase the National Living Wage to £8.91 an hour, a 2.2% increase, following the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission, and ensuring those public sector workers earning less than the median, will receive a pay increase of at least £250. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>I welcome the call for projects as we move to the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, and the new £4bn Levelling Up Fund, for which I shall be encouraging projects in South Shropshire to come forward.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak MP said:</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Today’s Spending Review delivers the priorities of the British people. Our health emergency is not yet over, and the economic emergency has only just begun; so our immediate priority is to protect people’s lives and livelihoods. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“But today’s Spending Review also delivers stronger public services - paying for new hospitals, better schools and safer streets. And it delivers a once-in-a-generation transformation in our approach to infrastructure. Creating jobs, growing the economy, and increasing pride in the places people call home.”</span></span></span></span></p></div>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://dominicraab.com/2020/11/25/new-coronavirus-testing-site-in-hersham/"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I was encouraged to receive a letter from the Department of Health and Social Care, informing me that a new Coronavirus testing site will soon be opening at Hersham Village Hall. This is good news for the community, as it will make it easier to access tests and tackle the virus.</p>
<p>The new testing site is part of an expansion of ‘walk-through’ sites across the UK, complementing the existing drive-through testing network, home testing and the Mobile Testing Units which have been travelling across the country. This will help the NHS Test and Trace service (which has processed more than 38 million tests since the pandemic began) to expand testing even further.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that anybody with Coronavirus symptoms can get a test. So, if you are experiencing a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste, you can book a test at nhs.uk/coronavirus, by calling 119, or by using the NHS Covid-19 app. You will be told where the nearest testing site is and have the option to order a home testing kit if you cannot reach a testing site.</p>
<p>Of course, you and anyone you live with must self-isolate as soon as you develop symptoms. If you are working and receiving benefits, you may be eligible for a £500 payment to support you during the period of self-isolation. More information on this is available <a href="https://www.elmbridge.gov.uk/news/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/test-and-trace-support-payments/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Local residents have continued to show great resolve in recent weeks. While the winter months will be tough, I encourage everyone to keep up the good work, sticking to the rules and keeping each other safe.</p>

    <title>Letter from Cllr David Mellen to the PM on COVID Tiers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2020/11/25/letter-from-cllr-david-mellen-to-the-pm-on-covid-tiers/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;Cllr David Mellen&lt;br&gt;Leader, Nottingham City Council&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Tim also warned that large scale reorganisation would be a major distraction for those in charge of looking after education, social care and economic recovery in Cumbria.</p>
<p>Speaking during a debate in Westminster Hall, Tim said: <em>"Even if you thought there was some wisdom in changing the balance of local government in Cumbria, how crackers, how out of touch would you have to be to think that now is the moment to do it.</em></p>
<p><em>"So I would say to the minister do not distract our social care home managers, our carers, our teachers, those people caring for the homeless, those people leading the economic recovery, do not divert them from their vital task by a pointless act of navel contemplation - a top down reorganisation."</em></p>
<p>Responding, the Minister for Regional Growth and Local Government Luke Hall said: <em>"He has passionate views about local government reform and the timings of it.</em></p>
<p><em>"Of course, he will absolutely be able to make that argument through the process in the right way, and I know he feels extremely strongly about that matter."</em></p>

    <title>MP calls for local Covid testing for offshore workers to avoid unnecessary travel</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2020/11/24/mp-calls-for-local-covid-testing-for-offshore-workers-to-avoid-unnecessary-travel/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MP calls for local Covid testing for offshore workers to avoid unnecessary travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP, Angus MacNeil has written to Jeanne Freeman MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Health regarding offshore workers who require to take a Covid-19 test prior to returning to work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many islanders are employed across the world working offshore and their employers are routinely asking their staff to be tested prior to returning to their place of work. &amp;nbsp;NHS Western Isles will only test people with Covid symptoms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NHS Western Isles will only test people who show Covid symptoms and this means that workers are having to make needless journeys during this pandemic to all corners of Scotland to get a Covid test,&amp;nbsp;potentially exposing themselves&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the risk of catching the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These workers are getting tested at their own or employers’ expense and I know that there is capacity available in the Western Isles to carry out these tests.&amp;nbsp;I have suggested to the Health Secretary that perhaps some arrangement could be reached that would be satisfactory to the companies, the staff and to the Scottish Government that would end the needless and risky travel across Scotland.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At a time of travel restrictions it seems counter-productive to expect people to do additional travelling to get a Covid test.&amp;nbsp; I would say the solution would be to enable NHS Western Isles to&amp;nbsp;test these workers&amp;nbsp;and a financial arrangement probably&amp;nbsp;entered into.&amp;nbsp;This would benefit the workers, employers and particularly public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I  have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade  agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update: </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and </span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211; positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a> and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-34/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I want to send my huge congratulations to staff and students at Ysgol Hendrefelin this week for their accreditation with the prestigious British Council’s International School Award. This award recognises the incredible and innovative work of schools across the UK to connect their pupils to the world through modern languages, classroom exchanges, and connections with young people around the globe. Learning languages is so important – it gives us access to new cultures and ideas and allows us to broaden our understanding of the world.  Well done Ysgol Hendrefelin.</p>
<p>I was pleased to chair a debate in Westminster Hall this week on fuel poverty. This always becomes an issue in the lead up to winter, but this year, there will be an added strain on so many tightened household budgets. One of the major obstacles in tackling fuel poverty is the inefficient nature of our older housing. Poorly insulated properties leak heat and so more energy is needed to keep the house warm. As well as supporting those in fuel poverty in the short-term, we really need a national strategy to not only ensure developers are building energy efficient homes, but also that we are supporting homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient. This will not only contribute to lower household bills, but it will also help us reduce our carbon footprint.  This is an important issue that intersects the economy, social inequality, and the environment, and one which it is vital that we tackle.</p>
<p>This week is Usdaw’s annual Respect for Shopworkers Week which they run as part of their Freedom From Fear campaign which seeks to tackle the rising problem of violence and abuse towards our fabulous frontline retail workers. Our shopworkers have done so much to keep us well stocked and our morale high during this crisis and I am shocked to see the appalling treatment that many of them have experienced. I am pleased to support this campaign and would encourage all constituents to sign <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/328621">Usdaw’s petition</a> to call on the UK Government to enact legislation to create a specific offence of abusing, threatening, or assaulting a retail worker with a penalty that shows that we are serious about stopping these disgusting attacks.</p>
<p>It’s Anti-Bullying Week this week and it’s important to support the campaign. Bullying can have a long-lasting effect on those who experience and witness it, but by working together, by sharing our experiences, and by educating young people, we can reduce bullying. We all have a part to play – parents, teachers, politicians, celebrities, and young people themselves – we can all speak out against bullying and speak up for those experiencing it.</p>
<p>We marked International Men’s Day this week and it’s a chance to make sure men know that reaching out for help with a physical or mental health problem is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength. In 2017, sadly 12,031 men died from prostate cancer, a rise from 11,307 in 2014. It is so important that men go to their GP when something doesn’t seem right – if problems are caught earlier, they are much easier to deal with. In 2018, it is astonishing that 4,903 men took their own lives – that’s 13 men dying every day, making up 3 in 4 of all suicides in the UK. We need to talk more about men’s mental health and make it clear that there is help available for men. Domestic abuse is another area where men have suffered, and evidence shows 1 in 3 people who experience domestic abuse are men.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my work as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

        <p>The Coronavirus pandemic has hit Barnsley and South Yorkshire hard. We’ve seen worryingly high rates of infection, hospitalisation and residents losing their lives. Our regional economy has been ravaged. The level of people claiming unemployment-related benefits is now higher than any time since the mid-1990s when we were still in the aftermath of the pit closures. As I set out in the debate I led in Parliament last week, the brutal reality is that the North is now on course for levelling down, not levelling up. However, we have the raw materials at our fingertips to create a better economy, not just for our region, but for the whole of the UK.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>As we approach the halfway point of the Government’s nationwide lockdown, I want to thank constituents and businesses for abiding by the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The Government has lost control of the virus, and my first duty is to keep my constituents safe. That is why I voted for the lockdown. Nobody voted for the regulations with anything but a heavy heart. I did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>This period must be used to undertake the transfer of test and trace to local public health departments, including a full resource transfer. In addition, the Government must ensure that the NHS and social care are fully prepared with adequate PPE, as high as possible uptake of flu vaccinations and regular testing regimes.</p>
<p>I have proposed measures to protect the clinically vulnerable and providing ‘supportive shielding’ so that people don’t experience the devastating isolation that happened last time. We must also make sure we have simple, coherent messaging with local community engagement as well as monitoring and enforcement capacity to support people complying during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Local restrictions have had a devastating effect on people living in care homes and their families.  As co-Chair of the APPG on Dementia I have received heart-breaking stories from Oldhamers, unable to visit their loved ones for months on end, and who have seen a marked deterioration in their condition, particularly for those living with dementia.</p>
<p>I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the impact of coronavirus on people living with dementia, their families and carers last week, where I challenged the Minister on these issues. I pressed the Minister to report back to Parliament on her trial of visitor testing which starts on 16<sup>th</sup> November in 30 care homes, with the intention of rolling out testing for visitors across the country in December.  It is essential that family members are able to safely visit their loved ones in care homes, especially as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>I have also been challenging the Government on how they’ve been awarding Covid-related contracts. Billions of pounds of public money has been awarded to private companies often with no experience in delivering medical supplies. The Government’s repeated refusal to come clean about where this public money has left no option but to compel the Government to come clean through the courts. This is why I partnered with Caroline Lucas MP, Layla Moran MP and the Good Law Project in legal action to force the Government to publish details of private covid and PPE related contracts.</p>
<p>Whilst we recognise that at the beginning of the pandemic we needed to move quickly, this does not justify the Government’s wholesale disregard for transparency including the publication of contracts awarded. The Government has now disclosed that at least £17 billion worth of Covid-19 contracts have been awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care since April, with over £4 billion of these contracts being hidden. The transparency gap is therefore growing.</p>
<p>I am pleased that last week the High Court granted our judicial review to challenge the Government’s persistent failure to publish these contracts. The hearing is scheduled for mid-January 2021 and I’ll keep you informed of our progress.</p>
<p>Do look after yourselves and stay safe.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color"&gt;Earlier this month I was delighted to be personally invited by renowned businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist, John Mills to join the advisory board of his new Institute for Prosperity recently. The nine person advisory board is made up of a group of cross-party MPs, former MPs and Peers. All of whom have Ministerial or Shadow Ministerial experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Institute was set up earlier this year by Mr Mills who is also the founder and Chairman of South Shields based consumer goods company JML, which sells high-volume consumer products in the UK and 85 countries worldwide.&amp;nbsp;The Institute’s aim is to increase prosperity, growth and equality by putting a more successful economic future at the heart of British political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Shields, like many towns across the country have been decimated by lack of investment and deindustrialisation and many have been forgotten by successive governments. Growing up I watched this powerful and prosperous industrious town slowly wither and as a result 100’s of skilled jobs, like that of my fathers disappeared too along with much needed investment. So, I am delighted to work alongside John and parliamentary colleagues to do all we can to find a consensus, to provide a platform to bring people with fresh ideas together and to find new solutions to Britain’s economic problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, has met with the Chair of the Humber County Priory Group for St John Ambulance to discuss how the charity has worked to support the NHS throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The meeting also comes after news that St John Ambulance is to close its Morton Lane base in Beverley, following a coronavirus-catalysed review of the charity’s estate. Of the 352 buildings owned or leased by St John Ambulance, 117 have been earmarked for closure. While this represents the majority of properties that will close, a further review will be carried out in the autumn.</p>
<p>However, the charity has sought to make it clear that the closure of buildings does not mean the closure of local units – instead increasing their use of technology to grow volunteer numbers and expand its units, as well as using more hired premises.</p>
<p>The outbreak of coronavirus has seen St John Ambulance undertake its most significant mobilisation of volunteers in peacetime, as it has moved to support the NHS response. Its volunteers have collectively spent over 200,000 hours providing care to patients, helping to protect the nation’s health.</p>
<p>This mobilisation comes despite losing out on commercial revenue in the form of first aid training and covering public events like football matches and concerts.</p>
<p>Speaking after the meeting, Graham said: “It was great to receive an update from Ashley about how St John Ambulance has risen to meet the challenge posed by coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Although it’s disappointing that their base on Morton Lane is to close, it was clear from our meeting that the building’s no longer fit for purpose.”</p>
<p>“It’s reassuring to hear that SJA will be supporting local units to carry on operating, so their wonderful volunteers can keep using their clinical skills and expertise to care for people in our area.</p>
<p>“As part of its £750 million package for charities, the Government has given St John’s a grant of £6 million to help keep their core operations going. Long may their excellent work continue.”</p>
<p>Ashley Mason, the Chair of the Humber County Priory Group, added: “It was good to meet with Graham to share the excellent work of St John’s volunteers.</p>
<p>“Over the last few months, not only have our hardworking, life-saving volunteers supported cancer patients and cared for homeless people, we’ve placed hundreds of trained volunteers in hospital A&amp;Es to help alleviate pressure, and provided emergency ambulance crews across the country.</p>
<p>“At the peak of the crisis, this involved an incredible 75 volunteer-crewed ambulances on COVID-related operations every day.”</p>

<p><strong>Below is a copy of the letter sent to Council Leader Donald Davies and Executive Member James Tonkin:</strong></p>



<p>I saw the recently-released ‘North Somerset Local Plan 2038: Choices for the Future’&nbsp;document and wanted to get in touch with a response. There are several&nbsp; areas where&nbsp;I’d strongly support the direction in which&nbsp;the Council is heading&nbsp;but, equally, others where I fear it could make&nbsp;current problems worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>‘Garden Villages’ (Mostly) Gone</strong></em><br><br>Local people have always accepted we need to build more homes in North Somerset, because they want affordable places for their children to live as they grow up. But concreting over green fields or degrading the rural environment isn’t the right way to do it, so I’m delighted&nbsp;the small town (called a ‘Garden Village’) between Churchill and Congresbury has gone from 3 of the 4 choices&nbsp;in&nbsp;the consultation document. I hope we can eliminate it from the fourth option too, because it is appallingly un-green: it will need a great deal of costly, carbon-intensive&nbsp;new infrastructure and will massively increase car commuting, which will raise emissions&nbsp;and create even more congestion on narrow rural lanes and roads.&nbsp;<br><br><em><strong>Build&nbsp;Up, Not Out</strong></em></p>



<p>I&nbsp;was also delighted to see an increased focus on ‘Build&nbsp;Up, Not Out’ and much-needed urban regeneration in urban areas like central Weston across the choices document. ‘Build Up Not Out’&nbsp;is greener, because it makes it easier for people to live within bicycling or walking distance of where they work, and because it uses existing community infrastructure (whether it’s roads, water, power, schools etc) more efficiently instead of having to start everything&nbsp;from scratch if we build on green fields. It increases the development potential of almost every existing building in central Weston, which should make it easier to attract much-wanted investment. And it gives us the chance to bring fresh life to&nbsp;places like Weston high street as they stop being retail-only districts, and become more ‘alive after five’ instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, I’ve been pushing for this for some time, both nationally and locally, so&nbsp;the recent Government extension of Permitted Development Rights (PDR) which does as I’ve been asking is extremely welcome. But for the PDRs to work, we need to take two further steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The first is for North Somerset Council (NSC) to devise and agree its own Local Development Code (sometimes called a Style Code). This will give local Councillors control of the size, height, style and materials of anything that is built using the new PDRs, so they match the best of what is already here and so&nbsp;local builders know what they can and can’t do. It means there’s a strong democratically-elected local voice in how our communities will look and feel in future, and it creates a ratchet towards distinctive and beautiful public spaces as buildings are built, improved and upgraded over time as well. But it only works if NSC defines a good local development code soon, so I hope that this is an early part of your plans. There is help and support in creating&nbsp;local codes from experts in organisations like Create Streets which I can help you access if you aren’t speaking to them already.</li><li>The second is for Government Ministers to count more of&nbsp;the homes that will be built under the new PDRs against whatever housing targets each local Council has to achieve. Your officers have made clear to me that, at the moment, they don’t get enough credit or recognition from central Government, even if they create PDR opportunities for thousands of good-looking new town-centre homes and apartments to be built, and that clearly isn’t right. So I hope you&nbsp;saw me raising the issue alongside Liam Fox&nbsp;in Parliament recently, and I plan to pursue it vigorously with Government Ministers in future too. I&nbsp;will keep you informed of how they react!</li></ol>



<p><em><strong>New Green Belt</strong></em></p>



<p>There’s a lot of&nbsp;discussion in the document about ‘changes to the Green Belt’. Many of them would affect the north of the District, in Liam Fox’s constituency, so I will leave him to represent local views on those proposals. But there are two&nbsp;important missed opportunities&nbsp;for more. new green belt in the south of the District which don’t feature in any of the 4 options. They are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>A&nbsp;block of completely new green belt in the southeast of our District, stretching inland of&nbsp;the M5, from the southern edge of the existing green belt down to the northern boundary of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).</li><li>A new commitment by North Somerset Council that every acre or hectare of Green Belt which is removed in the new plan will be&nbsp;replaced by at least 3 new ones elsewhere in the District (‘3 in,&nbsp;1 out’)</li></ol>



<p>Taken together, these two measures will protect more of our local environment forever, no matter what future local plans or Government Ministers may propose. They will ensure we are a sustainable, green community where wildlife has places to live, and where our children and grandchildren can enjoy North Somerset’s green spaces as much as we have. I hope you will include them both in the final version of the Plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Help From Bristol &amp; Central Government</strong></em></p>



<p>There are two more areas where we need help from outside:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The first is from Bristol Council. For at least 40 years, North Somerset has soaked up the overspill of their unmet housing need but, with the new PDRs which Government Ministers are introducing to encourage&nbsp;‘Build&nbsp;Up, Not Out’ (above), there is no need for us to keep doing it anymore. In fact&nbsp;it’s time to turn the tables, because the same arguments that mean ‘Build Up Not Out’ would be good for central&nbsp;Weston, apply even more strongly to large areas of Bristol which are just two stories tall at the moment. The number of good-looking, green and affordable homes which could be built within a short walk or&nbsp;cycle ride from work in Bristol is potentially huge; far bigger than anything that could be delivered in North Somerset. So it’s time for a reset in our (and their) long-held assumptions, and for them to return a&nbsp;favour&nbsp;by absorbing some of North Somerset’s unmet housing need, after decades of us doing the same for them. I hope you will begin discussions with them about this as soon as possible.</li><li>The second is for Government Ministers to reconsider the draft housing targets which they have floated as being needed to be built in North Somerset over the coming years. You have already written to me about this, and both I and Liam Fox agree with you that the proposed figures are impossible. I have already written to Ministers making this point alongside yourselves a few months ago, and I hope you also saw both Liam and I driving it home to the Housing Minister in a Parliamentary debate recently too. I am looking forward to continuing to work alongside you on this in future.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><em><strong>Banwell’s Bypass</strong></em></p>



<p>It was wonderful to see the&nbsp;Banwell Bypass in all four of the options in the Choices document. I have spoken to Government officials as well as Council ones, and progress looks slow but steady. Local people will want to see this project delivered as quickly as possible, after we’ve all waited so long.&nbsp;<br><br><em><strong>Stop Ignoring The M5</strong></em></p>



<p>Even if we maximise every opportunity to create sustainable and green communities where people live closer to work by&nbsp;‘Building Up, Not Out’ in Weston and in Bristol; and even if we improve train and bus transport links dramatically (as we should), the M5 north of Weston&nbsp;between J21 and J20 will still need&nbsp;work. Given the jams and congestion it causes already, and all the extra homes which are due to be built in our area, the number of commuter car journeys will inevitably increase. We can and should minimise the rate of growth&nbsp;and make each journey cleaner, and the pandemic may create a one-off cut in commuting too, but no-one seriously expects the long term underlying trend to change or reverse.</p>



<p>So we shouldn’t kid either ourselves&nbsp;or local residents&nbsp;that the M5 can be left out of the local Plan. In fact it’s a major local opportunity, if we can get J21 and M5 flowing smoothly, we’d be gifting local people as much as 5 hours a week extra with their families, reduce&nbsp;damaging emissions and make Weston more attractive to businesses, investors&nbsp;and visitors&nbsp;too.&nbsp;I’ve already begun discussions&nbsp;with Highways England and Transport Ministers, and they are all receptive. But it’s&nbsp;very early days and there’s still a long way to go. I hope you will accept that this can’t be ignored any longer, and that the local Plan must include motorway improvements as a central and strategic part of our local vision for the future.</p>



<p>I am also concerned that all four of the options suggested in the Plan document include a new employment zone on the inland side of J21. Given the problems the junction has already, creating a new commuter bottleneck as more people have to struggle out of town to work on the other side of the M5 and back seems silly. We should&nbsp;certainly be creating sustainable communities where there are plenty of new jobs to go with the extra houses, but they should be close to each other to minimise commuting and emissions, and certainly not on opposite sides of a junction that’s already a bottleneck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope this helps, and I look forward to working with you so we can keep the various welcome positive measures in this document, while fixing the remaining problems too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,<br><br>John Penrose<br><em>MP for Weston-super-Mare</em></p>

    <title>Two simple priorities; protect people, protect jobs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/two-simple-priorities-protect-people-protect-jobs/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=two-simple-priorities-protect-people-protect-jobs" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;For Government, there should be two simple priorities during this pandemic; the first is to protect people in our communities by preventing the virus from spreading, the second is to protect jobs and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Healthy communities need as close to full employment as possible, not just because families need to put food on the table, but also because a failure to protect jobs has far-reaching adverse effects. Countless academic studies have shown a strong link between personal, family and community health and people having a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;It matters to the fabric of our society. That’s why I’ve spent so much of my time as your MP arguing for ways to protect jobs and ensuring people have financial help to navigate this emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Seven months into this pandemic and over 3 million people are still getting no support from the UK Government. The Scottish Government is doing what it can to plug the gaps in support but, it’s gone beyond the funding it’s had from Westminster, and without borrowing powers cannot go much further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Ordinary folk in our community abandoned because they don’t fit into one of the Chancellors narrow groups. They are newly self-employed, freelancers or owners of micro-business and those often forced by circumstance to work in the gig economy. They are the photographers, musicians, drivers, small business owners and young entrepreneurs just starting out. They pay their taxes, they’ve done everything right and need a safety net in their hour of need like everyone else. It shouldn’t matter if it’s a little trickier to work out how to estimate their support, as HMRC claim &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp; this is about doing what is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;These 3 million people have no or little work and have had no support from the Chancellor. Many cannot even claim Universal Credit because of its failings and inflexibility as a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;They are getting more desperate by the day and need their safety net. I have raised their plight many times with the Chancellor and will continue to do so. Colleagues, including some Tory backbenchers, have joined me, in these calls. We’ve offered countless solutions, but the Chancellor seems determined not to act – just as they have refused to give the Scottish Government borrowing powers so it can step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Last week, I asked the Minister if it is simply the case that they don’t care – once again, he chose to duck the question.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith tells Government ‘the people of the north will hold you to account’ on rebalancing the economy.</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I took part in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DanJarvisMP&lt;/a&gt; debate on support for the economy in the North. We need a fundamental rebalancing of our economy after Covid. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this Government to account for their promises and their actions. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCcp6jNBhp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCcp6jNBhp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judith Cummins (@JudithCummins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudithCummins/status/1326541226452004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP and Ex-RAF Serviceman Steve McNamara Remark on Remembrance Sunday 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional remembrance memorial services have halted by the coronavirus pandemic, preventing gatherings around memorials and cenotaphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps believes that this should not lessen our commitment to remembering those who have died in war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting the Hatfield Memorial Garden, Mr Shapps said: “Today cuts very deep inside really because it makes you recall…the ultimate sacrifice that so many have given to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so easy to forget what they went through- the horror of it all- so that we could live in peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve McNamara, an RAF veteran from Welwyn Garden City with grandfathers who fought in both First and Second World Wars, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think every generation has historic, cataclysmic events that define them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this generation, it is probably COVID. It has produced heroes and victims, and I think these will be remembered in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps also spoke of the vital role of the Armed Forces in the battle against the virus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a Remembrance Sunday like no other, as we battle this coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the thing to remember is that a lot of the people that we’re here commemorating and thanking, are actually out there serving right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thousands internationally, but also at home in the battle against the virus- for example in Liverpool, helping with mass-testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps laid a wreath at the Hatfield memorial. He said: “I think in the Armed Forces we have as much to thank today as we ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why Remembrance Sunday- even remembering it slightly differently than usual is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video of the visit was produced, which you can view below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Financial support for those in the North</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2020/11/04/financial-support-for-those-in-the-north/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It could not be more clear that the North is being treated completely differently to the South. I took the opportunity yesterday to question the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, about what financial support package would be available to businesses and workers going forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior to this lockdown announcement, we had had almost universal calls for an extension to the full furlough scheme in areas with tighter restrictions, which Ministers had rejected for months. Despite that, the Government saw fit to announce a new version of this on Saturday, only hours before the previous furlough was due to be replaced by an inferior scheme for us in the north, as further restrictions were becoming inevitable in many areas. Many people in the north therefore now believe that until workers in the south were to be affected by the national lockdown, they were somehow thought to be worth less. Businesses in Gateshead and elsewhere are desperate for clarity and certainty to help them in planning and so that they know whether and how they can survive. Will the Chief Secretary commit today to publishing details of a comprehensive, ongoing financial support package available to businesses and their workers in areas that will continue to need it, where tiers of restrictions might, sadly, have to continue after 2 December?</p></blockquote>
<p>The full debate can be found at: <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-03a.162.0&amp;s=ian+mearns#g174.0">https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-03a.162.0&amp;s=ian+mearns#g174.0</a></p>

<p> Many people have contacted me in the last few days about the anti-social use of fireworks.</p>



<p>I recognise the stress and anxiety they can cause to smaller children, older people and those who suffer from mental health issues, as well as to pets and livestock. I also recognise that most people who do use fireworks, do so responsibly.</p>



<p>Since 2005, the sale of fireworks to the public has been prohibited, except for from licensed traders. It is an offence to use fireworks after 11pm and before 7am without permission, except on permitted fireworks nights, when the times are extended. On Bonfire Night the cut-off time is 12 midnight. </p>



<p>Given the age of our current fireworks regulations, the UK Government should look at them urgently to determine the changing impact of fireworks and whether any changes to the law are needed. </p>



<p>This year, Bonfire Night will be very different to those that have gone before.  </p>



<p>Please be safe, responsible and considerate of others where you can. </p>

    <title>Kickstart Scheme</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://kitmalthouse.com/2020/kickstart-scheme/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=kickstart-scheme" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
October: Kit Malthouse urges local employers to take up the £2bn Kickstart
Scheme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Government’s £2billion
apprenticeship scheme covers the whole cost of hiring an apprentice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kit Malthouse
MP: ‘We must create opportunities for young people and back businesses”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kit Malthouse
has written to the largest local employers and small business groups urging
them to take up the government’s world leading £2 billion “Kickstart” apprenticeship
scheme designed to get 16-24-year olds into work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
government will fully fund each “Kickstart” job &amp;#8211; paying 100% of the
age-relevant National Minimum Wage, National Insurance and pension
contributions for 25 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition,
the government will grant businesses £1,500 per placement to cover the set up
costs or any support or training that may be required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are 635
unemployed 16-24-year olds across Test Valley, with 315 in Andover, getting
them into work is vital for their long-term career prospects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses
need to be able to offer 30 apprenticeship placements to apply, or they can go
through an intermediary. Locally, the Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, Enham
Trust and New Forest Business Partnership are all administering applications
for the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kit
Malthouse MP said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Young people’s jobs are being especially hard
hit by COVID and at a vital time for their professional development. The skills
and experienced gained early in a career provide the solid foundation needed to
grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time businesses can’t afford to
take many risks in these uncertain times, so the government will cover the cost
and eliminate the risk. The kickstart scheme is a win-win for businesses and
apprentices and I encourage employers of all shapes and sizes to sign up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about kickstarting our
country’s economy – it is an opportunity to kickstart the careers of thousands
of young people who could otherwise be left behind as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scheme will open the door to a brighter
future for a new generation and ensure the UK bounces back stronger as a
country.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>This month sees the end of the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, which was put in place at the start of lockdown to avoid mass job losses. It leaves many people in Bristol South facing a very uncertain future.</p>
<p>I, and my Labour colleagues, have been pushing to see the scheme extended for those hardest hit sectors which are still unable to operate properly due to ongoing restrictions. Disappointingly, the Government chose to ignore the calls from us, from business owners, trade unions, think tanks, the cross-party Treasury Select Committee and some of its own MPs; in doing so, it has let down hundreds of thousands of people working in vulnerable industries such as hospitality, leisure, travel and the arts.</p>
<p>Bristol South does not have lots of large employers which can accommodate mass remote working set up. Families across Bristol South rely on paid work with Bristol Airport and in cafes, bars and restaurants as well as the creative sector. It’s home to lots of small businesses, many of which were struggling before the pandemic hit and this has made things a hundred times harder. I’ve heard from local business owners and self-employed people with heartbreaking stories of their family business, in the community for decades employing local people, suddenly facing financial ruin and closure as a result of this pandemic.</p>
<p>The percentage of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Bristol South has already risen from 3.6% in March to 6.2% this summer, and this is likely to increase further. I’m hearing from lots of people who’ve always worked and have never had to apply for government support before. And it’s hitting women and young people particularly hard. We must act now to avert the biggest jobs crisis of a generation.</p>
<p>The Government announced the launch of a Kickstart scheme to support younger jobseekers in August, but we’re yet to see this in action and there appears to be no job guarantee at the end of it. I welcome the offer of extra paid incentives for businesses taking on new apprentices and would encourage employers in Bristol South to explore this further, but they too will need jobs at the end of their training and, at the moment, there is no guarantee there either.</p>
<p>This piecemeal approach is not enough. We need a national plan for job retention and creation as well as retraining. I will continue lobbying the Government on this and am working on plans for my 2021 jobs and apprenticeships fair to help link local people up with jobs and training opportunities. In the meantime, there is help available locally to support people with job hunting and employability skills, see <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/16/support-for-employers-and-jobseekers/"><strong>here</strong></a> for more details.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/28/opinion-karin-smyth-mp-on-a-rise-in-unemployment-in-bristol-south/" target="_blank">OPINION: Karin Smyth MP on a rise in unemployment in Bristol South</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Garforth Station – step free access ready for planning permission.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.alecshelbrooke.co.uk/garforth-railway-station-step-free-access-ready-planning-permission/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Network Rail is preparing the final stages of delivering step-free access at Garforth Railway Station, it has been announced. </p>
<p>Alec had been campaigning for new step-free access at Garforth for over a decade before finally securing funds direct from the Department for Transport. Alec will continue to work closely, cross-party, with Garforth’s Independent Councillors to represent the views of residents through the planning process. </p>
<p>Announcing the scheme in 2014, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “After years of false starts and broken promises under Labour, it is a testament to the local Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke’s persistent campaigning that I can announce that this scheme is finally happening for the people of Garforth”.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Alec has been in regular contact with Transport officials pushing for firmer plans and no further delays. He also raised the matter several times in the House of Commons Chamber. </p>
<p>But today it has been announced that the final stage before construction is now underway.</p>
<p>Alec said: “Today I’m delighted that Network Rail has formalised a plan with four options for stakeholders to choose from before the submission of a full planning application to Leeds City Council. It is my hope that Leeds City Council can deal with the application swiftly to avoid no further delays”.</p>
<p>“I have been campaigning for step-free access at Garforth Station for many years. We had an original plan submitted but this then incurred unnecessary delays along the way but I have been committed to providing disabled people and pushchair users with the same access to travel as everyone else – and delivering step-free access at Garforth station will help thousands more people travel easily and without additional cost, time or stress”.</p>
<p>Previously, Garforth resident Mrs Morris said: “We’ve waited far too long for disabled access at Garforth. The elderly, disabled and those with pushchairs have not been able to use the station so we’re extremely grateful to Alec for fighting alongside us to deliver this disabled access”. </p>
<p>The Government’s Access for All programme was first launched in 2006 and has delivered more than 200 accessible routes into selected stations so far.</p>
<p>A further 1,500 stations have received smaller scale improvements such as accessible toilets, platform humps to reduce stepping distances and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment.</p>
