<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is continuing his stream of correspondence with the Minister for Environment and Land Reform, Mairi McAllan, stressing over and over again the strength of feeling against Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMA) in the islands.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has repeatedly written to the Minister to impress the strength of feeling against HPMAs and called for the plans to be dropped. He also responded to the consultation which is now closed.</p>



<p>This week he has continued that correspondence, in response to a letter of response from the Minister, asking for details of when the Minister will visit locations on the West Coast in the next stage of the consultation process.</p>



<p>The Minister stated in her letter of response to Mr MacNeil that she did not believe it was the case that nobody in the islands wanted areas with enhanced marine protection and cited the experience of Lamlash Bay in Arran where the community campaigned for extra protection and have benefitted from that.</p>



<p>In response Mr MacNeil said: “There may indeed be one or two people in favour of HPMAs in the Hebrides, but I haven’t come across them I have to say. There may also indeed be one or two people in favour of unification of Scotland with Russia at the moment, but I also haven’t come across them and I don’t think such an approach is a sound basis for making that a sensible argument.</p>



<p>“On the serious and substantial point of Lamlash Bay, it has been cited several times, but Lamlash Bay has happened without any HPMA legislation, in fact this makes the case for not needing the legislation by mentioning Lamlash Bay.”</p>



<p>He added: “The Minister stated that they would continue to engage with communities, and I have asked the Minister to provide me with details of where and when these meetings will happen.</p>



<p>“It is crystal clear that communities in Na h-Eileanan an Iar are totally opposed to HPMAs. HPMAs will cause further economic misery which will do nothing for the environment given that the areas that they want to protect are those that are already fished and looked after sustainably.”</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why, in addition to the 500+ casework emails, letters and telephone calls I receive each week, as well as my various campaign work, I run a regular programme of Supermarket and Community Surgeries here in Mid Norfolk – moving them around the constituency to make it as easy as possible for people to come and see me.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Last Friday, my Supermarket Surgery visits took me to Dereham’s Morrisons.

<p>Currently, Kendal's Urgent Treatment Centre closes at 11pm with mobile doctors provided by Cumbria Health on Call (CHOC) operating from a base at the hospital until 8am.</p>
<p>However, CHOC are now consulting on removing the out of hours service from Westmorland General Hospital during the hours of 2am-8am on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>Instead, the out-of-hours doctors will be based at the Furness General Hospital in Barrow and Penrith &amp; Eden Community Hospital.</p>
<p>This will mean significantly increased travel times for doctors to treat patients in the South Lakes.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"This reduction in our local health service is completely unacceptable and must be stopped.</em></p>
<p><em>"It is not acceptable to put vulnerable people, including those receiving palliative care, families caring for loved ones with dementia and patients with learning difficulties, in a position where they will have to wait much longer to receive care - especially those in our most rural areas.</em></p>
<p><em>"Please make your voice heard your support by signing our petition today."</em></p>

    <title>Dunne welcomes Opening of New Ambulance Hub at Princess Royal Hospital</title>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-date field--type-datetime field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;28 June 2023&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;div class="field field--name-field-page-builder field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field--items"&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dunne welcomes Opening of New Ambulance Hub at Princess Royal Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Shropshire MP Philip Dunne welcomes the new ambulance hub commissioned recently at Princess Royal Hospital, Telford, which aims to enhance patient care and streamline services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SaTH) has successfully secured £1.2 million to establish this freestanding facility adjacent to the Emergency Department. Since opening in April 2023, the ambulance hub has provided eight spaces for efficient patient offloading and assessment, reducing handover delays for patients arriving by ambulance at A&amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further enhance patient flow, an additional £114,000 has been secured to expand the Discharge Lounge, resulting in the creation of eight extra spaces at Princess Royal Hospital. These lounges are dedicated to patients awaiting discharge who require medication or transportation, consequently alleviating pressure on beds and reducing waiting times for admissions to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Philip Dunne said,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that this ambulance hub at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford has been established. This substantial investment of £1.2 million will enhance patients' experiences and improve their access to emergency care. The hub's close proximity to the Emergency Department and its eight dedicated spaces will enable efficient offloading and assessment of patients, thereby reducing handover delays. This, in turn, will allow ambulance response times to be improved as areas can be released more quickly for their next assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition, the creation of a new Discharge Lounge, with an investment of £114,000, will also facilitate the smooth flow of patients through the hospital. This will help free up beds and reduce waiting times for patients awaiting admission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SPEECH: STANDING UP FOR MORTGAGE PRISONERS</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin led a debate in the House of Commons on the issue of &lt;a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9411/"&gt;mortgage prisoners&lt;/a&gt;. Here is an extract of his speech transcribed via Hansard:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Docherty-Hughes MP (SNP, West Dunbartonshire): &lt;/strong&gt;I want to begin this vital debate with something of a confession: I did not know too much about Mortgage Prisoners until just a couple of weeks ago, and so while I understand many of you here today have been working away on this issue for a while, and may be members of the APPGs or other groups, I am still in a state of astonishment and frankly anger that this situation happened in the first place, and that it has been perpetuated by successive British Governments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while it may be convenient to lay these problems at the current, tired, Government’s door, many of the disastrous decisions that brought took place under the previous Labour Government, and have simply been rolled over into over a decade of what seems like unbearable mental torture for those stuck in this predicament.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I want to thank my constituent Chris Dorman from Duntocher for allowing me to bring this issue before the house, and for agreeing to share his story so publicly: I am only sorry in instances like this that we as MPs so often find it difficult to address historic injustices, only to highlight them and hope that the Government of the day will listen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before I tell Chris’ story, I want to be very clear at the outset what I’d like to hear answers from the Minister and indeed the Shadow Minister:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Can we have a moratorium on evictions for Mortgage Prisoners?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Can we see a cap put on the standard variable rates being offered to victims?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• And will the government pledge to set up a vehicle for those in these ‘closed book’ prisons to pivot back into the mainstream market again?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are three fairly straightforward asks that the Minister can now take really over an hour to find an answer to as we go on with the debate, and I and those watching at home would really appreciate an answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it turns out I knew Chris Dorman’s mum: Rose was and remains to many a legend in Clydebank’s history, a working class history so seldom reflected in places such as this, being a founding member of the first Credit Union in Scotland in the Dalmuir Credit Union, helping countless families just like the one I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is relevant because I think we need to begin any discussion about mortgage prisoners with a firm rebuttal of any idea that these people are ‘bad borrowers’ who were to blame for their own predicament.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chris comes from a family that knows how mortgages work, and how people should go about choosing a lender and a product that is not going to cause them or their families problems in future scenarios. So when Chris took out a mortgage with Northern Rock in 2003 to buy a flat, I don’t doubt he would have kicked the tyres of the agreement, and known where to look for potential pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But of course he wouldn’t have found any: Northern Rock was a Triple A lender; one of the largest lenders in the country; a fast-growing national presence that still had its roots in the North East of England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I too got my first mortgage with Northern Rock around the same time, and believe me this is not the only element of Chris’ story where ‘but for the grace of god go I’ is my overriding emotion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2007, as Northern Rock crumbled in the bank run which heralded the start of the financial crash the next year, Chris was forced on to an interest-only plan. Now, while for many people, switching to an interest-only payment is usually a stop gap because of short-term financial circumstances, for people in Chris’ position, it has been the beginning of their problems, as this entirely understandable decision then renders them unable to change their lender, as many of us do these days, and move on to a more attractive rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, through the actions of the now-nationalised Northern Rock, Chris was flung to the mercy of a Standard Variable Rate that began to diverge quite significantly from the Bank of England’s average SVR – a decision that we will see was quite deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So during a period where all of us were dealing with the most significant global recession for decades, people like Chris were having to come to terms with this extra dollop of uncertainty. They probably didn’t know it at the time, but what would have initially felt like a short term inconvenience was turning into a prison, even if there were already some organisations sounding the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And like so many, Chris was forced to persist with this entirely inconvenient and increasingly costly arrangement, unable to switch to a better deal, making a mockery of the idea of home ownership and the free market being liberating to individuals &amp;amp; families: through the last decade he has been paying the 6 or 7% interest rates many are complaining of today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this is where we can begin to see a bit of the societal impact of this policy. Duntocher, where he lives, is a fairly normal part of my constituency socio-economically: it is not poor, but the wealthiest part of West Dunbartonshire either. It is a community – an ancient Roman site, and then medieval mill town which predates Clydebank – which has a lot of small, locally-owned business which would have benefited from the thousands of pounds each year that Chris and his family was overpaying on their mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget, for well over a decade, it was the UK Government that was the ultimate holder of this mortgage, through UK Asset Resolution. I can only imagine myself thinking that the Government would not be doing anything to deliberately harm the hundreds of thousands of UK residents in this position, and that a sensible resolution would eventually be found – as we will see there were numerous attempts to address the issue through the various Conservative governments we’ve lived through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was not a purgatory before things got better however: they were about to get worse. In 2019, UKAR sold a tranche of books, including Chris’ to a company called Heliodor. He’d never heard of it, and with good reason, because it is an entity that I or any of us here could not borrow from – it is a vehicle which exists solely to service these existing Northern Rock mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it operates in a regulated market, Heliodor’s ultimate owners, Topaz Finance Limited are not a regulated entity, and rely on Third Party Administrators who are regulated by the FCA in order to comply with their regulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, and significantly in Chris’ cases, as Kath Scalan et al’s report from the LSE points out, the setting of SVRs is not a regulated activity, meaning that a business opportunity for morally ambivalent vulture funds like Topaz has been created, and people like my constituents are offered up as hosts for a parasite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite being someone who had never fallen behind on his payments, Chris found himself subject to a host of fees and other spurious ‘admin’ charges, and incredibly saw the principle he owed rise by almost £10,000 in a few short years, with no additional lending being offered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has now pushed Chris into negative equity, as the money he owes Heliodor becomes more than the value of the flat he shares with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for me this is not the cruellest part of this sorry tale of Modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he approaches the end of the 25 year term of his mortgage, and having been forced onto this interest only plan just a few short years after he began repayments, Chris risks losing his family home of a quarter century unless he can come up with the full amount he owes Heliodor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is this aspect I find most galling: the inversion of the principle of home ownership, with people ending up paying what is essentially rent to a vulture fund which almost certainly knows it will then be able to acquire the property at the end of the term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Topaz finance will have been licking its lips at a deal where it is basically guaranteed to get paid twice: firstly from the monthly payments that Chris and his wife have been making, and then when they sell their house from under them in 2029, at a healthy profit over what they picked it up for in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The toll of this on Chris, as you can imagine, has been severe. Now unable to work through the mental and physiological strain this has provoked it is now down to his wife, a nurse, to work all the hours she can to make sure they can stay in their house: although understanding the bitter irony that this is only likely a temporary respite until the hammer will inevitably fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so it is up to us as MPs to make sense of this personal calamity: to think of the consequences of this story of one of my constituents extrapolated over the hundreds of thousands of people across these islands potentially affected is unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, how do we even begin to comprehend how we could not only ensure that our constituents are protected from the avarice of these vulture funds, but that somehow there can be some sort of recognition for the years that they have lived under this ever-increasing pressure: how do you make up for opportunities missed; holidays not booked; families unable to grow and dreams unrealised?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Chris said, this is essentially a form of legalised loan sharking: although unlike illegal loan sharks, vulture funds like Topaz Financial don’t break your legs – they break your spirit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One small shaft of light has been the dawning realisation among mortgage prisoners that they’ve been exploited by so many of these actors we’re going to hear about today: and I want to thank the UK Mortgage Prisoners group for the work they have done, including their most recent report ‘Setting the Record Straight’ which helped me understand how tragically the experiences of my constituent Chris are very much not unique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this second part of my speech I very much want to explore the opportunities that were missed along the way to avoid this disaster, and to make sure that the possibility of tens or hundreds of thousands of these mortgage prisoners being put out on the street and coming into the ambit of local councils and social services is very much acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In doing so, it is important to cast our minds back to 2008, when Northern Rock was a prime lender, and in the Top 5 nationally. The LSE report I have already cited puts it very well: &lt;em&gt;“The problem of mortgage prisoners was largely created by the actions of successive UK governments in trying to address the excessively risky lending of the early 2000s. The prisoners…are a legacy of the rapid mortgage market expansion that took place prior to the Global Financial Crisis.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know by now the plethora of seemingly innovative mechanisms to enable wider home ownership, including high loan-to-value ratios. Banks like Northern Rock or Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley that were offering these novel products were household names, well known brands that many would not think twice about borrowing with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling stated clearly in November 2007 that &lt;em&gt;“I can tell the House that Bank of England lending is secured against assets held by Northern Rock, which include high-quality mortgages with a significant protection margin built in and high-quality securities with the highest quality of credit rating”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when these books were then brought under the auspices of the UKAR, borrowers could have been forgiven for thinking all would be well: they were paying their mortgages and the UK Government would ensure they weren’t taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were, even then however those inside and outside government warning about the potential risks of this approach: consumer group Which, for example, told the Treasury Select Committee in 2009 that: &lt;em&gt;“Northern Rock’s mortgage business strategy seems to consist of telling many of its existing customers to go elsewhere and coming down hard on those who have got nowhere to go by having a relatively high standard variable rate and a rapid move towards repossession.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the Treasury itself, in the same year was quite clear about the risks of allowing these unregulated firms to take over the Northern Rock books, stating in a report that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Firms not engaging in regulated activity are not bound by the requirements of FSA regulation including, importantly, the requirement to treat customers fairly. Non regulated owners of regulated mortgage contracts may seek to maximise margins by raising interest rates and charges, potentially to levels that are unaffordable to borrowers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going on, the same document stated, clear as day that: &lt;em&gt;“Such activity clearly has the potential to cause severe harm to borrowers”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, incredibly the UK Government carried on regardless. Despite falling interest rates as the recission bit, this government-owned bank settled on a margin of 4.29% over base for its SVR, an increase of 205% in its first year of operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they made the prison complete. Hundreds of thousands of our constituents paying over the odds for a product they had bought in good faith, and unable to go anywhere else. And for why? The best explanation I can find is in the UK Mortgage Prisoner’s report – the UK Government wanted to ‘sell the books as soon as possible for as high a price as possible.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The action group’s report is a damning inditement of the continued failures of government policy, but one which manages to keep the obvious emotional distress this must has caused its members just below the surface, and to devastating effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In meticulously researched tables, we see in black and white the money that has been lost to our economy from this determination to keep the SVR well above the base rate: from my calculations my constituent and his family will have overpaid at least £40,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And as I’ve said earlier, if we can’t take away the pain and suffering this has caused over these years, we do at least owe them an answer as to why this has happened. As we heard earlier, the LSE attributes this to the general climate created before the 2008 crash, but I think it is important to acknowledge how deep these roots are, because we are still dealing with so much of that fallout today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This long tail of that era of neo liberal economics is still so pernicious, because it confuses concepts like ‘taxpayer value’ with what any of us hear would normally take it to mean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taxpayer value is not found in pauperising hundreds of thousands of households: it is not to be found in scrabbling back every single penny we as taxpayers saw spent on ensuring the economy didn’t collapse overnight. Government is not a bank, with shareholders that need to see the principle of loans paid back in full. It is an institution that is able to intervene in the economy at strategic moments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is an idea that is slowly coming back into fashion, but I wonder how many of our national assets have found their way into the paws of this type of offshore capital in the intervening 40 years, leaving the taxpayer with all of the costs, none of the benefits and absolutely hee haw value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while this current Government can share so much of the blame, and I am sure we will hear from many other members today about the myriad failings they have made over the years, we should take a moment to remember as well that this was a policy that was conceived and established under a British Labour Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And furthermore, it was a Labour Government that had fully embraced this model of deregulated, neoliberal economics: continuing the Thatcherite legacy of public assets being valued only as they were on the balance sheet: and taxpayers existing only in the abstract and not as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was Gordon Brown, that Saint who we heard last week could be elevated to the House of Lords in a Starmer Government, who set up the very same FSA that allowed this tragedy to happen: an FSA that in Brown’s now-infamous words would herald ‘not only light, but limited regulation’ of financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it will not do our constituents much good to dwell on the past: as I begin to draw my remarks to close, let’s revisit the three questions I had for the Minister and the Shadow Minister.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in terms of evictions: as we begin to reach the end of the terms of those who took out 25 or 30 year mortgages at the beginning of the century, let us do what we can to lift this burden they’ve carried with them over these years. I know from reading briefings that the Government is concerned about the ‘moral hazard’ aspect of this type of act: but in 2023 if we are talking about people who have not already had their house repossessed, then these are people who have necessarily kept up with repayments, who have themselves a strong case that the ‘moral hazard’ may very well lie in the other direction, with companies who have deliberately been stringing them along.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a cap on the SVRs being offered to mortgage prisoners is surely the naturally just thing to do, especially in a general climate of mortgage instability. These are people who have been coping with the issue of high interest rates for a considerable period of time, and we gain nothing from pushing them further into debt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course there will be a cost to the taxpayer in the abstract, but this will be an investment that pays itself back through the cascade of money through our own economy instead of into the pockets of an offshore vulture fund: the days of this balance sheet economics needs to end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I understand this has been put forward in the House of Lords, by the co chair of the APPG John Sharkey: I would be interested to hear in addition if the promise made by the Government when that amendment to the Financial Services Bill was withdrawn to meet with mortgage prisoners has indeed been fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, I think the Government owes it to Mortgage Prisoners to find a way for them to help themselves out this mess by looking at a vehicle to allow them to pivot back into the mainstream market again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the first suggestion in the LSE report: free comprehensive financial advice for all victims, with almost 200,000 contacted individually to help them navigate their way out of the quagmire they find themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier on in my speech, it gives me no pleasure to conclude that this would appear to be one of these instances where there is nothing we can do to make up for what UK Mortgage Prisoners calls the ‘extortionate interest rates, severe financial restrictions and mobility and mental &amp;amp; physical issues caused by this Government-made scandal.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try: and I hope the Government can see from the interest in this debate today that they now have a chance to do what they can to right these wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the debate in full &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/aba5ae35-9eeb-4e57-bd11-5ca804ab963c?in=09:30:11"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brexit is good news — Conservative Home article</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As a young man I voted in the 1975 referendum on staying in the European Community. I read the Treaty of Rome which bound us and realised it set out a long journey to European Union. The main political parties told me to vote to stay in something they called the Common market. This lovely myth was a free market, with no damage to our ability to make our own laws and spend our own money. I did not believe them and voted to leave. I found it difficult to grasp how they could so misinterpret the Treaty we had signed.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>             It was a blow when I heard the result. As a  good democrat I congratulated the winners and did my best to get behind their winning vision. I had no wish to undermine their action which I had opposed. I resolved to help the winners implement their vision of keeping the European Community to just a common market, or more likely helping opt us out of all the obvious other integration tasks it was inevitable  the EEC/EU would wish to advance. The Yes campaign had strenuously denied the European foreign policies and military task forces, European migration and crime policies, European taxation and much else that was to evolve.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>              I was in this spirit for twenty years, never challenging the decision to stay in. I was appointed Single market Minister. That was the worst job I had to do in government and showed me from the inside just how far the EC  and its single market had deviated from the common market vision of 1975. Using the market as cover the EC bombarded us with laws over wide ranging topics from the environment to taxation, from health and safety to employment. They sought to lay down in law how businesses in different sectors should do their jobs. The Franco-German axis had undue weight with the Commission, seeking to embed the business models of their main companies into EC law. It was a brilliant power grab. It was anti enterprise and innovation, creating trade barriers without and barriers to innovators and small business from within. My job was the negative one of seeking to delay, defer or amend the worst proposals. I went hoarse explaining a common market just needed the rule that any product deemed to be of merchandisable quality  in one member state could be sold in another. With clear labels consumers could make their own choices,<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>The net result of single market excess law making has been to give a huge competitive boost to the USA where companies have not faced the same controls and legal strictures. The digital revolution which has changed lives and been powered by smartphones, downloads, social media and the web has been dominated by the US. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix, Nvidia and the rest are US titans. There is no single large global digital company from a European base. This is such a dominant part of a modern economy.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>When the EC moved to being the European Union and wanted to press on with a single currency I wrote the books and some of the articles to keep the pound. It was obvious most UK voters understood surrendering our currency would end any pretence of effective self government. Polls  always showed strong majorities against. It was also clear that many MPs and top civil servants wanted to join the Euro or would go along with it. I fought battles within the Conservative Party to firm up our view that the UK should keep its own currency. We persuaded John Major to secure the all important opt out from joining but then had to battle to make sure no Conservative leader flirted with joining nonetheless.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>As the war over the Treaty of Maastricht developed it became clearer to more people the EU was not mainly about trade and a market. It was about building an integrated Union with a flag, a Parliament, a Supreme  Court,extensive law codes, EU taxes and debts, with common policies across all fields. It became obvious to more Conservatives that we needed a new  referendum. The new question would not be to reverse the idea of the common market but to test out the reality that the evolving Union was so much more than a market, and its market was not free. Belonging to its market meant accepting many clumsy laws, paying a large tax to be in it, and putting up with many restrictions on internal and external trade.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>The UK’s predictable and tragic ejection from the European Exchange Mechanism and the nasty recession that caused led to the exile of Conservatives from office for 13 years. In opposition the party wisely opposed the further integration of the Nice, Amsterdam and Lisbon Treaties. Under our democracy it was unacceptable for a new government to get into power unable to govern in many ways owing to the surrender of big powers to the EU by the outgoing government with Opposition support. I and a few other MPs campaigned for a referendum. David Cameron’s good decision to promise one in the 2015 Manifesto helped us win a majority to govern that year for the first time since 1992.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>I am so pleased the UK electors voted to take back control in 2016.  Everyday since I rejoice that we can now shape our future again. So far government has been too cautious, sticking to failed EU laws and policies. Too many MPs and civil servants have fought to prevent the UK altering things to help us succeed, seeking to keep us tied to the EU whatever the costs.   In a future piece I will set out how we can use our freedoms more. It is high time we had some Brexit wins. The USA need not always build the main global business successes. We could narrow the gap in income per head if we tried, now we are free to do so. It will take lower and fewer taxes and better laws to do so.<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>Sent from my iPad</p>

&lt;p&gt;Labour analysis has revealed that the average household in Denton and Reddish is set to be put under more pressure than ever by Conservative mismanagement of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Denton and Reddish, it is estimated that 9,300 home owners will see a rise of around £2100 on their annual mortgage increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows the news that many mortgage deals are being withdrawn by Banks and interest rates increased, with Moneyfacts data suggesting the typical rate on a two-year fixed-rate loan had increased to almost 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, economists warned that there is a real risk of job losses and a sharp recession. The latest forecasts of economic growth this year suggest that the UK is struggling to get out of the slow lane, with growth of just 0.2% forecast on the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeremy-hunt"&gt;Jeremy Hunt&lt;/a&gt; last week agreed measures with banks aimed at cooling the mortgage crisis, including giving people struggling with repayments a 12-month grace period before repossessions begin. However, Labour has been urging ministers to compel banks to be more supportive – claiming around two million households could miss out on the mortgage support they need due to the voluntary nature of the Government&amp;#8217;s current support scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, MP for Denton and Reddish &lt;span class="il"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;Gwynne&lt;/span&gt; said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Tory mortgage penalty is devastating for family finances right across Denton and Reddish and is holding back our economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Local people are asking themselves &amp;#8216;am I better off after 13 years of Tory Government?&amp;#8217; and answering with a resounding &amp;#8216;no&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We need to see the Government forcing banks to help mortgage-owners, and bring financial and economic security back. Families are living on a perpetual financial cliff-edge, and we need to see action.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Nottingham castle reopens for all</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/06/26/nottingham-castle-reopens-for-all/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Labour is very pleased that the castle has re-opened today Monday 26th June. On Exec Board meeting we announced that the re-opening of the castle would take place in June and we are delivering on our promise.&lt;br&gt;We have announced a new general admission price of £12 per adult, allowing people to return as many times as they like for a year, along with free entry for up to three accompanied kids aged 15 and under. This is in response to the rising cost of living, which is a serious problem for many of our communities, and will ensure that all families in Nottingham can once again access the castle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are also proud to be opening the castle with an exhibition to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Windrush in cooperation with Museumand and the National Caribbean Heritage museum and to recognise the massive contribution of the Windrush generation and their descendants on our city’s society and economy.&lt;br&gt;Today the reopening of the castle, was marked by Robin Hood and a merry band of local schoolchildren storming the gates, reclaiming the castle for the Nottingham people. Lots of people benefited from a special £1 ticket for the opening day to make our popular heritage site to all.&lt;br&gt;The opening will include access to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the newly reinvigorated Brewhouse Yard that showcases life of Nottingham through the ages from the 1500s to 1900s,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;the launch of ‘70 Objeks &amp;amp; Tings,’ to celebrate Windrush, brought to one of the Museum’s temporary galleries by Museumand (The National Caribbean Heritage Museum)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;a series of artist commissions and interventions on display around the museum, by Jemisha Maadhavji and Tim Fowler.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A visitor centre and café at the entrance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Access to the Robin Hood and Rebellion Galleries&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use of the land train for the first time after a few years&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;a Hood’s Hideout adventure playground in the dry moat for children to enjoy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;access to the caves- Mortimers Hole and King David’s dungeon for £5 per person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will develop a programme of events, exhibitions, gallery talks and school visits, and offer the site for events such as weddings and corporate functions to ensure that the castle provides a wide range of activities for all to enjoy in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pavlos-Lo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pavlos-Lo-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3097"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cllr Kotsonis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The City Council’s Portfolio Holder for Leisure, Culture and Planning, Cllr Pavlos Kotsonis, said: “We are thrilled to reopen Nottingham Castle for the people of Nottingham and for visitors from beyond the city. The castle belongs to the city’s residents and to all our diverse communities and it gives me great joy to be delivering on the promise made for a June reopening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We worked hard to achieve this in such a short time and we are looking forward to seeing people reconnect with a site that is so important to local people and to the city. We feel sure that the reinvigorated offer available will encourage many people to come back time and time again, with the new ticket allowing people to pay £12 once and visit all year round!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;With the sun shining on saturday it was the perfect weather for a summer fayre!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lovely afternoon calling into the summer event at St Johns Church Walsall Wood where I was joined by local Councillors Mandy Parkes and Keith Sears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a friendly and fun atmosphere for all to enjoy and as is usual at such events I left with an armful of homemade cakes and biscuits and a book for my summer reading list!  I was very tempted by the fantastic plant stall too – maybe next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done to Rev Lisa and everyone for organising this.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

    <title>Labour would fix the Tory mortgage penalty which could see Bristol South residents facing up to £3,000 a year hike in mortgage costs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/06/23/labour-would-fix-the-tory-mortgage-penalty-which-could-see-bristol-south-residents-facing-up-to-3000-a-year-hike-in-mortgage-costs/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=labour-would-fix-the-tory-mortgage-penalty-which-could-see-bristol-south-residents-facing-up-to-3000-a-year-hike-in-mortgage-costs" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has welcomed Labour proposals to fix the Tory mortgage penalty as “another example of Labour standing up for working people”. </p>
<p>New projections show that an estimated 11,700 families in south Bristol could face a £3,000 hike in mortgage costs over the year.</p>
<p>It follows the news that many mortgage deals are being withdrawn by Banks and interest rates being increased, with Moneyfacts data suggesting the typical rate on a two-year fixed-rate loan had increased to almost 6%, almost double a year ago, and the Resolution Foundation estimating that 6.5m households will be affected by the post-mini budget rise in mortgage rates by 2026.</p>
<p>This week, economists warned that there is a real risk of job losses and a sharp recession. The latest forecasts of economic growth this year suggest that the UK is struggling to get out of the slow lane, with growth of just 0.2% forecast on the year. </p>
<p>On Thursday (22 June), Labour’s Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that in government the party would:</p>
<p>–	Require lenders to allow borrowers to switch to interest only mortgage payments for a temporary period, or lengthen the term of their mortgage period.<br/>
–	Require lenders to reverse any support measures when the borrower requests.<br/>
–	Make it required for lenders to wait a minimum of six months before initiating repossessions.<br/>
–	Instruct the FCA to urgently issue consumer guidance that those requesting support should not see their credit score affected.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“The Tory mortgage penalty is devastating for family finances and is holding back our economy. When I speak to constituents, they are open about their fear of the cost of living crisis. We cannot stand by whilst inflation destroys incomes.</p>
<p>“Unlike the Conservative Government, Labour will act. Our Shadow Chancellor has outlined a series of solutions to the chaos imposed on the country by Liz Truss’s mini budget. By making lenders be more flexible and understanding of the situation facing households we can take the interest rate rise shock out of the system. Plus, we would change consumer guidance so that credit scores are not hit when mortgage holders request support from their lender. </p>
<p>“This is just another example of Labour standing up for working people. We can grow a fairer economy and protect people from the extremes of inflation. After 13 long years the Tories have run out of ideas and the public has run out of patience. We need change so we can deliver the better future our country deserves.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/06/23/labour-would-fix-the-tory-mortgage-penalty-which-could-see-bristol-south-residents-facing-up-to-3000-a-year-hike-in-mortgage-costs/">Labour would fix the Tory mortgage penalty which could see Bristol South residents facing up to £3,000 a year hike in mortgage costs</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

<p>As summer arrives, so too does news of the first hosepipe ban of the season and the threat of more to come.</p>



<p>Despite experiencing the wettest March since 1981, parts of the country are already facing a water shortage. Many point to the effects of climate change and its certainly true, across the world, that access to water is as likely to drive migration as much as wars and despots, but here in the UK the finger is increasingly pointed at the behaviour of Britain’s water companies.</p>



<p>Back in 1989 the Thatcher government, having starved state-owned water and sewerage authorities for years of necessary resources to upgrade what is essentially a public health utility, privatised the industry with the promise of vast improvements. Since that time water companies have paid out £72 billion in dividends while increasing our bills by over 40% but there hasn’t been a single, large-scale reservoir built in England since 1981.</p>



<p>Every year there are hosepipe bans all around the country. They destroy plants and gardens, lovingly tended over years, and enjoyed by so many retired people. They close pubs as they can’t maintain hygiene standards at a time when the hospitality trade is struggling, and they cost farmers dear adding further pressures to the cost-of-living crisis.</p>



<p>Last year the combined bonuses for the chief executives of the ten water companies in England and Wales amounted to £14.5billion. Severn Trent’s chief executive is the best paid in the country at around £3.9M, including bonuses. Severn Trent has a four-star rating from the Environment Agency but still managed to discharge sewage into our rivers 45,000 times.</p>



<p>I understand calls to renationalise the water industry although I doubt a priority for an incoming Labour government should be paying billions in compensation to well-heeled shareholders. It’s true something needs to be done, so why not toughen the regulation and take a golden government share in the industry. A share, which allows us to prioritise tackling leaks, building reservoirs, compensating victims of hosepipe bans and ending the pumping of effluent into our rivers, over dividends for shareholders and bonuses for chief executives.</p>

    <title>VCMs, Ve-Tech Concrete, 22 June 2023</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2023/06/22/vcms-ve-tech-concrete-22-june-2023/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="VCMs 22 06 23 15 21 21" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIw4M76rJHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I want to speak on behalf of Ve-Tech Concrete Limited, which is a company in my constituency that operate volumetric mobile concrete plants,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VCMs as they have been described and as it has already been covered by the honourable gentleman for Orkney and Shetland. There are lots of different reasons why there are advantages to these. He&amp;#8217;s already highlighted the fact that they can deliver concrete over distances&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in rural areas that are more than two hours away from a concrete mixing plant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s just an absolute if you&amp;#8217;re further away. A drum concrete mixer simply can&amp;#8217;t serve you. So these can cover parts of the UK that others can&amp;#8217;t. They can also wait until the concrete is required. So when utilities need to make repairs even in the middle of the night or a repair takes longer, the VCM can wait until the concrete is required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can deliver multiple small loads of different strengths of concrete to different consumers. And that is often farmers who need a small amount to make an adjustment around the farm. So in rural communities like mine in Central Ayrshire where farming is covers most of my constituency, the VCMs are vital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would agree with the honourable gentleman who&amp;#8217;s just spoken, whose constituency I can&amp;#8217;t remember. It&amp;#8217;s hard to understand what the 2018 decision was about. If it is about damage to roads, etc, then there are other heavier vehicles that are being allowed on the road. If it&amp;#8217;s about what they carry, and this suggestion that they shouldn&amp;#8217;t carry more goods than a goods vehicle, then there is a failure to understand that actually they are plant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They mix the concrete and therefore they have all the equipment involved in mixing the concrete as it&amp;#8217;s required. And what they also have is pumping equipment so that they don&amp;#8217;t need a separate lorry to turn up to work with a drum mixer, to actually pump the concrete into the place that it&amp;#8217;s required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I heard, I read in the briefing that actually because of access issues, it&amp;#8217;s a VCM that Westminster is using for some of the repairs to the estate. So it&amp;#8217;s really about time that we heard a slightly updated approach to these. So why was the decision made? It&amp;#8217;s hard to understand it if it&amp;#8217;s on the basis of road damage when there are heavier vehicles. It&amp;#8217;s certainly hard to understand it if it&amp;#8217;s about climate. When it&amp;#8217;s clear, VCMs reduce journeys, increase flexibility, and actually are keeping other trucks off the road. So I too hope that maybe there&amp;#8217;s a change of mind in the Department for Transport and maybe the minister will give us some hope and indeed the companies in our constituencies or serving our constituencies right across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brilliant Local Charity Welcomes New CEO</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.shapps.com/brilliant-local-charity-welcomes-new-ceo/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=brilliant-local-charity-welcomes-new-ceo" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Grant Shapps, paid a visit to local charity Resolve to welcome their new CEO as well as meet their team and service users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Resolve is a local charity of which Mr Shapps is the patron. It delivers drug and alcohol support as well as advice and treatment services from its bespoke centre in Woodhall Community Centre in Welwyn Garden City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since it began 15 years ago it has been at the forefront of supporting a wide range of clients with Resolve supporting over 200 people last year alone – running 750 group therapy sessions and 1000 counselling and acupuncture sessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps met the charity’s new CEO, Laura Hyde to discuss how she has been finding the role since taking over in March. He also spent time talking to some of the charity’s clients about their experiences with Resolve, all of which commended the charity for the wonderful support they provide with one client saying, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know where my life would have been without Resolve&amp;#8221;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laura thanked Mr Shapps for visiting and for taking the time to meet the Resolve team and some clients:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was great for some of our Welwyn Garden City team and service users to meet Grant. Grant has been a long-standing supporter of Resolve since it was set up by the founder and former Chief Executive Joe Heeney 15 years ago, with Grant&amp;#8217;s wife even running a fundraising marathon for Resolve many years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am so proud to be the new Chief Executive of Resolve. Resolve saves people&amp;#8217;s lives and helps to support them on their difficult road to recovery”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps thanked Laura and the Resolve team for inviting him to visit:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was wonderful to meet the Resolve team and Laura. I congratulate her on becoming the new CEO of Resolve. I can see how dedicated and passionate she is about her role, so I know she’ll do Resolve proud”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He continued:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Resolve provides vital support for those that need it the most. I wish everyone all the very best for the future”.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Our fantastic Space Park is bringing together our world leading university research with business and industry in state of the art facilities. It aims to create 2,500 high skill, high paid jobs and generate £750m for the wider East Midlands economy.</p>
<p>Last week I helped host a “Leicester West Secondary School Takeover” day. &nbsp;We put on a series of events and talks to inspire students from Babington, Beaumont Leys, Castlemead and New College to think about pursuing a career in the space sector including in engineering, science, IT, data and design.</p>
<p>It was an absolutely amazing day and I am so grateful to the Space Centre for helping to put it on!</p>

    <title>The Fight to Safeguard Essential Banking and Postal Services in Rural Communities</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p>As you may know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mR7-0byx8CI">I have presented the Banking and Postal Services (Rural Areas) Bill</a>, an essential piece of legislation designed to protect the services that our communities across Badenoch and Strathspey so vitally rely on, to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Your voices have been instrumental in driving this process forward. From listening to those on community council groups to those of you I’ve had the pleasure of speaking with on your doorsteps, and to those who have shared their experiences online – I want to extend my heartfelt thanks for making your voices heard.</p>
<p>The concerns you have raised and the stories you have shared underscore the urgent need for us to address service cuts, particularly their impact on our older residents, which are simply unacceptable. These services are more than financial transactions or mail delivery points; they are community lifelines that connect individuals to the wider social and economic network.</p>
<p>The Bill is not simply just legislation; it represents our communal fight to ensure that all of our communities have access to essential banking and postal services. It proposes the implementation of a minimum number of physical branches per population, ensuring rural communities have access to these vital services.</p>
<p>However, our fight is far from over. This is about more than just preventing the last High Street bank in a single community from closing its doors. We must continue to advocate for a framework that works for our rural postmasters and for our communities. We must ensure that our march towards progress doesn’t sideline these vital communities. While digital infrastructure and digital literacy programmes are important, the physical presence of these services is indispensable.</p>
<p>Our rural communities form the bedrock of Scotland. They are responsible for preserving our environment, ensuring food security, and maintaining our cultural heritage. Yet, these communities are often sidelined, left grappling with dwindling essential services. The UK Government’s inaction in addressing these issues has left our rural communities floundering. It is imperative that we take proactive steps to tackle this issue.</p>
<p>The ongoing withdrawal of essential services from our rural communities is not just an issue; it is a crisis. We must ensure that our digital transition is inclusive, compassionate, and considerate of all our citizens, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Your continued support is crucial in this endeavour. Your experiences, your stories, and your voices matter more than ever. Please continue to share them. You can do so by <a href="https://us13.list-manage.com/survey?u=79400f257882be15026d47c7a&amp;id=aaae50e454&amp;attribution=false">clicking here</a> to share your thoughts and experiences.</p>
<p>Together, we can make our case stronger and ensure that everyone’s voice is heard. Let’s continue to work together for a better future for our rural communities.</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-95/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">My week began celebrating Women in Cricket. The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Cricket, chaired by James Daly MP, England and Wales Cricket Board, and Lord’s Taverners hosted the event and we had the opportunity to meet some wonderful famous women cricketers. There was a panel discussion involving the stars and grassroots heroes which focused on the upcoming Ashes, growth of elite women’s cricket, and how to build and grow the game towards the 2026 World Cup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Coalfield Communities I was delighted to attend our Parliamentary launch of the report entitled “<a href="https://www.appgcoalfields.co.uk/levelling-up-the-coalfields">Next Steps in Levelling Up the Former Coalfields</a>” which we published on Monday 12th June. The report is the culmination of evidence gathering sessions, and I thank all contributors. The launch was very well attended by representatives from all over the UK – MPs from all parties, local councillors and officers, trade unions, voluntary organisations, and former miners and their families. The chair Alex Davies-Jones MP (Pontypridd) welcomed everyone and introduced the speakers. Secretariat of the APPG, Chris Whitwood of the Industrial Communities Alliance, presented the report and went through its contents and recommendations. Special thanks to Steve Fothergill, who has been leading on the inquiry and all our previous inquiries. Gary Ellis, CEO, Coalfields Regeneration Trust; Aaron Bell MP; and Owen Thompson MP, responded to the report. The meeting was then opened up for questions from the attendees. I spoke about Thatcher closing down the mines over forty years ago and that she had no plans to replace the livelihoods of the many miners and their families who were left devastated and destitute, and that Neath was a prime example, but that the development of the <a href="https://www.gcre.wales/">Global Centre of Rail Excellence</a> (GCRE) in Onllwyn provided the first real opportunity to bring jobs and apprenticeships to my constituency, so that youngsters will not have to leave to look for employment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was a debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-12/debates/2D29C249-E67F-4787-B72A-A6269147A8FF/RetainedEULaw(RevocationAndReform)Bill">Lords Amendments to the Retained EU Law (Revoke and Reform) Bill</a>. At the end of the Transition Period the EU Withdrawal Act 2018 incorporated most EU Law as applied on December 31st 2020 onto the statute book as “retained EU law”.  There is need to resolve the future status and relevance of retained EU law, how applicable it is and where it should be placed in a hierarchy relative to UK primary legislation. There are over 2,400 pieces of retained EU law to which this Bill will apply covering nearly all Government departments. The Government u-turned on a fundamental aspect of the Bill removing a sunset clause that would have removed all EU retained law from the statute book at the end of 2023. Whilst this is a relief, removing a cliff edge, there are questions about scrutiny and excessive power transfer to the Executive. There were two votes. Lords Amendment 15B which provides that any future regulations restating, revoking or updating retained EU law cannot reduce environmental protection in the UK. The UK Government voted to disagree with this Lords Amendment and won the vote by 269 to 204 votes. Lords Amendment 42B provided for a Commons Committee to examine any plans to revoke or replace retained EU law before being voted on by both Houses before they can be used. The UK Government voted to disagree with this Lords Amendment and won the vote by 269 to 202 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met Nicky Ryan and Steve Treharne at the <a href="https://www.polfed.org/">Police Federation of England and Wales</a> (PFEW) parliamentary drop-in session for Welsh MPs to support their key campaigns: #Pay #SimplifyDG6 and the Elizabeth Medal. In March 2023, PFEW called for a 17% pay increase after a Social Market Foundation study showed police pay has fallen nearly 20% behind inflation between 2000 and 2022, whilst other protective services pay has increased by 1-1.4%, and police pay has risen at barely half the rate of an average UK employee. #SimplifyDG6 asks the UK Government to issue New Supporting Guidelines and Updated FAQs so that police officers can safely share information with prosecutors (CPS) without the gratuitous obligations on officers to redact evidence. On January 10th 2023, my friend Peter Aldous MP, asked Ed Argar MP (Minister for State and Victims Sentencing) to amend the Data Protection Act to end this bureaucratic burden on policing and speed up administration of justice. On 21st February 2023, the Justice Select Committee asked the then Solicitor General whether the UK Government are considering this amendment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the APPG for Rare Diseases, I attended the drop-in event hosted by <a href="https://catapult.org.uk/">Catapult</a>, and the <a href="https://geneticalliance.org.uk/">Genetic Alliance UK</a>, to receive an update about how advanced therapies can transform lives and healthcare, and meet patients who are receiving lifelong treatments which impact severely on their lives, when they could receive a one-time treatment allowing patients and their carers to become or to continue being economically active. Cell and gene therapies can transform people’s lives by addressing the root causes of diseases leading to long-term disease modification. Cell therapy uses living cells to replace missing cells in the body, and gene therapy uses technologies that enable genes to be introduced into the body which modify a genetic information that is the root cause of a disease. They would substantially reduce health care costs, address healthcare inequalities, and create high value jobs, but it needs a changed approach. With coherent and concerted action, the UK can take the lead in demonstrating how to harness the potential of Advanced Therapies to transform health care systems. If fully embraced by the UK’s interrelated health, wellness, and research and innovation structure, Advanced Therapies will keep many more people healthy and fitter for longer, delivering substantially greater value from public expenditure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dolly Parton created the <a href="https://dollywoodfoundation.org/">Dollywood Foundation</a> and I supported the Parliamentary event to celebrate Dolly’s Imagination Library in the UK and to look to the next chapter. Dolly’s Imagination Library has gifted over 5 million books to under-fives in the UK. That’s 5 million moments that have inspired a lifelong love of books and reading in our youngest children.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was a debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-13/debates/5F35C5A7-83E8-4E16-A1DF-0E56E4CDF48D/ProcurementBill(Lords)">Procurement Bill (Lords) Report Stage</a>. The Official Opposition had tabled Amendments to strengthen the Bill, because Labour do recognise the need for this Bill to consolidate the patchwork of former EU rules and create a more straightforward procurement regime, but the Bill is unambitious and fails to take advantage of post Brexit opportunities to promote local businesses and outlaw VIP lanes. The Bill hands more powers to Ministers over direct awards. Amendment 2 would prevent VIP lanes by ensuring that any contract awarded under emergency provisions or direct awards should include transparency declarations and is a recommendation by the independent NAO. The amendment was defeated by 230 to 280 votes. New Clause 10 would clamp down on taxpayer’s money going to tax havens by introducing transparency into the system requiring multinational organisations bidding for large contracts to produce transparent tax reports. The amendment was defeated by 231 to 282 votes. My dear friend Marie Rimmer MP has been campaigning against forced organ harvesting, and Marie tabled an amendment which received cross-party support which is designed to give a discretionary power to exclude suppliers from being awarded a public contract who have participated in forced organ harvesting or unethical activities relating to human tissue including where they are involved in providing a service or goods relating to such activities. Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated by 229 to 280 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">John McNally MP and myself as vice-chair and chair of the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology, met with Rob Smith co-founder at <a href="https://www.getslick.com/">Slick</a> to learn about his services to the sector. Rob told us that Slick is committed to helping business owners grow and build the business of their dreams and that he is optimistic for the sustainability of the UK sector because “the lipstick effect” is as true today as it was over 20 years ago – men and women continue to prioritise spending money on life’s little luxuries, blow dries, manicures, lipstick, rather than costlier purchases such as eating out, holidays, and shopping sprees. Rob gathers anonymous data from his clients to build a picture of what UK hair and beauty businesses are experiencing, which show the following trends: salons are busy, with over two thirds of appointments being filled; smaller businesses are busier but have trouble attracting staff; average salon bills and client prices are increasing, especially in larger salons; client habits are changing and they prefer booking online, and salons that offer online booking are thriving; cancellations and no shows are still an issue; with the cost of living crisis, and clients are shopping around for the best prices and value, which influences whether they remain at a particular salon. Rob offered to work with the APPG to tackle these challenges that Rob has identified as the trends that remain problematical for the hair and beauty sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, I join the <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/children/quick-guides/summer-reading-challenge/">Summer Reading Challenge</a>. In 2022-23 The Reading Agency reached over 2.17 million people, including 1.12 million children. People read over 13.5 million books, e-books, and audiobooks, and borrowed over 12.9 million books from libraries. The Reading Agency gifted 256,825 books, e-books, audiobooks and reading resources to people who experience barriers to reading. By taking part in the reading challenge, 3-in-4 children, young people, and adults enjoyed reading 77% more, and increased reading confidence by 71%.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To celebrate International Domestic Workers Day, I attended the Parliamentary event organised by <a href="https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/">The Voice of Domestic Workers</a>, to call on the UK Government to ratify the Domestic Workers Convention, which promotes decent work for domestic workers and recognises their invaluable contribution to the global economy. Its key provisions are: minimum wage; equal treatment re hours, overtime, compensation, daily and weekly rest of at least #24 hours; paid annual leave; access to tribunals and courts; social security, protection from abuse, harassment and violence; labour inspection, enforcement and penalties. Estimates from the International Labour Organisation ILO in 2019 put the numbers of domestic workers at 75.6 million globally, of whom 76.2% are women. They work long hours for low wages and are often excluded from Labour and social protections. They suffer abuse, forced Labour, domestic servitude, and failure to be paid the minimum wage. The Voice of Domestic Workers (formerly Justice 4 Domestic Workers) is an education and campaigning group, calling for justice and rights for the UKs thousands of foreign domestic workers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I took part in Flavour Perception Testing, which is an early screening process for Alzheimer’s disease being developed by The University of Warwick and University Hospitals for Coventry and Warwickshire. It was a pleasure to meet Professor Alan Chalmers of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/">Warwick Manufacturing Group</a> (WMG) at University of Warwick, who explained that the profile of the ability to taste and smell as a means of early detecting the possibility of Alzheimer’s so that the person can be referred quickly for the tests that will actually confirm diagnosis. The inability to distinguish flavours is an early sign of Alzheimer’s. Every 5 seconds someone is affected by Alzheimer’s, but there is no current means of early and widespread screening. The new drugs that are coming onto the market which can reverse Alzheimer’s but only when it is in its earliest stages, means that early detection is absolutely vital. Parliamentarians were given 2 drinks to taste and had to decide which was the sweetest, and if you correctly identified the sweetest flavour, it was a sign that they were symptom-free for Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a supporter of <a href="https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/">Guide Dogs UK</a> for many years, and it was a pleasure to meet my friends from <a href="https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/guide-dogs-cymru/">Guide Dogs Cymru</a> who are blind or partially sighted and who had made the long train journey from Wales to Westminster on a very hot June day. It was so hot that they had to leave their support dogs at home, but the wonderful staff and volunteers from Guide Dogs Cymru travelled with them to look after them, and make sure that they arrived safely. It is so important that adults, young people, and children who have lost their sight or are partially sighted, do not lose their freedom as well. I repledged my support to Guide Dogs UK in its campaign to stop people who are blind or partially sighted being refused access to premises, services and some modes of transport when they are accompanied by their support dogs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was proud to meet representatives from <a href="https://www.akt.org.uk/">Akt</a>, which is a charity that works with 16-25 year olds in the UK who identify as LGBTQ+ and are experiencing homelessness or struggling with their housing situation. Akt believe that there are 5 important reasons for raising awareness of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness: over 24% of young people experiencing homelessness identify as LGBTQ+; 77% of young people Akt support cited family rejection and abuse after coming out or being outed; they will often be asked to “evidence” that they have been kicked out, but they cannot, or ask to return to abusive relationships; nearly 25% are not aware of available support services, and only 33% sought support from their local authority whilst homeless; only 44% of local authorities and housing associations have received training on LGBTQ+ inclusion and LGBTQ+ homelessness. Akt is calling for the UK Government to implement a national cross-department strategy to end youth homelessness including: prevention, focusing on schools, families and councils; housing; and financing. Improve monitoring of gender identity and sexuality in housing and homelessness services. Build safe and inclusive housing and homelessness services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.tsb.co.uk/fraud-prevention-centre/fraud-refund-guarantee/">TSB Fraud Guarantee Refund</a> event again this year to listen to the progress that TSB has made since it implemented its refund policy to all victims of fraud cases at TSB in 2019. It was positive to hear that TSB has refunded 97% of all claims, but concerning that Meta companies account for 80% of fraud cases at TSB within the three most common fraud categories – investment, impersonation, and purchase fraud. TSB are campaigning for media companies to protect its customers and take financial liability when their safeguards fail.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was an honour to meet the Ukraine Diplomat, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasyl_Filipchuk">Dr Vasyl Filipchuk</a>, for a confidential briefing on the current situation in Ukraine and for an overview of the short-term and long-term challenges plus the strategic issues facing Ukraine during Putin’s attacks, and rebuilding infrastructure when the war is over. Dr Filipchuk is a foreign and security expert at Ukraine’s oldest think tank – the <a href="https://www.icps.com.ua/en/">International Centre for Policy Studies</a> (ICPS). Vasyl has worked in many previous roles, including the Ukraine Government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet Ministry of Ukraine, and was spokesperson, political director, EU director general in the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine, and the EU director at the Secretariat of the Ukraine Government. In 2014, Vasyl founded his own media holding – Apostrophe – which included TV, internet media, and social platforms, as well as consulting companies which specialise in communication media, business intelligence, and crisis management.</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about some local events and other matters.</p>
<h2>Ewell Village Consultation</h2>
<p>Firstly, some of you will be aware that there has been a long-running debate about how best to improve the centre of Ewell Village. After extensive discussions between local residents and businesses, councillors and the County Council, Surrey has launched a consultation to seek views about three different potential options for the village.</p>
<p>The proposals are pretty wide-ranging, and it is important that everyone in Ewell gets the chance to give their views about the options, and indeed can suggest things that might be done as well or instead. You can find details of the consultation by following this link.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.surreycc.gov.uk/2023/06/01/ewell-village-residents-invited-to-have-their-say-on-the-future-of-their-village/#:~:text=Ewell%20residents%20are%20being%20asked,of%20drop%2Din%20events%20scheduled">https://news.surreycc.gov.uk/2023/06/01/ewell-village-residents-invited-to-have-their-say-on-the-future-of-their-village/#:~:text=Ewell%20residents%20are%20being%20asked,of%20drop%2Din%20events%20scheduled</a>.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I am a little late to alert you about the drop in events, but you have the whole of June to make your views known.</p>
<h2>Charities Fair – Friday 23rd June</h2>
<p>For those of you who are looking for an opportunity to volunteer for a local charity, a reminder that my latest Charity Volunteers Fair is being held at St Paul’s Church, Howell Hill, between 4pm and 6pm on Friday June 23<sup>rd</sup>. For those of you who do not know the church, it is beyond Ewell East station on the road to Cheam.</p>
<p>Please do come along. There will be a wide range of local charities presenting what they do and looking for help.</p>
<h2>The Horton Arts Centre</h2>
<p>The Horton Arts Centre – Epsom’s beautifully renovated former chapel – has asked me to tell you that it is celebrating being open for one year. The award-winning heritage venue is planning a wide range of performances, courses and events this summer and the café-bar is open all day Tuesday to Saturday plus every Friday night.</p>
<p>A free photography exhibition by Epsom Camera Club is now running until 17 June and highlights coming up include a series of authentic Spanish classical music and dance concerts, performed in the round, 18-19 July.</p>
<p>See their website for more details: thehortonepsom.org or call 01372 747662.</p>
<h2>Ewell Village Day</h2>
<p>And one more date for your diary. The organisers have asked me to let you know that Ewell Village Fair this year is on the 15<sup>th</sup>. It’s always a good day out. And many thanks and congratulations to everyone involved in Ashtead Rotary for organising another really good Ashtead Village Day on Saturday.</p>
<p>I hope you are well and have a good summer.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

    <title>To save lives, the Government must set new targets to tackle the ‘silent disease’</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/to-save-lives-the-government-must-set-new-targets-to-tackle-the-silent-disease/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As many people die from preventable hip fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes, Judith Cummins MP has revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Tuesday in the House of Commons, Bradford South MP Judith Cummins called on the Government to step up its game on bone fracture prevention and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith has been vocal on the issue of Osteoporosis, which affects half of all women and a fifth of all men over 50. It is characterised by a loss of bone density, leaving people vulnerable to breaks and fractures. Because symptoms often aren’t noticed until a serious break, osteoporosis has been called the ‘silent disease’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raising the issue in Parliament, Judith highlighted the shocking reality of the condition:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Many of these will be serious hip fractures, and as many people will die from these fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questioning the Minister, Judith asked why such a serious condition is so often overlooked in healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Can the Minister explain why not even one of the 63 key performance indicators set by NHS England for Integrated Care Boards sets a target for fracture prevention?’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Maria Caulfield MP, Minister for Women’s Health Strategy, thanked Judith for her longstanding work on bone health. The Minister also highlighted measures the Government is undertaking to tackle Osteoporosis:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘NHS England is expanding fracture services for higher risk women who do have Osteoporosis to prevent falls in the first place.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the Government’s claims to be stepping up fracture services, the limits of the current services mean that 74,000 preventable fractures will occur over the next five years, costing the NHS £665 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making fracture prevention a key performance target could lead to stronger delivery of these services, preventing unnecessary pain, giving patients the level of care they deserve, and saving vital NHS resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the exchange, Judith said that Government support for fracture prevention was still inadequate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Whilst Bradford offers a trailblazing service for those with Osteoporosis, this is not always the case nationally.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘The argument for investing in the prevention of fractures is clear: To save money and save lives, we need a government with the sense to invest in the future of women’s health in this country.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>

<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684233937.JPG" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Social Security Health Assessments System has Contributed to the Deaths of Claimants</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">Social Security Health Assessments System <span style="color:#06396a;">Has Contributed to the Deaths of Claimants</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>The cross party Work and Pensions Select Committee responsible for scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) policies, has published a damning report on the Government’s health assessments system which is used to screen whether sick and disabled people should have access to vital social security payments.</p>
<p>These payments provide financial support to a working age person who is unable to work because of their health condition or disability; the assessment for this is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and is for either Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work. In addition there is also the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment process to access support to cover the extra costs disabled people face because of their disability which are estimated at over £580 a month on average; this is for the Personal Independence Payment.</p>
<p>The report exposed the detrimental impact of the assessment process itself on the health and well being of claimants.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the Committee, Professor Ben Barr, from the University of Liverpool, was asked about research he carried out in 2015 which looked at the impacts of the WCA as claimants were reassessed to move onto Employment Support Allowance. His analysis estimated that across England, the WCA had caused an additional 600 suicides, 300,000 additional cases of mental health problems and a large rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over a nine-year period.</p>
<p>“We looked at whether it could be explained by other factors or other economic trends, but there was quite a unique pattern in the increase in mental health problems, and the most likely explanation was that it was due to the reassessment process”, he told the committee. He said it is difficult to assess improvements since this study as “there are no systems in place” to monitor the impact of the health assessments and the potential adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>A survey by the University of Kent last year found half of claimants who have been through the WCA process said it made their mental health worse. Dr Ben Baumberg Geiger, who led the research, told the committee: “It is not sufficient to say that this is a historical problem and that everything is fine now. If there was more transparency, it would be easier to know a bit more about it, but the evidence suggests that there are still major problems with the WCA that could lead to an increased risk of poor mental health.”</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth and a Member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee said:</p>
<p><em>“The evidence is clear – the current system is not fit for purpose. The DWP’s own figures show that <strong><u>274 people a month</u></strong> <strong><u>die 6 months after being found fit for work </u></strong>and <strong><u>60 people a month die 3 months after having PIP refused. </u></strong>These are poorly people not the shirkers and scroungers that some Conservatives refer to when discussing social security claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“We heard evidence during the inquiry that when people were being reassessed between 2010 and 2013, there were 600 additional suicides. In 2020, National Audit Office has said that the claimant deaths that the DWP had investigated were the tip of the iceberg. The current approach is contributing, directly and indirectly, to the physical and mental health harm of claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“Last year the Equality Watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, issued a Section 23 order against the Department of Work and Pensions over their discriminatory treatment of disabled claimants.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Government itself has effectively acknowledged a different approach is needed when they announced that they would abolition the Work Capability Assessments, something I have been calling for years, but the detail of the future process is too opaque and doesn’t provide reassurance. Given it will take place several years to replace, what happens until then?</em></p>
<p><em>“I remain deeply concerned about these health assessments but also about the punitive nature of the sanctions regime, introduced in 2012 and, once again, on the rise. </em></p>
<p><em>“I believe it is these social security policies, as well as the inadequacy of the social security support especially for working age people, and the dehumanising culture that claimants too often experience that collectively contribute to the adverse health effects is the It is so detrimental to vulnerable people especially, but to all people as well.</em></p>
<p><em>“Given the failure of the Government to make many of the changes recommended in our predecessor Committee in 2018, I hold little hope in them taking on board the improvements set out in the report.”</em></p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP welcomes school debaters to Downing Street</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2023/03/29/matt-warman-mp-welcomes-school-debaters-to-downing-street/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-4189 aligncenter" srcset="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png 300w, https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the visit &lt;strong&gt;Matt Warman MP commented&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith&lt;/strong&gt; who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

    <title>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd New Warehouse in Andover</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://kitmalthouse.com/2022/berry-bros-rudd-new-warehouse-in-andover/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=berry-bros-rudd-new-warehouse-in-andover" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was deeply concerned to read the decision taken by the Court in this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63313556">case</a>.</p>
<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p></div>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">Compensation package for Waspi women</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="213" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Labour has pledged compensation packages for millions of women hit by state pension age rises imposed by the Tories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a historic debt of honour to them.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
