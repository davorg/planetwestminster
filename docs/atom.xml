      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Graham Stuart MP, an energetic campaigner for the line for many years, has welcomed the completion of the Strategic Outline Business Case for reinstating the York to Hull rail link, known as the Minsters Line, and is asking for residents to let him know what the Minsters Line would mean to them.

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-84/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">My week in Parliament began when I called in to meet the wonderful Stonewall staff, and to pick up my Stonewall Rainbow Laces so that I could wear them during the Wales v England World Cup match taking place on Tuesday. I put them straight into my black trainers and wore them all week in Parliament, and I think I’ll carry on wearing them. By wearing rainbow laces I am so proud to support the LGBTQ+ community and those in Qatar in particular.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Universal Credit (UC) to listen to guest speakers discussing the issues surrounding UC and paid work. We heard from Henry Parkes, Senior Economist IPPR, Dr Kay Jones, Manchester Metropolitan University, Rosie Mears, Welfare Rights Advisor, and Sophie Howes, Head of Policy Child Poverty Action Group, who covered topics such as work coaches, self-employment and the Administrative Earnings Threshold, and research into employers and UC.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Human Rights Bill briefing delivered by Liberty and the British Institute of Human Rights (BIHR). On 22nd June 2022, the UK Government published a new Bill that would get rid of our Human Rights Act (HRA) and called it the “Bill of Rights”, but it is actually the opposite. It’s a “Rights Removal Bill” which signifies the latest step in plans to reduce the responsibility of the UK Government to respect, protect, and fulfil human rights which people rely on everyday across the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Bill of Rights was shelved on 7th September when Brandon Lewis was appointed Justice Secretary, at the start of November Dominic Raab announced his intentions to revive the Bill, after he replaced Mr Lewis. The Bill will be returning to the Commons in the near future, and it will leave no corner of our Human Rights Framework unaffected. If we lose our HRA we will no longer be able to rely on the rights and benefits it places on public bodies to uphold our rights, including economic, social, and cultural. As we enter a winter where people face the choice between heating or eating the last thing we need is the UK Government stripping away our most basic rights, protections, and limiting state accountability. We must continue to stand firm in protecting our Human Rights Act and amplify the voices who rely on its provisions every day and safeguard their human rights, and the human rights of all of us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an officer of the APPG Trophy Hunting I was honoured to meet the legendary Dr Jane Goodall at our event to celebrate the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-11-25/debates/56FB7231-0EE6-4137-950E-73DCF580D646/HuntingTrophies(ImportProhibition)Bill">Second Reading of the Trophy Hunting Private Members Bill</a> (PMB) on Friday 25th November. It was good to catch up with my friend, fellow vegan, and long time animal rights campaigner Peter Egan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was an absolute pleasure to meet with Ali Hood of <a href="https://www.sharktrust.org/">Shark Trust</a> who has helped me with my PMB to ban the import and export of detached shark fins into and from the UK. Ali has been Director of Conservation since 2002. Sharks Trust is a charitable organisation founded in 1997, and based in Plymouth. It has been campaigning at an international level for many years to safeguard a future for sharks, skates, and rays, through science, education, influence, and action. Its priorities are species protection, fisheries management, and responsible trade. Ali works to secure protection and management for vulnerable species, develop sustainable fisheries, holding governments and industries to account – tackling them when they fall short, but praising them when they achieve. Ali played a big part in 100 additional sharks and rays being listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) at their COP19 conference in Panama. The previously unlisted species includes requiem sharks such as reef sharks, tiger sharks, blue sharks, hammerheads, guitarfish, and freshwater stingrays. The listing of requiem sharks is revolutionary because they represent the vast majority, 85-90%, of fins in global trade.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG for Sepsis EGM was called because the vice chair Mike Wood MP has been promoted to serve in the UK Government, and the rules preclude him from continuing as an officer of an APPG. We are delighted to welcome my dear friend John Howell MP as Mike’s successor. Massive thanks to Mark Tami MP, Jess Morden MP and Ed Davey MP for giving up their valuable time to attend the EGM.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I dropped into the International Day of Persons with Disabilities event and met representatives from Disability Rights UK. The erosion of disabled people’s human rights has been rapid and severe, and they have been hit the hardest by a decade of austerity. Disabled people faced disproportionate deaths and barriers during the pandemic, and now fear how they will survive the winter during the cost-of-living crisis. As I have mentioned, Raab’s Bill of Rights will severely impact disabled people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was really good to catch up with my old friend Mike Steele, who used to be a reporter with ITV Wales many years ago. Mike runs the London Marathon MPs Team, and has run in the race many times.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Business in the House included a vote on Tuesday on the Privilege Motion which was carried by 371 to 16 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday afternoon, the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-12-07/debates/A2855E4B-2778-490A-B649-07BED474AE3C/FinancialServicesAndMarketsBill">Finance Bill at Committee Stage</a> was debated on the floor of the House, and divisions were called on the following clauses:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green voted for their amendment to Clause 5 which would require HMRC to contact every individual who become liable to pay standard tax or move from standard to higher rate, and how much additional tax they will have to pay as a result. The official opposition abstained, and the amendment was lost by 55 to 285 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The opposition voted against – that Clause 5 Stand Part of the Bill. UK Government Clause 5 sets out the personal allowance at £12,570 and the basic rate limit at £37,700 for 2026-27, and 2027-28,  but was lost by 210 to 285 votes. The official opposition stated that these freezes to tax allowances will mean that an average earner will pay over £500 more income tax per year by 2027-28, and so opposed that this clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The opposition voted for New Clause 2 which would require the Chancellor to publish an assessment of estimated revenue from the oil and gas profit levy In financial years 2021-22 to 2027-28, if the rate was increased to 38%, the amount of additional investment expenditure reduced to 0% by this Act, but was defeated by 212 to 292 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">New Clause 3 would require the UK Government to publish an assessment of the effectiveness of R&amp;D tax reliefs and plans he has to further reform R&amp;D tax reliefs, and was supported by the opposition but was defeated by 212 to 290 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The opposition voted against 3rd Reading, but it was carried by 280 to 205 votes. The Bill was sent to the House of Lords where it will go through similar stages, before being sent back to the Commons.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hirfynydd Action Group meets weekly at Saran Chapel in Crynant and I accepted an invitation to listen to their concerns about the proposal by EDF to erect wind and solar energy farms on the mountain. Although EDF had held consultations in venues in the Dulais Valley, the Action Group felt that they had many questions that had not been addressed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My Constituency Surgery was busy with Neath constituents who face many different challenges in their professional and personal life. I have taken up every issue on their behalf, and I thank my staff for all their work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I went to the Advent Two Service at St David’s Church led by Reverend Coles. It was a pleasure to meet with friends. Advent is a wonderful time in the church calendar with lots of events in the run up to Christmas Day. The Messy Church Christmas Party will take place on Saturday 17th December from 2-4pm in ADS School Hall. The Nativity Scene will be displayed in the Greyhound Trust Charity Shop window. Please see <a href="https://twitter.com/neathbenefice?lang=en">Neath Benefice Social Media</a> for more details of events.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of the Petitions Committee, Elliot Colburn MP opened the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-12-05/debates/E75644F3-E825-4054-9934-D62211BA8BBC/AnimalWelfare(KeptAnimals)Bill">debate on e-petition 619442</a> on the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill which received over 107,000 signatures, and states that “hundreds of thousands of people have signed numerous petitions calling for actions that the UK Government has included in the Kept Animals Bill. The Government should urgently find time to allow the Bill to complete its journey through Parliament and become law. The Government promised to find time to take this Bill through the next Parliamentary stages so that it can receive Royal Assent and become law, yet we are still waiting. For the Government to live up to its claims to be leading the way in animal welfare there must be no further delay to this legislation becoming law.” The Bill was introduced into the Commons in June 2021, received second Reading in October 2021, and passed through committee in November 2021. It was carried over, and reintroduced in May 2022. The Bill is awaiting its report stage, but the Government have stated many times that it will do so when parliamentary time allows. The Bill is important in that it addresses many commitments to animal welfare made in the Conservative Manifesto 2019. There were many MPs from all Parties who spoke in support of different animal welfare campaigns and for bringing back the Bill without further delay. I asked whether the measures to reduce puppy smuggling would also have a positive effect on online puppy sales which are the subject of a campaign otherwise known as Reggie’s Law. On 13th December 2021, I <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-12-13/debates/D196CD0F-7995-4A9B-B120-1998106AF3B1/OnlineAnimalSalesRegulation">presented E-petition 587654</a> which stated that many animals are sold online and asked for the UK Government to introduce regulation for all websites where animals are sold, so that websites should verify the identity of all sellers, and for pictures of young animals with their parents be posted with all listings. The petitioner Richard bought a 12 week old Labrador puppy through a reputable website, but unwittingly contributed to illegal puppy farming, and Reggie died from parvovirus two days later. Richard went back to the house where he’d bought Reggie but the seller had vanished. The microchip number for Reggie did not match the documentation and was in fact registered to Dublin, so Richard believes that Reggie was illegally shipped into the UK. Richard set up “Justice for Reggie” to raise awareness and campaign for UK Government regulation so that people who buy puppies online do not suffer the agony that Reggie and Richard endured.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the freezing temperatures, many Parliamentarians and staff turned up to watch Mr Speaker switching on the lights on the Christmas Tree in New Palace Yard. The Speaker’s Chaplain and Lord Speaker attended, and the ceremony was accompanied by carols from the excellent Rock Choir.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-12-05/debates/E155684B-DEB0-43B4-BC76-BF53FEE8086A/OnlineSafetyBill">business in the Chamber</a> was the return of the Online Safety Bill, and I listened to the debate, but parliamentary protocol dictates that I am unable to vote on any stages of this Bill, because I co-chaired it at its Committee Stage. The opposition tabled clauses to strengthen the measures in the Bill, and pressed for a vote on New Clause 16 and was defeated by 242 to 308 votes, New Clause 17 and was defeated by 238 to 311 votes, New Clause 28 and was defeated by 240 to 312 votes. The opposition voted against Programme Motion No 4 and was defeated by 216 to 314 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Western Gateway APPG co-chaired by Jess Morden MP and Sir Robert Buckland MP. The new Director of Western Gateway, John Wilkinson, attended for the first time. I spoke to John before the meeting and was encouraged to know that he has already met with Simon Jones, CEO of the Global Centre of Rail Excellence (GCRE) which is being developed in Onllwyn in my Neath constituency. Chair of Western Gateway, Katherine Bennett, and former Acting Director, James Cooke, gave updates on the future work programme following Western Gateway very disappointingly not securing the Severn Edge bid to bring the UK’s UKAEA’s STEP Programme to the Western Gateway area. But it was encouraging that Western Gateway are discussing with partners an appropriate legacy for the Severn Edge Oldbury and Berkeley sites.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Western Gateway will also focus on its strategic rail vision, and will build on the letter recently sent to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Michael Gove, offering support in shaping the knowledge-intensive cluster discussions, Western Gateway Partnership and Knowledge-Intensive Clusters, which was co-signed by the Vice Chancellors of the G4W Universities demonstrating the potential strength of the partnership.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I invited the APPG members to visit the GCRE, and offered to facilitate a joint APPG meeting with the APPG for Rail in Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amnesty International UK held its Human Rights Day event and I spoke with campaigners for Chow Hang-Tung, a courageous human rights lawyer and activist who asked people on social media on 4th June 2021 to light candles in memory of protesters killed in the Tiananmen Square crackdown. She was sentenced to 22 months for her activism and faces further imprisonment for allegedly endangering national security through her peaceful actions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, is a self taught Black Cuban artist who paints, dances and wears pink. On 11th July 2021, he posted a video saying he would be joining one of the largest demonstrations in decades in Cuba. He was arrested and taken to Guanajay maximum security prison where he remains with declining health.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, Dorgelesse Nguessan was a hairdresser who had never attended a protest, but in 2020 concerns about the economy led her to protest. She was arrested and charged with “insurrection, assembly, meetings and public demonstrations” and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For over 20 years, Amnesty’s “<a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/write-rights-2022-get-started">Write for Rights</a>” campaign has transformed the lives whose rights have been violated. Millions of people from all over the world have taken part sending messages of hope to those who have been abused calling on those in authority to stop these abuses. The 2022 campaign is calling for justice for those like Chow, Dorgelesse, and Luis, who have paid a great price for speaking out.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pleasure to meet my old friend Andrew Shelly, who was Operations Manager for the Squash Rackets Association (SRA) from 1976 to 1994 and managed 20 British Open Tournaments. Andrew left the SRA to run the Women’s International Squash Players Association and grew the professional women’s tour by 300% during the 15 years he was in post. Andrew became the CE of the World Squash Federation in 2010 and stood down in 2019 after failed bids to get Squash into the 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024 Olympic Games. Andrew set up and is now Director of the World Squash Library, to “give back” to the sport he loves. The WSL is based at Southgate Squash Club and has already collected information about players, events, courts, equipment and rules going back to the start of Squash in the 1850s. Andrew brought another friend Helena, whose first job many years ago was with the SRA. The quest for Squash to be included in the Olympics continues, disappointingly it has not made the Los Angeles Olympics 2028. Brisbane was recently announced as the venue for the 2032 Olympics, and Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, recently stated that he would like to bid for London to be the venue for 2036 or 2040. Andrew has helped me in the debates I’ve held in Parliament to raise awareness of the enormous positive benefits that squash can play to mental and physical well being, and to urge for its inclusion in the Olympics. We reminisced about squash from the 1980s up to present times, spoke about old friends that we are still in touch with, and those that we should make an effort to contact again. The squash world is one big family and our friends are friends for life. Before the first lockdown in March 2020 we had planned to hold a Parliamentary event to raise awareness of squash with some of the top professional players on hand to speak with MPs and Peers about the wonderful game, but unfortunately we had to cancel it. We plan to try again in March 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met Nicky Ryan, Welsh Lead on the National Board for the <a href="https://www.polfed.org/">Police Federation of England and Wales</a>, at their Christmas Reception. Nicky told me of the many challenges facing police officers including: staff recruitment, staff retention, staff shortages, mental and physical work stress, poor pay increases, low morale, inflation, and the cost of living crisis. Many officers are leaving the job for one or more of these reasons. Nicky and I will be meeting again in the new year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the APPG on Music, I supported my great friend Kevin Brennan MP Cardiff West in his <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-12-07/debates/40B0DA98-9C61-4FFF-AB48-25692D573488/SongwritersAndComposersRemuneration">Westminster Hall Debate about remuneration for musicians and composers</a>. Kevin is a member of the Ivor’s Academy, PRS for Music, the Musician’ Union, chair of the APPG on Music, and guitarist, vocalist and founding member of the group MP4. Kevin spoke about three challenges for songwriters and composers, and asked the Minister to consider the recommendations set out in the Select Committee on Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) groundbreaking report on the economics of music streaming; composer buyouts threats to the future pipeline of songwriters and composers; and artificial intelligence (AI) and the implications of the data mining of musical works. I intervened and asked Kevin whether he agreed that the proposed text and data-mining exception to promote AI would remove the need for a licence to reproduce copies of original works, and therefore would take away any opportunity for performers and creators to be remunerated for their talent and work? Furthermore, because there is not an opt out for performers and creators, it will have a severe detrimental effect on their creative personality, because in the future it will be done by a computer. Kevin agreed and stated that any tech company could freely data mine creative output, including musical works, using AI, not an exact copy, but a facsimile in order to commercially exploit it. The composer would not have the ability to give permission and the UK Government would be trampling on property rights, and urged the Minister to reconsider it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Minister for Science, Research, and Innovation George Freeman, who has responsibility for the Intellectual Property Office, responded on behalf of the UK Government and stated that songwriters and composers should enjoy a fair share of the value, but the challenge is to get a framework where it is a lived reality without unilaterally moving so hard and fast that it undermines the sector, and the DCMS Committee report underpins the UK Government’s approach. The IPO has established a working group on metadata and has made progress on a code of practice, and has also established a working group to develop a code of practice on transparency. The Minister has also established a small task force of officials from his and the DCMS department to ensure that they get reform of text and data-mining right. His preference is to encourage the music industry to move in the right direction, but will legislate if necessary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/how-you-can-help/campaigning/our-current-campaigns/open-doors/">Guide Dogs Open Doors</a> event to urge the UK Government to strengthen the law against access refusals. Guide dogs can be life changing, offer independence, mobility, and the chance to live life to the full. But being refused access to a shop, restaurant, cafe, or taxi because of their guide dog is a regular occurrence for people with sight loss. 81% of guide dog owners say they have experienced access refusal in the past, and 73% say this has happened in the past 12 months. Access refusals are almost always illegal and discriminatory under The Equality Act 2010. But taking discriminatory cases through court action is expensive, difficult, and places more stress on guide dog owners. The law needs amending to have: a clear process which is easy to follow; meaningful penalties for access refusals; and include clear requirements for businesses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called in to the charity <a href="https://www.matesinmind.org/">Mates in Mind</a> drop in hosted by my friend Liz Twist MP and met Sarah Meek of Mates in Mind, who briefed me on their campaign. The charity has conducted a survey, run on its behalf by Opium, which showed that – 63% of the public believe that the UK Government should be more involved in helping to solve the mental health crisis within construction – two construction workers die by suicide every working day. The charity has worked with over 650 organisations across the construction industry to break down barriers, create a positive culture around mental health, reduce stigma, and concentrate on preventative measures. The UK Government has set out its commitment to improving procurement processes, ensuring there are fair and transparent payment and contractual provisions in government construction projects and programmes in the Construction Playbook, nevertheless, as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consultants all come under pressure to deliver construction projects more efficiently and sustainably, procurement practices, programme and budgetary pressures put an ever-increasing load on those expected to deliver more for less, which leads to work-related stress and potential reluctance to admit the impact on one’s mental health. There are pockets of good practice but there is lack of consistency and priority for mental health alongside health and safety. The charity believes that the identified good practice should be mandated for the entire industry and a proactive model introduced across tendering frameworks to start changing the way in which the industry views mental health.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG for Disability and disability charity <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/">Scope</a> Cost of Living Crisis drop-in and heard from disabled people about the choices they will have to make this winter. I also discussed the recommendations in Scope’s recent publication “<a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/scope/media/files/campaigns/cost-of-living/scope-cost-of-living-report-november-2022.pdf">Do the Right Thing</a>” about the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve tabled some written questions to the UK Government’s Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, asking: to consider the potential merits of providing part of the Cost of Living Payment to those on means tested benefits his winter; and what assessment has been made on the adequacy of the Cost of Living Payments for disabled people not on means tested benefits and who have higher energy usage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Plus a written question to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, asking: what consideration he has given to the introduction of an Energy Social Tariff, and what plans he has to consult on this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My Christmas Card competition has now closed and I’ll be announcing the winner next week. Massive thanks to all those who have sent in their entries. It is always difficult to choose just one winner from such a great selection of wonderful ideas.</p>

  <title>MP puts forward legislation for councils to limit second homes in Cumbria</title>

  <id>http://timfarron.co.uk/en/article/2022/1438849/mp-puts-forward-legislation-for-councils-to-limit-second-homes-in-cumbria</id>
  <summary type="text">Last night in Parliament, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron put forward an amendment to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill to give councils new powers to restrict second homes.
The amendment was voted down by Conservative MPs by 321 votes to 172.

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Last night in Parliament, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron put forward an amendment to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill to give councils new powers to restrict second homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The amendment was voted down by Conservative MPs by 321 votes to 172.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">However the Government said they would introduce a consultation on changing planning use for short term lets which could let local councils set a limit on the number of holiday lets and Airbnbs in their area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In response to Tim, the Housing Minister Lucy Frazer said: <em>"I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for a speaking on this issue and indeed other issues on this topic.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">"We are committing to consulting on a change to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 to enable local areas to better control changes of use to short-term lets, change to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 to enable local areas to better control changes of use to short-term lets, if they wish.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">"We propose to consult early in the new year. Following that consultation, we hope to bring in some legislation, if that is the result of the consultation."</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Speaking afterwards, Tim said: <em>"Conservative MPs continue to have their fingers in their ears when it comes to the issue of communities being turned into ghost towns due to excessive second home ownership.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">"However I'm glad to see finally some movement from the Government on changing planning law to restrict the worrying trend of people being evicted from their home so their landlord can make a bigger profit by putting their property on Airbnb.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">"I'm massively grateful to everyone who has helped me campaign on this issue. While progress has often felt painfully slow, I'm glad ministers now look like they are prepared to act.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">"I'll keep on pushing until we get the change we need to save our communities."</span></em></p>

    <title>My Interventions in the debate on the Remaining Stages for the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2022/12/14/my-intervention-in-the-debate-on-the-remaining-stages-for-the-levelling-up-and-regeneration-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rt Hon Sir John Redwood MP (Wokingham) (Con)&lt;/strong&gt;: Can the Minister remind the House how the Government will stop developers gaming a local plan and getting permissions that are not within the local plan under some silly rule?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Frazer, Minister of State&lt;/strong&gt;: This Bill and the proposals that we are bringing forward through the revised NPPF will do exactly that. At the moment, in 60% of areas, building is through speculative development, not where communities want it. We want to streamline the local plan process, get those plans in place, where communities want it, and then we can start and continue to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rt Hon Sir John Redwood MP (Wokingham) (Con)&lt;/strong&gt;: Does the hon. Member not understand that the whole point about more local determination is that the local community ultimately has to say, “This is all we can manage and we cannot be overridden”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clive Betts MP (Lab)&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, I understand that, and that should be taken into account, as it can be at the local plan stage. The problem is that, if every local community decides that it does not want house building, we end up with not enough houses being built nationally. That is the simple reality of life. What I am saying is, yes, have the argument at the local plan stage, but all too often now, local plans get bogged down not with where the houses should be built or with the quality of the housing and the infrastructure, but with arguments over housing numbers, with developers and councils employing lawyers and consultants to argue with each other. That is what happens. If we can get agreement between the council and the Government and that is then accepted as the target for the way forward, that is a suitable way to do it, rather than the current endless debate and argument about numbers and calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to mention one other amendment, on environmental outcomes. One of the biggest arguments at local level is often on the environmental impact of development. There is great concern among local communities about the environmental impact and the fact that, when developers commission an environmental report, it is commissioned by the developer and paid for by the developer. Communities are often suspicious that the report produces what the developer wants to hear, rather than what the actual environmental impact is for those communities. My amendment 105 is simple: in future, the developer should pay, but the local authority should commission. In that way, we make it absolutely clear that environmental outcome reports on individual developments are completely independent, and that local communities can trust them. That seems to be a sensible suggestion. I hope that the Minister will accept it and move it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madam Deputy Speaker, I apologise for not arriving for the beginning of my right hon. and learned Friend’s remarks. On the third group of amendments, on nutrient neutrality, may I applaud the Government for the work they are doing in trying to ensure that water companies take full responsibility for their discharges into our waterways? This is an extremely important and powerful set of amendments, and I applaud her for that. In that context, and in the context of both community land auctions and the infrastructure levy, is it the case that water companies can be in receipt of both those sources of funding in the event that local authorities deem it an appropriate use either of the infrastructure levy or funds arising out of community land auctions? At present, they do not appear to be. Can they become statutory consultees on significant developments, which at present they are not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=4517"&gt;The Minister of State, Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (Lucy Frazer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for my right hon. Friend’s intervention, because I know he has done significant work on this issue. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced future funding from fines handed out to polluting water companies being invested in schemes for the benefit of our natural environment. I know he did a lot of work on that issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the infrastructure levy, water and waste water networks are covered by the broad definition of infrastructure, so the answer to my right hon. Friend’s question on that issue is yes. On statutory consultees, the Secretary of State can make changes to the list of statutory consultees through secondary legislation, and we will consult on whether to make water companies statutory consultees, and if so, how best to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-12-13/debates/bb716128-bee5-425d-bd8a-7f10bb2bf0e8/CommonsChamber#contribution-8267582C-C719-4AC2-A361-13A715268C32"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nottingham City Council budget savings consultation to launch on Tuesday 20 December</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/12/13/nottingham-city-council-budget-savings-consultation-to-launch-on-tuesday-20-december/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p/>



<p>Nottingham City Council is to launch a consultation on 20 December on savings proposals to balance the budget for 2023/24.</p>



<p>If accepted at the council’s Executive Board next Tuesday, the proposals would go £29m towards filling the budget gap of £32.2m – meaning a further £3.2m will need to be found by February.</p>



<p>The council must set a balanced budget by law – but will not discover until after the consultation is launched funds will be allocated to Nottingham in its final allocation of the Revenue Support Grant. The amount given to the city has fallen from £126.8m a decade ago to £26.7m last year. This is the equivalent of £694 less this year for every household in Nottingham.</p>



<p>As well as the inflation pressures, the council has needed to budget for an unfunded, nationally-agreed pay increase for hardworking council staff which comes without any additional funding from Government – though it is the least keyworkers deserve and represents a real-terms cut when inflation is considered.</p>



<p><strong>Cllr Adele Williams, Deputy Leader and Portfolio Holder for Finance in Nottingham, said:</strong></p>



<p>“When Rishi Sunak spoke at a Tunbridge Wells garden party during his campaign to be leader of the Conservative Party, he said: ‘I managed to start changing the funding formulas, to make sure areas like this are getting the funding they deserve because we inherited a bunch of formulas from Labour that shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas and that needed to be undone. I started the work of undoing that.’</p>

<p>“This is what levelling up looks like. The Tory Towns Fund goes to Tory towns. Places like Nottingham are drained of funds, and it is boasted about. We are not deprived: we are held back, limited by the decade of Tory austerity.</p>



<p>“Nottingham people, like many other communities in the UK, are not on a level playing field. Children starting their lives in low-income households find it harder to do well at school, harder to live healthy lives, harder to progress into well paid jobs. Our economy – and funding for local services – is rigged to benefit the most well off. We need, and deserve, better.</p>



<p>“Once again, we are consulting with the city on budget proposals to save millions. We began the financial year with a broadly balanced Medium Term Financial Plan but that has been blown out of the water by inflation.</p>



<p>“The brief but disastrous reign of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng exacerbated an already terrible situation for ordinary people and the impact of that will be felt in interest rates, rampant inflation and the escalating cost of living crisis that has seen more and more households falling into hardship.</p>



<p>“The government has shifted responsibility to local council taxpayers to fund statutory areas such as adult and children’s social care and the costs of homelessness. This is funded through both council tax and the adult social care precept, introduced in 2016 to make local people pay for the Conservative failure to fix the scandal of adult social care funding.</p>



<p>“Council tax is a completely unfair way to fund local services, and this can be seen most sharply in a city like Nottingham where high demand for social care sits alongside a very low local tax base where 80% of us live in band A or B households where it is harder to raise tax locally.</p>



<p>“The defunding of cities like Nottingham, which Rishi Sunak talked about, has further disadvantaged local people. The adult social care precept is an inadequate sticking plaster that costs local taxpayers dear but doesn’t fix the problem that the government said they themselves would address, back when Boris Johnson promised on the steps of Downing Street to fix adult social care. We are still waiting for that. Whilst we wait, Nottingham council taxpayers are hit by the cost.</p>



<p>“We have fought in the budget to protect and support the people of Nottingham and we will continue to do so. We are here to help residents, to protect them from decisions that the Conservative government have made; decisions that benefit those most well-off in society and not those most in need. When it is launched, please do take part in the consultation. We are serious about listening to your views, and we will be part of a consultation programme that will involve trade unions, the Disability Involvement Group, the voluntary sector as well as a range of neighbourhood events.”</p>

    <title>Tories seek to demonise NHS staff</title>

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;quot;During the dark days of Covid, it was the NHS which gave us hope, not ministers partying in Downing Street.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour MP Chi Onwurah says &amp;quot;the Tories seek to demonise the very NHS staff we clapped from our doorsteps because they voted to strike&amp;quot;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pPgbbckmEK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pPgbbckmEK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1602354516481003521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;During the dark days of Covid, it was the NHS which gave us hope, not ministers partying in Downing Street.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Minister claimed Tories weren&amp;#8217;t demonising NHS staff, just unions. But the NHS unions are made up of NHS staff, and his Government&amp;#8217;s legislation requires a majority vote on a turn out of at least 50%. Unions like Unison  &amp;amp; the RCN are representing NHS staff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HS staff are overworked, underpaid, without a proper workforce plan, scared for the safety of patients &amp;amp; forced to use foodbanks. I asked the Minister why he thinks staff we applauded during COVID don&amp;#8217;t deserve face to face pay negotiations with his Government?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, spent his weekend getting out and about meeting the winners and runners-up of this year’s Local Business Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Local Business Awards are a yearly competition, organised by Gwynne, which aim to showcase the best businesses around. This year, more than 3,000 people cast their vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, an overall winner is chosen, as well as a winner and runner-up from each local ward. The results are announced on Small Business Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwynne has described these year’s awards as ‘very special’ and paid tribute to all of the local businesses who have gone above and beyond in tough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a pleasure to meet winners and runners-up over the weekend and say congratulations in-person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a huge honour just to be nominated, so I really hope that every business that received recognition feels like a winner. These awards have been very special this year. We’re going through tough times, and local businesses are the backbone of our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a huge well done to everyone involved, and to the public for making this year’s competition the most competitive yet. Here’s to next year!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>MARTIN WELCOMES HALF A MILLION POUNDS OF LOTTERY FUNDING AWARDED FOR GOOD CAUSES IN WEST DUNBARTONSHIRE</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>West Dunbartonshire’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has welcomed the award of over half a million pounds from the National Lottery Community Fund for a variety of local organisations across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven.</p>



<p>A total of £508,527 of National Lottery grant funding has been successfully secured by 17 local community projects across West Dunbartonshire.</p>



<p>Amongst the local voluntary and community groups celebrating a funding boost include:</p>



<p><strong>Lomond Radio Club,</strong> receiving a £8,075 grant to support the purchase of radio equipment and delivery of training for newcomers to amateur radio at their studio based in Renton.</p>



<p><strong>Golden Friendships, </strong>which secured £120,000 of funding for projects to tackle social isolation and loneliness experienced by older people and vulnerable adults across West Dunbartonshire.</p>



<p><strong>The Big Disability Group</strong>, awarded a grant of £138,610 to support its referral and signposting service for people with disabilities, long-term health conditions and their carers.</p>



<p><strong>ISARO Community Initiative, </strong>receiving a £149,591 grant to continue and develop its support work with people from ethnic minority communities in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire – including advice sessions, a befriending service for vulnerable people and volunteering opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>Dumbarton Shoto Budo, </strong>awarded a £3,775 grant for the purchase of team kit and participation in a national Shoto Budo martial arts training event.</p>



<p>Other local groups to secure National Lottery grants include: Cahonas Scotland, Castlegreen Allotments Association, Clifftop Projects Cic, Faifley Upcycling, Flourishing Faifley, Food for Thought SCIO, Healthy Heart Lifestyle Club, Renton Community Development Trust, Safari Bites and Scottish Kinship Care Alliance.</p>



<p>The funding awards have been warmly welcomed by local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes, who last week held an event in the House of Commons looking at how the cost-of-living crisis is impacting the voluntary sector across Scotland.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“West Dunbartonshire is home to some fantastic charities and local groups whose staff and volunteers work tirelessly to make our communities better.</p>



<p>“To secure more than half a million pounds of funding for so many good causes across West Dunbartonshire at this time is great news, and I congratulate all those involved.</p>



<p>“The cost-of-living crisis is a concern for the voluntary and community sector and the impact it’s having on our communities. The groups I’ve met with in parliament and locally in my constituency are facing pressures, but they’re determined to keep doing all they can to help.</p>



<p>“The National Lottery Community Fund offers a range of funding opportunities to put worthwhile community projects into action. I would encourage any interested groups to get in touch to find out what support is available.”</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up 12 December 2022</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/12/09/weekly-round-up-12-december-2022/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-12-december-2022" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>A busy week kicked off with a brilliant online event marking the 16 days of activism targeting violence against women and girls. I spoke in a Westminster Hall debate on this issue last week, and have been overwhelmed by the response online following my speech. At Monday’s event, I was delighted to welcome Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to an online “in conversation” event with some of my wonderful Labour women colleagues from across Bristol. </p>
<p>The discussion was engaging and passionate, and Yvette generous with both her time and her insight. As well as recognising the progress made in some areas, there was no underestimating the scale of the challenge that lies ahead to stem the epidemic of violence against women and girls that this country, like countless others, is currently in the grip of.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s meeting of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) focussed on lobbying and access. This followed on from last week’s Greensill report, where we focussed on lobbying. There are many things in common between Greensill and our recent meeting. The systemic failings of the 2014 ‘Lobbying Act’, from regulating the revolving door of business appointments to broader issues covering public appointments, the Ministerial Code and ethics watchdogs all need addressing. The session gave members the opportunity to hear how the EU regime for regulating lobbying operates, and to consider the extent to which some of its features could be adopted in the UK. </p>
<p>During the session, I was struck by quite how quickly the Greensill debacle has faded from public memory, despite the extraordinary shortcomings it exposed. It perhaps speaks to the number and nature of subsequent scandals that have engulfed this Government that a scandal involving a former Prime Minister exploiting his position for personal gain – albeit within the allowed parameters – is almost forgotten. </p>
<p>I was also able to speak in Labour’s Opposition Day debate on Tuesday, focusing on the ever-more-important issue of the NHS workforce. With retention of staff a real and growing problem, I repeated my call for the government to act sensibly and swiftly to address the challenges. With more than 80% of NHS staff homegrown, we need a step change in how we engage with local Further and Higher Education centres, a serious look at housing, and a meaningful move to empower local communities. Only then can we start to deliver a regional solution to the NHS workforce problems. </p>
<p>The issue of probity and common decency in public life that were the focus of PACAC returned in Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions. Keir Starmer, and a number of my Labour colleagues, all pressed the Prime Minister to explain quite how Conservative Peer Michelle Mone apparently came to benefit to the tune of £20 million from the sale of pandemic PPE by a company she helped establish. Despite an avalanche of evidence and revelations, the Prime Minister shamelessly skirted the issue, failing to answer a single one of the simple questions put to him on the issue.   </p>
<p>A reminder of everything that is good with our world, however, was to be found at the 90th birthday celebration for Lord Alf Dubbs. A man who has devoted himself for decades to the protection, betterment celebration of others, Alf remains a tireless advocate and campaigner for social justice. The affection and respect in which he is held could be seen by the number of colleagues in attendance, from all political parties and none. </p>
<p>This week also saw the 100 year anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Treaty coming into effect. The excellent House of Commons Library team published a great briefing note on the subject, which also provides some useful markers as to why we are still having some of the debates on the issue. You can read the report here. I was also pleased to see Keir Starmer meeting with Ivana Bacik, the leader of the Irish Labour Party. Their discussion focused on working together to build economic growth and prosperity, and underscored Labour’s commitment to shaping a relationship with Ireland with partnership and an understanding of shared challenges at its foundation. </p>
<p>Like me, Frances O’Grady is a feminist who is proud of her Irish roots. After almost two decades of service at the TUC, including an extraordinary tenure as General Secretary, Frances has been nominated to serve as a working Labour Peer. It was good to join with friends and colleagues to mark the end of her time at the TUC.</p>

<p>I started this week on a positive note by attending the launch of the Midland Hub at Birmingham Council House. It&#8217;s a plan to improve rail services across the region with more routes and increased frequency. Not entirely a new idea, I remember a version in the mid-90s when a young Councillor McCabe chaired Birmingham&#8217;s Transport Committee, but it&#8217;s an idea whose time has come and Midland Connect, the body responsible since 2015, have done a fine job in marshalling the business case and benefits.</p>



<p>We desperately need some good news on the rail front. The chaotic Avanti West Coast service has been given a six-month reprieve at huge public expense, West Midlands Railways require urgent improvement, and it seems the government is determined to ensure rail strikes over Christmas. If all those foreign rail shareholders can receive their dividends, we can afford a better offer on pay and without strings that conjure up the bad old days of Railtrack, horrific accidents, and safety nightmares.</p>



<p>You&#8217;d think the government would give greater priority to transport, especially railways in a region like ours. The evidence is that investment of this kind promotes economic growth and prosperity.</p>



<p>Support for the Midland Hub was in Boris Johnson&#8217;s 2019 manifesto but that was back when &#8216;levelling up&#8217; was the Tory mantra of the day. Since then, we&#8217;ve had Liz Truss and her economic wrecking ball which left the economy with an £80 billion black hole. The mantra now seems to be that we all must tighten our belts although some, like public sector workers, more than others. Even with all that tightening, and tax increases, the Chancellor still intends to make about £27 billion of public spending cuts.</p>



<p>I really hope the Midland Hub is not a casualty of this new austerity because it&#8217;s a value for money project.</p>



<p>So come on Rishi, what we want for Christmas is the government to treat railways seriously. Make the Midland Hub a reality and authorise a genuine offer to resolve the dispute. The public deserves it, our region needs it, and our economy is crying out for it.</p>

    <title>Isles MP urges pensioners not to miss out on £324 cost-of-living grant</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/12/08/isles-mp-urges-pensioners-not-to-miss-out-on-324-cost-of-living-grant/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is urging all pensioners on low-incomes to make sure they’re signed up for Pension Credit to ensure they receive a special cost of living grant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the Tory-made cost of living crisis continues the Mr MacNeil MP has warned households could miss out on the vital payment if they don’t apply soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, the UK Government originally announced a Cost-of-Living Payment to be paid to those in receipt of Pension Credit and other qualifying benefits.&amp;nbsp;To be eligible for the payment, an older person must have been entitled to a Pension Credit payment (or later found to be entitled to a payment) between 26 August and 25 September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applications for Pension Credit can be backdated by three months &amp;#8211; those who begin the claiming process by Sunday 18 December and are successful can be eligible for the second Cost-of-Living Payment of £324.00.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applicants can begin their application 4 months before they reach pensionable age and apply anytime afterwards and can do so online, by post, or over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Mr MacNeil said:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As the Tory-made cost-of-living crisis continues to ravage household finances, more and more people are set to see a reduction in their living standards, particularly those on lower incomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Increasing food bills, rents, mortgage payments and energy prices are all heaping on the pressure, and pensioners especially can be vulnerable this winter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pension Credit is money to which people are entitled, and I would urge all low-income pensioners to make an application today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local Update – Local Plan</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/6324-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to share with you my contribution to the debate about the Epsom and Ewell Local Plan which is now beginning its formal process. I expect the Borough Council to publish its initial thinking about the plan shortly.</p>
<p>Epsom and Ewell Borough Council is currently in the process of publishing and developing its local plan for the area for the next 10-15 years. Every local authority is obliged to do this, and to explain how it will meet housing need, look after its local economy and protect its local environment.</p>
<p>Each council has also prepared an assessment of local housing need, based on national guidance of how to do this.</p>
<p>We clearly have a need for new homes locally. There are too many young people who grow up or are educated here but cannot afford to remain in the area. And we have a serious shortage of social housing.</p>
<p>The housing assessment for Epsom and Ewell is though impossibly high, and I have been clear both nationally and locally that we need to use the provisions in the National Planning Policy Framework that limit what is expected from a local council. Very probably this involves a battle with national planning inspectors, but I am ready to fight that battle for our area.</p>
<p>But we do need to do all we can to meet the housing need, and I have proposed a comprehensive redevelopment of the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas of Epsom to achieve this without building all over our green belt.</p>
<p>Since that time I have had several conversations with the Borough, and also organised the preparation of a draft masterplan by a firm of architects with local connections.</p>
<p>The picture below gives an overview of the plan:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6326" src="http://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Masterplan.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="246" srcset="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Masterplan-200x146.jpg 200w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Masterplan-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Masterplan.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px"/></p>
<p>The plan involves the construction of a mixed use area of development, with retail and offices on the lower floors and flats above, with some terraced housing on the site as well. This kind of mix is typical of what is being done elsewhere. The buildings would be no higher than those already in and around the town centre.</p>
<p>The scheme provides a comparable amount of commercial space to the present plus nearly 5,000 homes. The plan would be to have car showrooms and parking areas built upwards rather than across large areas of parking as at present. But over time I would expect the commercial space to attract more creative businesses, given the presence in Epsom of the University of the Creative Arts which is now one of the country’s leading institutions of its kind. It would also aim to provide more homes for younger people rather than simply building more executive homes on open land. My worry is that developing the green belt is an easy option for the Council. It is always more complicated to reorganise what has already been developed than to build on a green field, but in our area it is much better to take the more difficult approach.</p>
<p>I hope this plan serves as a route for Epsom and Ewell Borough Council to plot a different way forward and protect our open spaces.</p>
<h2>Epsom and Ewell Energy Efficiency Scheme</h2>
<p>And just a couple of updates about the Energy Crisis locally.</p>
<p>Firstly a reminder that if you do not need your £400 rebate from the Government and are happy to use it to support the Epsom and Ewell Energy Efficiency Scheme, being organised with the Foodbank and Citizens Advice in Epsom to help those struggling with their bills, you can do so via this link.</p>
<p><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/98eeCRO3xsv5ggnEf9CRxP?domain=justgiving.com">https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></p>
<p>Both organisations cover a wider area including Epsom Downs, Ashtead and Leatherhead, and so if you are based there your contribution will also be a big help.</p>
<h2>Warm Space Schemes</h2>
<p>In addition two local churches have also asked me to let you know that they are running Warm Spaces schemes – where when the weather is colder those worried about their bills can spend a few hours in the warm.</p>
<p><strong>Ruxley Church</strong> is launching their Warm Welcome, Warm Space on Thursday 24<sup>th</sup> November from 11.30am to 2.30pm. As well as a warm welcome, people will be able to enjoy complimentary hot drinks, soup and a roll, read a newspaper or book, play a game, chat with others or simply sit quietly.</p>
<p>The church is in Ruxley Lane, KT19 0AF. People are welcome to drop in on any Thursday between now and the end of March 2023.</p>
<p>And the café at <strong>St George’s Churc</strong>h in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead is also joining the scheme. People are welcome to come and be in the café for a while or all day…….if they can buy one hot drink the team there will then offer them coffee/tea for free.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my November&nbsp;email newsletter. The focus is on yesterday&#8217;s Autumn Statement delivered by the Chancellor, with details on what this means for you, but there are also updates on local campaigns and on the ongoing issue of the Channel Crossings.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Autumn Statement:</h1>



<p>Yesterday, the Chancellor delivered the Government’s highly anticipated Autumn Statement. In which he detailed how the Government intends to restore economic stability and tackle inflation.</p>



<p>Like many countries around the world, the UK is facing profound economic challenges. Supply disruption caused by the world’s economies emerging from lockdown has been compounded by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and deliberate interference with Europe’s energy supply to create massive increases in the cost of energy. This has led to high inflation and high interest rates across many of the world’s major economies, and the UK is no different.</p>



<p>I welcome the proposals in the Autumn Statement. To achieve long-term, sustainable growth we need to grip inflation, balance the books, and get debt falling as a share of GDP. The plan presented by the Chancellor yesterday takes the tough decisions to face up to this situation without passing the buck onto future generations. What’s more, it protects the hard-working majority by enacting no headline tax increases, and protects the most vulnerable by maintaining the pensions triple lock and raising benefits in line with inflation – something I have personally been campaigning for. All while protecting and maintaining public spending for the next two years at the levels set out in 2021.</p>



<p>The plan involves a roughly equal split between tax rises and spending cuts, with the greatest burden falling on those who can afford it most. Specifically, the plan:</p>



<p><strong>Increases taxpayer funding for our NHS and schools by an extra £11 billion over the next two years.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; The Government will provide £4 billion in additional funding to schools and £7.7 billion in additional funding to the NHS and social care sector over the next two years. Prioritising the public services that matter most.</p>



<p>&#8211; £2–3 billion in additional funding for the NHS in each of the next two years so we can bring down ambulance waiting times, tackle the Covid backlog, and improve access to GPs. Also providing £2.8 billion next year and £4.7 billion the year after for adult social care, which aims to double the number of people leaving hospitals on time and into care by 2024, addressing unmet needs and boosting low pay in the sector.</p>



<p>&#8211; £4 billion in additional funding for schools over the next two years. We are increasing the schools budget by £2 billion this year and £2 billion next year to help schools with rising costs as a result of inflation. Which is more than Labour has pledged to give schools.</p>



<p><strong>Introduces no headline tax increases.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; The Autumn Statement raises £25 billion in additional taxes over the forecast period but there are no increases in the headline rates of tax. By targeting tax rises toward businesses, wealthier households, and the oil and gas industry, the Government has ensured that it can honour its manifesto commitment not to increase Income Tax, National Insurance, or VAT.</p>



<p>&#8211; Instead of raising rates, the Government is freezing personal tax thresholds for a further two years. There are also reforms to the Additional Rate threshold, so that a taxpayer who earns more than £150,000 will pay £1,200 more in tax per year.</p>



<p>&#8211; It is only fair that companies who have made genuine windfall profits as a result of the war in Ukraine make an additional contribution to pay for the support we have outlined. So from 2023, the Energy Profits Levy rate will rise from 25per cent to 35per cent and will continue until the end of March 2028. A 45per cent Levy will be applied to extraordinary returns made by electricity generators. In total these windfall taxes will raise £52 billion over six years. This is more ambitious than Labour’s proposal.</p>



<p><strong>Protecting and maintaining public spending.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; For the next two years public spending will remain at the levels set out in 2021 and then increase by one per cent in real terms each year until 2027–28.</p>



<p><strong>Supporting every household with their energy bills.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; The Energy Price Guarantee will continue to support everyone for another year. This winter, the price households pay for the energy they use will be capped, so that a typical household will pay £2,500. From April 2023, the price cap will rise so that a typical household will pay £3,000. The Energy Price Guarantee will then end in April 2024.</p>



<p><strong>Supporting the most vulnerable through maintaining the pensions triple lock and raising benefits in line with inflation.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; I have been publicly campaigning for benefits and pensions to be increased in line with inflation for some time now, and so was very pleased to see the Chancellor yesterday confirm that this would be part of the Government’s plan.</p>



<p>&#8211; To protect the most vulnerable, benefits will now be increased in line with inflation for 2023–24. More than 10 million households in receipt of working-age and disability benefits will see an increase in their benefit payments.</p>



<p>&#8211; The pensions triple lock will also be protected. Because of the difficult but necessary decisions the Government has taken elsewhere, the triple lock for pensions will be protected in full. This means that in April, the State Pension will increase in line with inflation, which is the biggest cash increase in the State Pension ever.</p>



<p><strong>Additional support for the most vulnerable.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Over £12 billion of additional targeted support is assigned to help the most vulnerable households. The Government will continue providing this year’s cost of living payments and next year it will provide extra one-off payments of £900 for the 8 million households on means-tested benefits, £300 to pensioners, and £150 for disability benefit recipients. The Government is also providing £1 billion of extra funding by extending the Household Support Fund for another year.</p>



<p>The OBR has confirmed that these plans will restore the public finances to a sustainable position and help reduce inflation and unemployment. And I look forward to engaging with my ministerial colleagues as these policies are rolled out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Remembrance Sunday:</h1>



<p>This year for Remembrance Sunday on 13th November, I was honoured to lay wreaths in Ripley and Kilburn in memory of those who have served our county, and in honour of those who are still serving. There are a multitude of remembrance services held across our constituency every year, so it is unfortunately impossible for me to attend all of them. However, every year I try to rotate which services I attend. This year it was a memorial service at Ripley War Memorial in the morning and another in Kilburn in the afternoon.</p>



<p>This has been a particularly important period of remembrance as we mark 40 years since the end of the Falkland’s war, and we commemorate the 255 British personnel who lost their lives in defence of the islands. Their courage and sacrifice must never be forgotten. Thank you to everyone who organised or supported the remembrance services and parades across Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Alfreton Solar Farm Update:</h1>



<p>On 21st October, I spoke at the public inquiry into plans from Kronos Solar to build a 50-megawatt solar farm between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. Many of you will remember that Amber Valley Borough Council’s (AVBC) planning authorities rejected the proposal last December, stating that the project’s scale and impact on the landscape outweighed any environmental benefits the site would provide. However, Kronos Solar have since filed an appeal to overturn the decision of AVBC and get the site approved, resulting in this enquiry.</p>



<p>I have been opposing the project on behalf of local residents and businesses throughout the process, a great many of whom have contacted me about the proposals. I very much support the expansion of our clean energy network, and in the right place a solar farm would be an asset. However, there are good reasons why this site was refused planning permission. We all want renewable energy expansion but not at any cost.</p>



<p>To begin with, much of the land is north facing, which means the site would need to be overly large. The impact on the amenity of local residents, the impact on the countryside area, and the impact on the various heritage assets is just too great. And that is before we consider Alfreton Park and Alfreton Park Community School, which looks after children with the very highest level of need, very close in the vicinity.</p>



<p>It is clear to me that this is a totally unsuitable site for this intensity of development. Frankly, I believe this proposal was not based on a thorough search for suitable land for a solar farm, instead, it looks to me to be based on a search for a suitable sub-station, with the proposal then trying to force some land to suit.</p>



<p>I will continue to keep residents updated on any developments. And at present, a decision is expected at some point in the next few months.</p>



<h1>Pollution and our waterways:</h1>



<p>I have recently welcomed the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs’ (DEFRA) plans to raise the civil penalty for water companies who pollute our environment by one thousand times, from £250,000 up to £250 million. I am hopeful that increasing the penalties the Environment Agency can enforce without a lengthy and costly court process will enable swifter and stronger action to be taken against water companies that illegally pollute our environment.</p>



<p>Many residents have contacted me about pollution and the use of storm drains in our sewage system. There has also been a great deal of misinformation circulating on social media regarding the Government’s campaign to address these issues.</p>



<p>Last year, the Government introduced the Environment Act 2021 which was a bill designed to tackle this problem and reduce sewage pollution ignored by previous Governments. When the Environment Act was going through Parliament the Duke of Wellington, a hereditary peer, introduced an amendment that would legislate the complete elimination of storm drains and therefore of storm overflow sewage into our waterways. This of course sounds admirable, and indeed is something I support in principle. However, this amendment came without a plan for how it could be delivered and how such a vast project could be funded.</p>



<p>Initial assessments suggested elimination would cost between £150 &#8211; £650 billion. To put those figures in perspective, £150 billion was more than the entire schools, policing, and defence budgets put together. Therefore, the Government did not support the amendment, and I did not vote for it. In my view, the last thing people wanted was for their water bill to go through the roof.</p>



<p>Twitter mis-informers seized this opportunity and claimed we had all voted in favour of water companies dumping raw sewage into our rivers. Which was totally false, and ironically punished the Government for actually trying to do something about the problem ignored by previous Governments.</p>



<p>With this most recent announcement by DEFRA, I am glad to see the Government continuing the campaign to improve the quality of our waterways. To hold water companies to account, and ensure any polluter pays for the environmental harm they cause, the Environment Agency must take advantage of these new powers.</p>



<h1>Illegal crossings over the Channel:</h1>



<p>Many of you have contacted me about the number of small boats illegally crossing the English Channel in recent months. I appreciate the strength of feeling on this alarming issue and want to outline my position to you and explain some of the challenges we face in tackling this problem.</p>



<p>The number of illegal entries into the United Kingdom via small boats crossing the English Channel is too high. It endangers the lives of those making the journey, puts money into the pockets of ruthless and brutal people smuggling gangs, and puts undue pressure on our existing asylum system as well as our public services. I remain committed to an immigration policy that welcomes people to the UK through safe and legal routes, and an immigration policy that allows us to provide asylum to those in genuine need. However, it is clear many of those arriving in small boats are not here in genuine need of asylum, and as a result, the current situation cannot go on.</p>



<p>One reason for small boat crossings increasing in frequency is the success the Government has had in tackling other forms of illegal immigration. Such as increased checks and security for lorries and freight crossing the channel, effectively reducing the number of illegal entries into the UK through these means, and increasing the number of people turning to small boats as a way to enter the UK. The problem that now presents itself is how to police and secure hundreds of miles of coastline 24/7.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Parliament passed the Nationality and Borders Act which overhauled our approach to asylum and illegal migration. The legislation includes fairness towards those who need our help, and in welcoming people through safe and legal routes, but firmness in tackling abuse of the system and expediting the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection. It is worth noting that Labour opposed this Act designed to toughen our immigration system.</p>



<p>Further to changing the law in this country, the Government has recently signed a joint UK-France arrangement on tackling small boat crossings in the Channel which includes a 40% increase in the number of UK-funded officers patrolling French beaches. The new agreement lays the foundations for deeper UK-French co-operation to tackle illegal migration. The arrangement means, for the first time, specialist UK officers will be able to observe French officials at work in control rooms and on the ground patrolling the coastline.</p>



<p>It is clear, however, that big challenges still lie ahead, and that the number of small boats currently crossing the channel is unacceptable. The Prime Minister speaking recently on GB News said that tackling illegal immigration was a huge priority for his Government, and that while the recent joint UK -France arrangement was a big step in the right direction there was more that needs to be done. I share the Prime Minister’s view, and will continue engaging with my ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues to make the case for further measures to reduce cross channel migration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP secures key commitment on visas for international GPs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/11/04/matt-warman-mp-secures-key-commitment-on-visas-for-international-gps/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li>In response to a debate called in Westminster Hall on Wednesday 2nd November, the Home Office agreed to look at how restrictions can be eased on international GPs working for the NHS.<br/>
• To deliver on this mission, the Minister for Immigration pledged to focus on ‘creative ways to resolve this challenge’, for example working with the sector to explore umbrella sponsors for international GPs and holding meetings with the sector to encourage more GP surgeries to become visa sponsoring practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Wednesday (2nd November), a Westminster Hall debate took place in which the House<br/>
considered visas for international doctors.</p>
<p>Matt Warman MP raised the point that under current legislation, GPs who have come from abroad to train in the UK are in a position whereby it is difficult to obtain employment after they graduate. This is mainly because, in order for a General Practice to hire an international graduate, they must be registered as a ‘sponsoring practice’. This requires a large amount of complicated engagement with the Home Office, both on the international GP’s behalf and that of the practice hoping to sponsor them.</p>
<p>Following a discussion of members from different parties, the Minister for Immigration, Robert<br/>
Jenrick MP, acknowledged the issues raised and agreed to look at ways to make this process easier. The Minister assured that the Home Office will ‘reflect carefully on the points raised’ and stated that he will ‘task Home Office officials to work with stakeholders in the sector to give greater consideration to the central question of whether there is a simpler way in which GP practices can apply for relevant visas.’</p>
<p>The Minister for Immigration also pledged to ‘ask my officials to work with the sector to see whether there is a way forward to create umbrella bodies, if there is mutual support on both sides’, as well as agreeing to run further engagement events with the sector to discuss the process of becoming a sponsor.</p>
<p>Commenting on the positive outcome of this debate, Matt Warman said: <em>‘The Minister has </em><br/>
<em>demonstrated more progress on this important issue in the commitment that he has made to us </em><br/>
<em>today than we have seen in some years … I am immensely grateful to all Members who have brought the issue to life, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Minister on the outcome of the review, which will make a real difference to our constituents, and to doctors up and down the country.’</em></p>
<p>Matt will continue to liaise with the Home Office, the NHS and the Royal Colleges in order to turn this promise into action as quickly as possible.</p>

    <title>ARTICLE: We need to get Scotland away from the horror show</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p><span class="searchHighlight">Halloween</span> is a time when scary things are supposed to happen. Ghosts, zombies, and ghouls are the order of the day. Westminster, however, hasn’t waited and has been playing out its own real-life horror stories within the crumbling walls of the Palace. Like some ghastly rickety fanfare, we’ve seen frightening and dangerous things unfold for years, picking up speed in the past weeks and months as breathless newscasters break the news of more dark intrigue and betrayal. Make no mistake, this may look like a rollercoaster ride, but it is a dirty old carousel with the same old dangerously unfit horses going round and round in ever-decreasing circles.</p>
<p>Of course, seeing the first Asian Hindu take office is truly welcome, but this isn’t a new broom with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The Tories have been in office for over 12 years. He’s the ‘Party gate Chancellor” who broke his own laws. He isn’t going to make things better; he’s continuing their long-running austerity programme, degrading public services and growing food bank dependency. As a Brexiteer, he happily wedded us all to the deeply toxic Brexit ideology harming our businesses, starving them of vital staff and turbocharging inflation – especially basic food items, now running at up to 60% more.</p>
<p>Westminster’s hall of mirrors also shows Labour wedded to “make Brexit work”. It’s a nonsensical stance that, hand in hand with their stated belief that the Tories are not deporting enough people quickly enough is a chilling reflection.</p>
<p>And just when you thought that one of the most frightening apparitions had been removed, it is back where it was. Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, whose dream is *not* of a brighter future for families, or a reduced skills shortage or even an end to people trafficking. No, it is her stated “dream and obsession” to see a flight take asylum seekers to Rwanda. Sacked only 6 days earlier having broken the ministerial code, she is back in the job tasked with upholding law and order and breached national security. She is back alongside colleagues at the helm of the ghostly pirate ship that is the Tory Government.</p>
<p>It’s a horror show we should be done with. The UK is substantially poorer than independent counties comparable to Scotland, with wider inequality, higher child and pensioner poverty and lower productivity. It is time for Scotland to choose a better path.</p>

    <title>Judith wants Bradford at the centre of the next Rugby League World Cup</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Judith Cummins MP has called on the government to use the power of sport as a ‘force for good’ to bring investment into Bradford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a debate on the contribution of the Rugby League world cup to culture and sport in the UK, Judith highlighted how sport is at the heart of local communities in her Bradford South constituency:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Week in, week out, local communities come together to support their clubs, their local kids’ teams and young players.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However, levels of investment and opportunities haven’t always matched the pride we feel in our towns and cities, but it’s moments like the world cup that will give communities the opportunities to stand tall and showcase where they live to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A compelling levelling-up bid has been submitted to government for a world-class stadium and training complex for elite sports with a Rugby League Skills, Training and Education centre in Odsal to serve the people of Yorkshire and the North. I can’t wait to host the world cup again in a decade’s time and be standing in our very own Odsal stadium in Bradford cheering England on!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding to Judith’s invitation to visit Odsal, Sports Minister Stuart Andrew MP said: “If I’m still in post by the end of the week I’ll still come but, if not, I’ll leave a note to my successor that their first trip needs to be to Bradford!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Cup’s world-leading social impact programme has invested more than £26 million in equipment and facilities, volunteering, mental health, culture and education, to transform clubs into hubs for their communities. And, for the first time, the men’s, women’s and wheelchair tournaments will be held concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study from the Sheffield Hallam University shows that investment in sport and physical activity gives back four times the investment in social value, equivalent to around £72 billion each year across the UK, improving people’s health and wellbeing, creating jobs and stimulating local economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith is fighting for Bradford to have its share:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the competition is over and the winning teams raise their trophies, it is only the start of the story for communities, not the end. With the Rugby League world cup in full swing, Bradford’s year as capital of culture in 2025, and Bradford’s bid for a world-class stadium and sports complex that will bring over a billion pounds of benefits to Bradford, now is the time to ensure that people of Bradford benefit from this legacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guide to Google Classroom distance learning in 2022</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/guide-to-google-classroom-distance-learning-in-2022/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It’s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it’s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren’t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one’s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn’t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they’re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we’ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don’t have face-to-face access to students. It’s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it’s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let’s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
