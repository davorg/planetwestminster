&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture will chart the continued dependence of the world on fossil fuels this decade. It will assess  the growing divide in approach between the UK and EU on the one hand and China, Russia and India on the other. It will ask how green are  various technologies recommended for the transition and warn  against compliant countries importing products with a high carbon content to lower their own CO2 scores. It will argue that the green revolution needs to be a popular revolution, driven by the wishes and needs of billions of consumers, just as the digital revolution has been. It will examine the way in which China and Russia might exploit their positions in industrial manufacture and oil and gas to shift the balance of world power.&lt;/p&gt;

  <summary type="text">On the floor of the House of Commons this morning, local MP Tim Farron urged Health Secretary Sajid Javid to invest in tackling cancer waiting times to save lives in the South Lakes.
The latest figures from NHS England reveal that in November 2021, just 63% of cancer patients in the Morcambe Bay area started their treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On the floor of the House of Commons this morning, local MP Tim Farron urged Health Secretary Sajid Javid to invest in tackling cancer waiting times to save lives in the South Lakes.</p>
<p>The latest figures from NHS England reveal that in November 2021, just 63% of cancer patients in the Morcambe Bay area started their treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament during a statement on Elective Treatment, Tim said: "<em>I</em> <em>am grateful for what the Secretary of State said about diagnostic hubs. Will he investigate personally why the planned hub for Westmorland General Hospital has been delayed until 2023?</em></p>
<p><em>"I am also grateful for what he said about cancer services more generally. He knows that there have been 60,000 missed cancer diagnoses over the last two years, and I am sure he knows that radiotherapy is a key factor in tackling the backlog.</em></p>
<p><em>"Is he aware that radiotherapy ought to be accessed by 53% of cancer patients in this country but is accessed by only 23%, and that, as a proportion of our cancer budget, funding for radiotherapy in this country is only a little more than half the average for similar developed countries?</em></p>
<p><em>"Will he therefore make it a priority to meet with the all-party parliamentary group for radiotherapy and look at our manifesto, so that we can work together to save tens of thousands of lives that would be needlessly lost otherwise?"</em></p>
<p>Responding, Sajid Javid said: <em>"The honourable gentleman raises a series of very important points, especially in what he said about cancer and radiotherapy.</em></p>
<p><em>"I believe he already has a meeting in the diary with Health Ministers, and I will look out for the output of that meeting.</em></p>
<p><em>"I agree with what he said about radiotherapy and the importance of investment in that, and there is a lot more investment. I referred earlier to the £6 billion extra capital budget, and a large part of that will be used for new diagnostics.</em></p>
<p><em>"I hope he also agrees with me that, as well as radiotherapy, we need to invest in the very latest cutting-edge technology for cancer care, such as proton beam therapy, which I saw for myself last week in London."</em></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>With a proper Plan.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>That’s why Attleborough Town Council and its many partners worked so hard to develop their Neighbourhood Plan, and why they are all working with Breckland Council on a ‘Future Breckland Plan’ to explore ways of breathing fresh life into the town so that it remains a wonderful place to live, work and visit.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>It was a pleasure to join Breckland officers and local councillors this past Friday to talk through this work in further depth – particularly with regards to the potential of transforming the Railway Station into a community/business hub with 5G wifi (a proper “gateway” to the town centre), as well as what will become of the current Banham Poultry site long term.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There is much work to do but I look forward to working with the team to ensure Attleborough’s Plan is brought to fruition in a way that benefits residents and businesses for many years to come.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “In one of the richest countries on Earth, no one should go hungry. Yet millions of people in the UK are struggling to feed themselves and put food on the table. Now, hard-working families are bracing themselves for the biggest drop in living standards in thirty years with petrol, food and energy bills are all skyrocketing. People have been left to choose between putting food in the fridge or money on the meter and while working families deserve security, prosperity and respect, they aren’t getting it. And, this isn’t just because of Covid or global problems.  </p>
<p>“Despite having years to prepare for Brexit, the incompetent Conservatives have failed to make Brexit work that’s resulted in labour shortages and supply chain disruption causing increased prices for basic food items.  </p>
<p>“Even before the Covid19 crisis hit, it was estimated that over eight million people in the UK regularly had trouble putting food on the table, half a million people used foodbanks and one million people lived in food deserts where it is impossible for people to buy healthy food. Trussel Trust figures show that the number of children eligible for free school meals has increased in Birmingham by 30% since 2016. But this unsustainable rate is entirely unsurprising when we have a government that have cut Universal Credit to 6 million families, increased National Insurance Contributions and have failed to tackle rising energy bills.  </p>
<p>“Tackling hunger was a founding cause for the co-operative movement, and for me, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, this remains as vital today as it did then. That’s why I am proud to stand alongside my Labour colleagues in calling for the Government to set out a national strategy for food including how it intends to ensure access to high quality, sustainable, affordable food for all and meet the Sustainable Development Goals to end hunger by 2030.” </p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"><span>Net Zero isn’t to blame for the energy crisis</span></div>
      
            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p dir="ltr">Philip Dunne writes for <a href="https://capx.co/net-zero-isnt-to-blame-for-the-energy-crisis/">CapX website</a></p>

<p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p dir="ltr">Last week’s news that energy bills will rise by on average £693 from April is of deep concern to my constituents. Such a steep rise will be felt by everyone, including middle-income households. Higher energy costs are already being felt by businesses in sectors well beyond energy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I’m particularly alarmed by impacts on the fuel poor. The agonising decision for any parent who has to choose between putting the heating on and feeding their child is a reality for far too many people in this country. Sadly following Ofgem’s announcement, and as a result of the hit to incomes during the pandemic, many more households are in fuel poverty and now face this invidious choice.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thankfully, the Government’s price cap provides some welcome protection against energy market volatility, but it can’t stop price rises forever if the global cost of gas is rocketing as it is now. With gas prices quadrupling in the last year, the cap had to rise, or else we’d see more energy companies going bust and leaving customers high and dry.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ofgem was very clear that the reason for the increase in the price cap was international gas markets. The UK is particularly exposed to global gas prices because of our high usage of gas for heating (85% of households) and power (35% of the generation mix). Ofgem’s analysis echoes what the energy industry has been saying for months. Countries across Europe are facing similar rises, including gas-rich Norway, as we are all part of an interconnected global gas market.</p>

<p dir="ltr">No government which supports open markets can hope to control the prices of internationally traded commodities. But despite the limited room to manoeuvre, the Chancellor has announced a targeted council tax rebate and a loan scheme to spread the costs of higher energy bills over many months. These measures are sensible, and will provide welcome relief to many of my constituents.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There has been much debate about the implications of this crisis for our energy policy. We have to be realistic that we cannot end gas use overnight. We will need it throughout the transition to net zero as a back-up to renewables on the power grid, as a fuel for industry, and for heating our homes while we shift to low-carbon heating. Nonetheless, we should seek to reduce our demand for gas as quickly as we can through building more clean energy, improving energy efficiency, and electrifying more of the economy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Government has made the right call not to cut green levies. These levies, which make up around 12% of a dual fuel bill currently, are contractual commitments which support renewable energy schemes and energy efficiency measures, helping reduce our reliance on gas. As electricity generation becomes increasingly sourced from renewables, in due course new levies should be switched from applying to electricity bills on to fossil fuels to incentivise decarbonised heating. But in the meantime current levies have perversely helped relieve pressure on bills in recent months, while the wholesale gas price has been so high – by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/government-b1997389.html">£160 million over the past quarter</a> according to a recent analysis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Although some commentators selectively highlight levies’ current share of electricity bills (25%), the reality is that they will soon make up only 8% of the dual fuel bill, as the wholesale cost component of the bill has shot up so much. The Government is in tune with the public by retaining these schemes, with a recent poll finding that just 13% of the public believe green levies are to blame for the current crisis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">These green levies are also a key driver of clean growth in our industrial heartlands – with vastly better job creation prospects than from fracking, now being promoted by some. Thanks to the support for clean energy through bills, businesses have invested tens of billions of pounds in new generation infrastructure and created tens of thousands of jobs in the supply chain, with many projects based in the North of England. Globally, renewables jobs are forecast to grow fivefold by 2050, while jobs in the fossil fuel sector will be around a quarter of their current level. It would be economic folly to try to buck this global trend.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rather than cutting schemes that pay for insulation for fuel poor households, as some have called for, we should be creating new incentives for people to insulate their homes, as both the Environmental Audit Committee and BEIS Committee have recommended. One of the reasons for our gas dependence is our leaky building stock. Perversely, people will be paying sky high gas prices for heating, far too much of which will escape through their roof.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Successive schemes, including most recently the Green Homes Grant, have not delivered as expected, not through lack of interest from consumers, but through administrative failures, short-term policymaking, and a poorly developed supply chain. While too late for the current crisis, I have called for the Government to come forward with a new, widely accessible energy efficiency scheme soon, so we can be better prepared for the next rise.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While there are no easy answers to gas price spikes in the short term, the net zero strategy provides the right long-term policy to move us away from gas. We won’t eliminate price shocks, but over time we’ll become less exposed. The Government is right to press ahead in implementing its vision for a net zero Britain.</p></div>

<p>This year’s theme for National Apprenticeship Week is ‘build the future’; reflecting on how apprenticeships can help individuals to develop the skills and knowledge required for a rewarding career, and businesses to develop a talented workforce that is equipped with future-ready skills.</p>
<p>I have always been a big supporter of Apprenticeships and the role they play in bridging the skills gap and there is nothing like hearing from young people about their experiences and their achievements. Here in my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, we are fortunate to have InComm Training and Business Services where I have met with employers and apprentices.</p>
<p>I congratulate our local employers who are willing to invest time and money into apprentices as the skills gap would be a lot wider without their continued investment.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My constituents already face long waits for overpriced bus services without the real-time data that Londoners take for granted, and now we hear that there will be further cuts to bus services. We urgently need a bus service improvement plan. Why will the Secretary of State not urgently support one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Last week there was a debate in Parliament on fraud and Government waste. The Government has an appalling record on both, repeatedly showing a lack of respect for taxpayer’s money.</p>
<p>The Chancellor himself has recently written off £4.3 billion in fraud from the coronavirus business loan scheme and two weeks ago, the Government’s own anti-fraud Minister resigned in protest, saying the Treasury “appear to have no knowledge or little interest in the consequences of fraud to our economy or our society”.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t have to pay for a Tory tax rise which adds to the cost of living crisis when billions are being leaked to fraud or wasted on government mistakes.</p>
<p>In the debate Labour called on the Government to allow the National Crime Agency to investigate these astronomical levels of fraud, and for them to come back with an update on the amount of taxpayer’s funds they’ve clawed back from criminals by the end of the March. You can read more about this <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-02-01/debates/151F8D55-94D6-408A-88CC-970D350C6F9D/TacklingFraudAndPreventingGovernmentWaste#contribution-535C7631-80EF-49ED-9F5D-2CDE8F13B297">here</a></p>
<p>Labour in Government will set up an independent Office for Value for Money to scrutinise government spending and ensure taxpayers’ cash is being spent well.</p>

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Bredbury Industrial Estate Expansion Planning Inquiry launched. This inquiry follows the decision of Stockport Council to reject the application of Quorum Estates for a large-scale industrial extension deep into the Tame Valley and on the border of Stockport and Tameside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have opposed this proposal for a number of years now and will continue to do everything I can to protect our Tame Valley from such a speculative and damaging proposal. I am taking part in this Inquiry as a Rule 6 Party. That basically means that I become an official party in the inquiry, and am given opportunity to present evidence, as well as to cross-examine the appellant’s (in this case Quorum’s) case. I am taking part as a Rule 6 Party with the express support of William Wragg MP, the Conservative representative for Hazel Grove. I made the point to the Inspector that it is unusual for an issue to unite so much condemnation from across the political spectrum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pride myself on being active and accessible on social media and public forums. This is so that constituents know what I’m getting up to, and what action I’m taking in Parliament and the constituency to serve the interests of the people I represent. It’s been difficult to do that this week because I’ve been stuck at my desk on the Inquiry. So, I thought it would be good to provide a brief update on how the Inquiry is going, what are the key points of dispute, and what we can expect next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Day 1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inquiry opened on Tuesday with opening statements. In mine, I set out why I am so against this proposal. I referenced the damage that it will do to the green belt, the impact it will have on traffic and congestion in Denton, and the lack of demonstrated need from the developer. Stockport Council (who are defending their decision to reject the appeal) also laid out their position. Stockport and I agree on most points, although there are some points of divergence, namely the impact that the proposal will have on traffic In Denton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_234868" style="width: 447px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234868" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-234868" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.48.12.jpeg" alt="" width="437" height="240" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.48.12.jpeg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.48.12-300x165.jpeg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.48.12-768x422.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caption-attachment-234868" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Above: Me giving my opening statement to the Inquiry on Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockport then introduced their witness, the planning professional Simon Wood. Mr Wood stated that he felt that the proposal resulted in a reduction in openness, both visually and spatially, and significantly breached several policies in the Stockport Unitary Development Plan Review, as well as the Stockport Core Strategy Development Plan Deposit and the National Planning Policy Framework. He considered the supposed economic and employment benefits of the scheme and concluded that the harm to the development plan policies were too great to be mitigated by any other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Wood was then cross-examined by the appellant’s lawyer for almost two hours, where his evidence was pored over in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, we were lucky enough to hear from Dr Diane Coffey of Save Woodley’s Greenbelt. Dr Coffey reinforced the damage that this proposal will have on the Tame Valley, as well as the lack of ‘Very Special Circumstances’ to constitute a release of green belt land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then heard from Councillor Jack Naylor, who represents the Denton South Ward. Cllr Naylor spoke very passionately about the impact that this proposal would have on Denton, as well as his feelings of frustration at the lack of acknowledgement of Denton’s concerns. The inquiry then adjourned for the remainder of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Day 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the Inquiry focussed on my evidence and gave me the opportunity to present my ‘evidence in chief’. I won’t pretend that this wasn’t an incredibly nerve-racking day. I spoke for almost an hour and set out and expanded upon my key objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I argued that the development would destroy the openness of the Valley and reinforced the historical importance of the area to the surrounding communities. I also expressed my concern that the low Ashton Rail Bridge would cause high-sided HGVs to go through Denton to avoid bridge strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_234873" style="width: 413px;" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234873" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-234873" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28-1024x872.jpeg" alt="" width="403" height="343" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28-1024x872.jpeg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28-300x255.jpeg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28-768x654.jpeg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28-1536x1308.jpeg 1536w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28-1080x919.jpeg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-10-29-at-13.25.28.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caption-attachment-234873" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pictured above: me and Russell Scott Primary School students on protesting the proposed development back in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was then subjected to a grilling on my evidence from the appellant’s lawyer. I was challenged on several points and did my best to express my profound concerns about the development. I also spoke at length about my own experiences in the Tame Valley, and the lack of need to destroy such a vital area of local importance. I also made the point that there has not – in my view – been sufficient work done to find alternate sites. I specifically referenced Ashton Moss West, which is currently included in Greater Manchester’s Places for Everyone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then introduced my expert, Nick Fenwick. Mr Fenwick is the Interim Assistant Director Planning and Transportation at Tameside Council. He has been an incredible asset to me over the course of the Inquiry, and I am very grateful for him taking the time out of his busy schedule to make the case against this development. Tameside Council allowed Mr Fenwick to appear to support my key arguments, especially relating to green belt policy. Mr Fenwick outlined the damage that the proposed site would do to the visual amenity in the valley, as well as the risk of noise and light pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Fenwick was then cross-examined by the appellant’s lawyer, before we broke for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we were joined by Councillor George Newton and Councillor Claire Reid. They spoke for a significant period of time about the proposed site, and the impact it will have on Denton. Cllr Reid highlighted a failure on the part of the appellant to recognise the unique topography of the landscape, and the benefits of open green space for the residents of Denton South. We then adjourned for the remainder of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Day 3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_234880" style="width: 392px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-234880" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1-1024x900.jpeg" alt="" width="382" height="335" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1-1024x900.jpeg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1-300x264.jpeg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1-768x675.jpeg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1-1536x1350.jpeg 1536w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1-1080x949.jpeg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-04-at-15.45.04-1.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caption-attachment-234880" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Above: Councillor Claire Reid spoke to the Inquiry at great length, and made an impassioned appeal for the proposal to be refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day three we benefitted from the perspective of a number of interests parties including Steve Marsland – Head Teacher of Russell Scott Primary School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve gave a powerful testimony to the Inquiry. He spoke about the impact that pollution has on the health of children across Tameside, and the effect that the proposal will have on an already industrialised area. He then showed a video to the inquiry, which was put together with the help of students at Russell Scott Primary School. It was great to see young people getting involved and standing up for what they believed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved on to the &amp;#8216;Case for The Appellants’, beginning with Colin Robinson, who gave evidence in favour of the developer&amp;#8217;s case. Mr Robinson argued that there was a need for employment land. His methodology was questioned robustly by the John Barrett, the lawyer representing Stockport Council. Mr Barrett argued that Mr Robinson had not adequately demonstrated that employment need could not be meet elsewhere, or at other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing from Mr Robinson, we adjourned for the remainder of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Day 4&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we started the day by hearing from Andrew Pexton, who spoke in favour of the developer and demand for employment land. Mr Pexton was queried on his methodology by Stockport, as well as on his assumption that other sites could not meet the demand for employment land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cross-examined Mr Pexton, and asked him why an alternative site (Ashton Moss West) was not being considered. I pointed out to him that Ashton Moss has better transport links, is already earmarked for employment land, and is not constrained in the same way that the Tame Valley is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved on to Transport. Now, Transport is a part of the proposal that Stockport are not seeking to query, so it fell to me to press the developer on a number of key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked their Transport expert (Christopher Hargreaves) a number of questions about the Ashton Road Bridge. I also evidenced my concerns with several emails that I have received as a Member of Pariliament which highlight the fact that a number of HGVs are detouring through Denton to avoid going underneath the bridge. This cross-examination lasted for over 40 minutes, and it was a brilliant opportunity for me to express my profound concerns both to the Inspector, and the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Next week &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, we will be hearing the appellant’s case  on Planning, Landscape, Visual and Green Belt matters. I will again be given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses where I see fit and will also be keeping local residents updated on the progress of the inquiry. The Inspector is due to visit the Tame Valley next Friday, and then we will close (all going to plan) on Tuesday the 15th of February and await a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a process that I would do again in a hurry. It is quite intimidating being faced with lawyers and interested parties and is extremely technical and time consuming. However, I am so grateful to have been given the opportunity to represent the concerns of the people I represent, and to hold the appellant to account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to do everything I can to try and get this appeal refused. I grew up wondering the Tame Valley and exploring its incredible landscape. I now delight in doing the same with my own family. Our green spaces are precious and deserve to be protected at all costs. The Tame Valley is ours. It is not for sale. I will continue to make that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weekly Round-Up</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week was a sad week for Labour – we said goodbye to our friend and colleague, Jack Dromey. Jack was a titan of the Labour movement, an excellent representative for Birmingham Erdington and a dedicated campaigner. He is a real loss to Labour, to the House, and to the people he represented for so many years. It was an honour to speak in the tributes to Jack in Parliament on Wednesday about our shared British and Irish heritage and what this meant to him. My thoughts and sympathies are with the family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to speak at the National Pensioners Convention on the pressure that the crisis in care is placing on older people due to the lack of government investment. We have a welfare state for the 2020s that is built on the life expectancy of people in the 1940s. There is an assumption embedded into the system that families will cope. No one wants to think about their own mortality or what would happen if they developed a serious illness or disability, but we must think about the system that we need in place in the twenty-first century. We in Labour do not believe that the Tory plans go far enough. Our goal should be to ensure that the UK is the best country in which to grow old because there is a system of care that no one has to wait for. We need strategies to increase recruitment, and in order to do so successfully we need to ensure fair wages and fair conditions for those who take on this vital but challenging work. Too many people are being forced to take part-time work or withdraw entirely from the workforce to help meet the care needs of relatives. Financially and practically this does not make sense. We need a system that helps people remain at home so that hospitals can continue with their vital medical care, we need a system that is financially accessible to all, and we need a system that is well-staffed. The Tories are failing in this abysmally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also met  with Care England this week as part of my role as  Shadow Minister for Health and Social Care to discuss the impact of Covid and how we should move forward. Covid has highlighted inequalities across our society but also represents a moment we can use to reset our ideas and develop policies and systems to ensure that everyone in society is cared for. We know the challenges that exist with the recruitment of staff and their retention under current pay and conditions, but it was also really interesting to talk about innovations in care. Care England is keen to develop care systems that not only look after the medical needs of those under their care, but also the mental stimulation that helps create a better future for everyone. We so often forget when we are discussing the needs of the care sector and those who will require their services that long-term care is not only about addressing medical needs, but also about ensuring that life is happy and fun – whether it’s someone to talk to, activities with others, or entertainment, we all need our minds stimulated as much as our physical needs met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was very pleased to attend a reception at the Irish Embassy for the unveiling of a bust of the late John Hume by artist Liz O’Kane. John Hume was a wonderful politician and a determined campaigner for peace in Northern Ireland and it was a wonderful occasion to once again pay tribute to a great man. Liz O’Kane is a fantastic artist and it’s a really beautiful sculpture that will remind us all of the dedication and determination that is needed to find peace in our politics and in our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Trailer and Towing Safety this week where we heard from Baroness Vere of Norbiton about proposed changes to driving licence and trailer training accreditation. We also discussed a number of reports: the Trailer Training Accreditation Scheme from the DVSA with input from APPG stakeholders; the Trailer Safety Report from the Department for Transport; the Work Programme of the APPG; and on safety awareness initiatives such as Motorway Service Areas Stops. Our roads are busier than ever; it is vital that safety is a priority. Ensuring strict regulation of trailers and their towing is a small bureaucratic price to pay to ensure that no one else is killed on our roads from a dangerous trailer. We in the APPG will continue pushing the Government for regulation that mitigates the risks on our roads and ensures that drivers are accountable for the security of their vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of living crisis has hit hard this week. With energy bills soaring the Government needed to take action to save family finances. Yet when the crunch came they could only offer a buy now, pay later solution. The loan, yes you read that right, they are giving people will be spread out over five years. This doesn’t solve the high energy prices, it simply kicks the can down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked the Chancellor if he had thought about the millions of people who use prepayment meters as they can’t receive money off their energy bills as they top up at the meter at the corner shop. He admitted the Treasury doesn’t know how to reach 60% of them at present. Once again the Chancellor has shown himself to be detached from people’s lives and unable to implement policy that will make a difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Labour Party has a fully-costed scheme that will place a levy on the oil and gas giants making billions to cut your bills. This will make a difference today and not load up people’s credit cards with more debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/02/04/weekly-round-up-16/">Weekly Round-Up</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>Covid Vaccine Newsletter from Swansea Bay University Health Board</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/covid-vaccine-newsletter-from-swansea-bay-university-health-board/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Covid Vaccine Newsletter from Swansea Bay University Health Board</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Date: February 4, 2022</u></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Edition number: 34 </u></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Introduction:</u></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We have given more than 800,000 doses and continue to vaccinate seven days a week.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Full details of where you can get the dose you need are below, along with information on other developments.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Latest news</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Statement from our Executive Director of Public Health, Keith Reid, following an issue at the Bay Mass Vaccination Centre last weekend.</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“I wish to apologise to those young people who were turned away from the vaccination centre at the weekend after responding to an invitation for a second dose.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“This shouldn’t have happened and I am sorry for the upset and upheaval this will have caused you and your families. I also recognise that you now have to attend again to get the vaccination and I hope that your experience on your recent visit has not put you off getting a second dose of vaccine.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“I have asked for an investigation to establish why this occurred so we can prevent it happening again.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“We understand that at least 30 young people were turned away in error over the Saturday and Sunday and we are really sorry about this. The investigation will look in detail at why this happened and the exact numbers who were affected. But at this stage it does not appear that the invitations were issued too early.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Vaccination for those with allergies</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">If you have an allergy or allergies, we understand you will need good quality information on how your body might react to vaccination before deciding to go ahead.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">If you do have questions or concerns you can speak to one of our clinicians by contacting our booking line on <span dir="ltr">01792 200492</span> or <span dir="ltr">01639 862323</span> before attending for vaccination.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">After speaking to you, the clinical lead may refer you to the allergy clinic where there is the potential option of having the vaccine in a specialised clinic if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We have also pulled together some vaccination facts that may help:</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">·         The Covid vaccines are safe for those with allergies (including anaphylaxis) to wasp, bee or other insect stings and allergies to any food or drink.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         The current vaccines do not contain any traces of nuts, gluten, egg, or soy.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         The current vaccines do not contain latex and are therefore suitable for those with an allergy to latex.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         All UK approved Covid vaccines do not contain penicillin or any other antibiotics. If you are allergic to penicillin or another antibiotic, you can still receive the vaccines.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         All immunisers are trained and will assess suitability for vaccination when they go through the eligibility questions prior to vaccination. If there is any concern they will refer to our allergy service for advice.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">·         If vaccination goes ahead the immuniser might request you wait for longer post vaccination – up to 30 minutes.<b> </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Getting the vaccine</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">You can get whatever dose you need at drop-in sessions or by booking online.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">In addition, we continue to invite those who become eligible.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Drop-in sessions are available at the Bay MVC, our containers (local vaccination centres) at the Guildhall in Swansea, Pontardawe Leisure Centre and in a number of community pharmacies.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span dir="ltr">From Wednesday, February 16</span><sup><span dir="ltr">th</span></sup>, we will also have a container outside Croeserw Community Hub.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/PqoOCL73oFzAxl3CBXxla?domain=sbuhb.nhs.wales/">Please go to our website for more details on vaccination sessions and the online booking link.</a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Important information:</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraph">·         Anyone 18 or over or under 18 and in an at-risk category who has had a positive Covid test result must wait until 28 days have passed following the positive result before having a vaccination.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">·         Anyone aged 12 to 17 who is not at risk and has had a positive Covid test result must wait until 12 weeks have passed following the positive result before having a vaccination.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         Please note, the vaccination appointment system generates appointments based on the date of the previous dose and is not able to take a positive Covid test result into account. So you may get an invitation to attend before the 28 day or 12-week waiting period is up. Please only attend once the appropriate period has passed post the positive test result.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         There does not need to be any gap between a HPV vaccine and Covid vaccine, no matter which comes first.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">·         There must be a gap of 13 weeks or more between a 2nd or 3rd primary dose and a booster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Trial for Covid treatment</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Have you just tested positive for Covid-19? Would you like to join a new UK-wide trial for effective early treatments?</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This trial is available for people who are at wider risk of serious illness from Covid-19 either because:</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">•        They are over the age of 50, or</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">•        They are aged 18 to 49 with underlying health conditions. (Many will already qualify for free annual flu jabs.)</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To take part people need to fall into one of the at-risk groups, have tested positive for Covid-19 by either a PCR or LFT test, and have symptoms.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The PANORAMIC trial involves a course of oral tablets. These tablets are already used to treat some people who are ill enough with Covid-19 to be in hospital.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The trial is now looking at how effective the treatment is for people who are still at home who test positive for Covid-19, and who have symptoms.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It is a UK-wide study and anyone who is in the at-risk categories can apply to take part, whether they have been vaccinated or not.  More details, including a link to apply online, are available on the PANORAMIC website <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Yyf4CNL3qigAKw6fj9Wln?domain=panoramictrial.org">www.panoramictrial.org</a>  Or, ring <span dir="ltr">08081 560017</span> (calls are free.)</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Once accepted onto the trial, the tablets are posted to you straight away as they should be taken within five days. You will be asked to answer follow up questions online or by telephone, but no face-to-face visits are needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Afghan interpreter’s move to Swansea translates into new NHS career</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Having flown out of Afghanistan, fearing for his life as the Taliban stormed Kabul, Mohamed Ferooz Noori is now helping save lives by working with Swansea Bay’s vaccination programme.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The father of two was relocated to the UK following the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last August.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">He had been working as a translator alongside the British military, and when he arrived in the UK was originally sent to Cardiff before moving to Swansea. He now works as a call handler in Bay Mass Vaccination Centre.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Vaccination team reflects on happy relationship with wedding venue</b><b> </b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Swansea Bay’s vaccination team has undergone an amicable parting of the ways with The Orangery at Margam.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">After delivering more than 150,000 Covid vaccinations, over the course of the past year, at the picturesque wedding venue in the grounds of Margam Park, the team is set to move to a new venue in Aberafan Shopping Centre.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The change of venue will allow The Orangery to revert to its former use as a sought-after location for happy couples to celebrate tying the knot.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">People suffering with long Covid symptoms are benefiting from getting out in the great outdoors as part of their ongoing recovery.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">A new walking group sees those taking part exercising at their own pace as they are accompanied along the route by a GP and a physiotherapy assistant practitioner.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Patients who have been referred to the Long Covid Rehabilitation Service, which runs from the Bay Field Hospital, are invited to take part in the weekly walks as an extension of the support available to them.</p>

<p>My partner and I had the chance to go to two of our favourite places recently.</p>



<p>We went to watch Kenneth Branagh&#8217;s Belfast at the Electric Cinema, the oldest working cinema in the country, and also managed to catch the new production of Animal Farm at the Rep. Both are well worth seeing.</p>



<p>The venues were busy, a sign people are desperate to get back to some sort of normality.</p>



<p>Our entertainment and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly during the pandemic. Many places have closed and won&#8217;t re-open and jobs have been lost because of continuing uncertainty. The sector is a huge part of Birmingham&#8217;s economy.</p>



<p>It needs government support, especially at a time when the cost-of living crisis is forcing people to cut back.</p>



<p>Last week, I also visited Villa Park (I also know about the great work Blues do) to hear about the work of the Aston Villa Foundation, which supports several community initiatives including help with careers in catering, entertainment and hospitality.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s real demand for skilled labour in these sectors, but people can be put off taking such jobs because of worries about long-term security of the businesses. It poses a threat to some of Birmingham&#8217;s greatest institutions.</p>



<p>The answer isn&#8217;t DWP Secretary, Therese Coffey&#8217;s, latest plan for tougher benefit sanctions. That won&#8217;t help recruitment, or skills development but it will dragoon people into areas for which they are totally unsuited while simultaneously depriving these sectors of some very talented employees.</p>



<p>The Chancellor offered limited relief with a temporary VAT cut but then put it up to 12.5% in October and intends a further increase to 20% in April, accompanied by an increase in Employer&#8217;s National Insurance.</p>



<p>Our culture, entertainment and hospitality sectors are crucial to Birmingham.</p>



<p>They need practical support to help them flourish.</p>



<p>For people who are so fond of partying, you&#8217;d think government ministers would have a bit more empathy with the hospitality sector. The people of Birmingham are doing their bit to support the Electric and the Rep and our other wonderful venues, but it would be nice if this government did their bit?</p>

    <title>Isles MP reacts to UK Government Levelling Up Strategy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/02/02/isles-mp-reacts-to-uk-government-levelling-up-strategy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Angus MacNeil MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar has reacted with caution and scepticism to the announcement of the UK Government’s long-promised plans for a Levelling Up Strategy which they state will bridge the gap on services in different parts of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil says if there is any new funding in the Levelling Up strategy announced by Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove today, it is to be welcomed, however he expressed strong doubts that funding would match EU funding sources lost through Brexit and Scotland would likely be left out of pocket on that count alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Scottish Government and opposition parties at Westminster have expressed disappointment that the plans do not include any new money or fresh thinking and sadly it looks like a distraction announcement from the disasters of Boris Johnson at present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many are suggesting that the launch of the strategy is an attempt by the Prime Minister to detract attention from the weeks of pressure regarding parties at Downing Street during lockdown restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angus MacNeil said: “If the UK Government are serious, then there should be a lot more money behind this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need to engage on this and we have to make sure that the UK Government is not just putting out a glib press release to say they are doing something or play silly political games with the Scottish Government at the expense of the hopes in the North and West of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the UK Government are serious about these plans, it needs to be serious with money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The North and West of Scotland were living in an ‘economic freezer’ as a result of decades of Bank of England financial policies which are made for the Southeast of England, making Scotland out to be geographically peripheral, which we are not as Ireland, Norway and Demark prove.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed out that issues relating to connectivity of the islands and the potential to explore Sub Sea tunnel options, as in other parts of Europe, could be an option if there was a will and financial support to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>City Council Leader Responds to “Levelling Up” Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/02/02/city-council-leader-responds-to-levelling-up-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith criticises No. 10 drinking culture</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;My comments on the Prime Minister&amp;#8217;s response to the partial Sue Gray report:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Prime Minister needs to go. This isn’t about wine, cheese or cake. It’s about trust and leadership. Under this Prime Minister, we have had a government focussed on covering up events over the pandemic. But the reality is there has been a culture of drinking and partying in Number 10 and it shows a complete lack of care for the hardships that have been faced by the public through this time of national crisis. If the Prime Minister can’t be trusted to tell the truth about this, he cannot be trusted to run the country. He’s a lame duck Prime Minister, and if his MPs continue to prop him up it’s the country that will suffer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further local update.</p>
<p>A few people have asked me why I do not use these bulletins to address national issues, and clearly there are some controversial ones at the moment. But I have always kept these updates as ways of informing you about local issues or ones that directly affect our area and will carry on doing so. If you want to raise national issues or political matters with me, you are always free to email separately.</p>
<p>Some of you are also receiving one of these updates for the first time because you have contacted me for the first time recently. I hope you will find them helpful. But please unsubscribe using the link at the bottom if you do not want to receive them.</p>
<p>Firstly a couple of matters related to the pandemic.</p>
<h2>International Travel</h2>
<p>Many of you have been concerned that children aged between 12 and 15 will not have access to vaccine passports for overseas travel at half term, or because the system cannot show that they have recently had the virus. This should now be sorted next week, with the vaccine passports being updated to allow travel. However you should also check the rules for the country you are going to as some, including Spain in particular, have tight rules which may still make travel difficult. All of the details about individual countries are on the Foreign Office travel advice pages at: <strong><a href="http://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Care Home Visits</h2>
<p>A number of you have also raised the issue of care home visits. This has been a particularly difficult matter for many families. The guidance for care homes is now being changed and the restrictions on the number of visitors allowed are being removed from Monday. You will be able to find full details of the new rules on the gov.uk website from then.</p>
<h2>South Western Rail Services</h2>
<p>Those of you who use the railways will be aware of the continuing frustration about the reduced level of service because of the pandemic and because of the number of staff off work with the virus. While South Western Railway is now back to offering four trains to Waterloo between 0700 and 0800, it is still only running a train every 30 minute after that. I am pushing hard for this to be changed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As passenger numbers build back up again, I am also renewing pressure on both Ministers and SWR to increase the number of peak time trains beyond their current plans. I am hopeful that we will get at least some further trains added to the timetable during the year.</p>
<p>Please do keep me in touch about any particularly overcrowded services as I am generally travelling before or after the peak at the moment.</p>
<h2>Southern Rail Services – Tattenham Corner</h2>
<p>For Southern users from Tattenham Corner, the company has told me that they will reintroduce the faster direct services to London Bridge as well as additional Victoria services after the 19th February.</p>
<h2>Parking on Epsom Downs</h2>
<p>If you are a regular user of the Downs, the Downs Conservators and the Jockey Club have asked Surrey to close the road that leads to the upper car park overnight and during the mornings. There is a public consultation on this which closes next week. If you want to express a view the link is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.surreysays.co.uk/environment-and-infrastructure/old-london-road-epsom-prohibition-of-vehicles-prop/">www.surreysays.co.uk/environment-and-infrastructure/old-london-road-epsom-prohibition-of-vehicles-prop/</a></strong></p>
<p>I hope you are keeping well.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>It was an honour to sign the Holocaust Education Trust UK Book of Commitment earlier this week ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day today. </p>



<p>It is important that we all take time to remember the millions of Jews and others who died in the Holocaust and pay tribute to the survivors. </p>



<p>We must also redouble our efforts to stand up to all forms of racism and prejudice. </p>

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisleslie.org/link-situs-judi-bola-terpercaya-alternatif-solusi-paling-tepat-bermain/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chrisleslie.org/link-situs-judi-bola-terpercaya-alternatif-solusi-paling-tepat-bermain/"&gt;Link Situs Judi Bola Terpercaya Alternatif, Solusi Paling Tepat Bermain&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Susah bermain akan membuat penghasilan macet dan berimbas pada kehidupan. Tapi hal tersebut bisa diatas dengan link situs judi bola terpercaya. Permainan taruhan sepakbola sudah menjadi kegiatan sehari hari bagi banyak orang. Tua muda atau pun dewasa memainkan permainan yang satu ini. Tak heran sebenarnya karena bola adalah permainan berbagai kalangan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudah ada kecintaan terhadap permainan bola membuat permainan versi judi akan disukai. Hanya dengan menebak permainan sepele saja sudah akan bisa menghasilkan untung siapa yang tahan? Oleh karena itu tak heran minat memainkan taruhan sepakbola semakin membludak akhir akhir ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapi, ada dilema yang membuat permainantaruhan sepakbola banyak penggemar terjadi. Dilema tersebut adalah susah bermain. Banyak pemain akan membuat server sering mengalami trouble yang berakibat pada susah bermain. Sudah sering terjadi seperti pada pendaftaran cpns yang selalu membuat server breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oleh sebab itu, untuk mengatasi permasalahan yang akan terjadi. Pastikan diri Anda menggunakan link situs judi bola terpercaya. Dengan link tersebut semuanya akan bisa teratasi, tetapi juga akan ada cara lainnya yang mungkin akan berfungsi untuk Anda. Tergantung dari permasalahan yang anda alami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Link Situs Judi Bola Terpercaya Alternatif Resmi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Untuk permasalahan link yang mengalami breakdown, Anda bisa menggunakan link alternatif. Setiap agen penyedia permainan pasti menyediakan link situs taruhan sepakbola terpercaya alternatif. Dengan link tersebut, Anda akan mendapatkan bantuan untuk tetap bermain meskipun server sudah tidak bisa dibuka karena kepenuhan user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link alternatif ini adalah lalu lintas alternatif bila lalu lintas pokok mengalami masalah. Jadi, lalu lintas browsing Anda dialihkan kepada cara lain. Meskipun menggunakan cara lain Anda akan tetap bisa digunakan dengan mudah tanpa harus melakukan hal khusus. Untuk menggunakannya, Anda hanya perlu mengakses seperti biasanya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lantas dimana tempat mendapatkan link alternatif? Tepatnya anda bisa mendapatkan link alternatif pada bagian laman pengenal. Atau mungkin lebih amannya Anda bertanya kepada costumer service. Mereka pasti akan memberikan link alternatif agar anggota anggotanya tetap bisa bermain meskipun situs utama breakdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bila Anda belum sempat mendapatkan link alternatif. Bergabunglah kepada forum diskusi karena biasanya mereka akan mendiskusikan link alternatif juga. Dengan begini Anda akan mendapatkan informasi yang bagus mengenai link terpercaya. Link terpercaya seperti ini pastinya akan berguna untuk Anda dapatkan permainan yang akurat serta aman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vpn, Proxy, Kpn Tunnel untuk Situs Terblokir&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sedangkan untuk permasalahan link live casino taruhan sepakbola terpercaya yang mengalami blokir. Anda bisa menggunakan vpn, proxy, kpn tunnel dan penyamar alamat ip. Dengan alamat ip yang disamarkan pasti akan tetap membuka situs yang mengalami blokir. Alat alat seperti ini banyak jenisnya namun yang direkomendasikan adalah vpn, proxy dan kpn tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengan ketiga alat tersebut, Anda akan bisa membuka situs yang terblokir tanpa susah. Untuk vpn cara kerjanya dengan aplikasi kebanyakan, sedangkan untuk proxy dan kpn tunnel kebanyakan cara kerjanya dengan browser. Tetapi tetap ada cara lainnya yang bisa Anda pergunakan sesuai dengan selera pribadi diri.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cara kerja yang digunakan oleh alat alat ini sebenarnya tidak jaug berbeda dengan link w2ebsite taruhan sepakbola terpercaya. Tetapi disini alamat yang anda gunakan tetap sama dengan alamat utamanya. Tidak ada alamat yang berbeda karena yang akan disamarkan adalah ip Anda. Sebenarnya cara seperti ini akan lebih aman dibandingkan sebelumnya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semua masalah susah bermain pasti akan bisa teratasi bila Anda tahu permasalahannya. Sekarang zaman sudah canggih dan semuanya bisa Anda atasi tanpa perlu bantuan teknisi.

    <title>Global Vaccine Access, 13 January 2022</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2022/01/13/global-vaccine-access-13-january-2022/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I spoke in a Westminster Hall debate on the need for the UK Government to urgently do more to enable global access to vaccines for COVID-19. A global response is essential. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="Global Vaccine Access WH 13 January 2022" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RccjPkEd0QY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full text of my speech:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I want to declare an interest I&amp;#8217;m chair of the all party group on vaccinations for all. And vice-chair of the Coronavirus all party group, where we&amp;#8217;ve been taking evidence every fortnight since July, 2020, including hearing from health ministers across Sub-Saharan Africa and other places that emphasize what we&amp;#8217;ve been hearing today, the difficulties they have in access, and also the poor quality of supply that they&amp;#8217;re actually getting. It is certainly true that all of us have gained from the researchers who&amp;#8217;ve developed new vaccines and I too pay tribute to the staff of the four NHS across the UK, for the speed and skill with which they have delivered it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we have vaccinated almost 80% of adults with a third or booster shot, when the access to even one shot in low-income countries is well below 10%. And that simply highlights what we mean by, in adequate access and inequity across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High-income countries have literally hoovered up the vaccines as they were developed over the last year. And that&amp;#8217;s indefensible. It&amp;#8217;s very reminiscent of aids. When people in Africa who were suffering from HIV or aids couldn&amp;#8217;t access the treatments that were available in the richer countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spring before 2020, I keep forgetting it&amp;#8217;s a new year. We heard lots of warm words about a global response, to a global crisis. But that is simply not what we&amp;#8217;ve seen. We have seen that COVAX was established and the UK government gave over 500 million pounds to it. It didn&amp;#8217;t give any vaccines until quite late last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And what was meant to happen with COVAX is that they would procure directly from companies &amp;#8211; that never happened. And therefore COVAX has ended up completely dependent on getting donated doses from countries that were wealthy and simply did advanced procurements. And that&amp;#8217;s the reason COVAX has delivered less than half of the 2 billion doses it was aspiring to deliver last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK government promised a hundred million doses in June 2021 at the G7 -80 million to COVAX, 20 million bilaterally. There&amp;#8217;s been less than a quarter of that, that has actually been delivered to COVAX. We are at the end of 2021, the hundred million is meant to be delivered by this coming June, which means 9.1 million a month to COVAX, a total of 11 and a half million if you include any bilateral donations. So the UK needs to radically step up donations of doses. And donations of doses are the acute response. Because that can be done in the short term. The UK has enough excess that it could carry out its third and indeed for many vulnerable patients, fourth doses, as I&amp;#8217;ve had myself as an immunocompromised person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And still accelerate the donation of doses to more than meet its target by June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marker&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is wealthy countries think they can protect their populations purely by vaccinating their own population. And Omicron shows that simply isn&amp;#8217;t true. When you have large parts of the world, particularly in the global south with low access to vaccines, you will generate high spread. You will generate therefore more mutations, and eventually there will be new variants. And some of those variants may be as infectious as Omicron, may be as transmissible, may be as good at at escaping either natural immunity or previous vaccination. They may turn out to be much more severe. This fairy story that inevitably a virus is committed to becoming milder is something that we are not in a position to count on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we still right now, two years into this crisis need a global response. And I therefore would call on the government the need to accelerate the donations, using the excess that we have. But these do need to be predictable. They need to be in collaboration with the low-income countries that are receiving them and they need to have a decent shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We heard of ministers having to visit the ports every day in case something had arrived. Having to keep stopping their own programs because suddenly they get a delivery that&amp;#8217;s got a few weeks left on it. So that is disrespectful to countries that do not have the health infrastructure that we have across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is critical to include consumables like syringes, needles. It&amp;#8217;s also important to try and support the wider COVID-19 responses. If you look at the WHO data, you will notice the incredibly low levels of COVID supposedly in Africa. Africa does not have low levels. They have low levels of access to tests, and therefore the cases are not being registered. And we shouldn&amp;#8217;t be using these doses as part of the already reduced ODA budget and certainly not charging them as more than the UK government has paid for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the short term approach, but the medium term approach is to massively increase global production. And the problem is the TRIPSwaiver has been being discussed basically for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;d be in a totally different position if that had been moved on at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK is one of a dwindling number of countries, which is blocking it -over 130 countries now support it. And it is important to recognize that most of the leading COVID-19 vaccines have indeed been developed with public funding, either from university settings, which are largely publicly funded or through the huge injections by the UK government, the US government, the EU governments and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is important when we touched on polio, to think about the fact that Salt didn&amp;#8217;t patent his vaccine, Alexander Fleming didn&amp;#8217;t patent penicillin, Röntgen didn&amp;#8217;t patent x-rays because they saw them as part of the global good.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as getting rid of the blockage of intellectual property rights and patents,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s important that there is proper sharing of data and technology transfer. But MSF have identified a hundred companies across Africa, Asia and Latin America, which are certified by the EMA, by the FDA or the WHO on good manufacturing practice. So to imply that it isn&amp;#8217;t possible to produce vaccines to high quality in the global south is frankly insulting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And messenger RNA vaccines hold a whole hope in the future for many neglected, tropical diseases, such as TB, such as malaria and others because of the technology. So by sharing that technology, now, it isn&amp;#8217;t just about dealing with COVID-19. It actually opens up the ability to tackle the scourges of infectious diseases that many countries face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that the UK should be increasing production, to become a net exporter instead of importer. And therefore it is absolutely inexplicable why the UK government pooled funding from the Valneva production site in Livingston, when the trial data was about to be published. That was successful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And as has been mentioned, because it&amp;#8217;s a very traditional whole virus approach. There may be people who have been unwilling to take the messenger RNA vaccines, who would be willing to receive the Valneva vaccine. Because it&amp;#8217;s whole virus, it may, and this has not yet been trialed, also provide a broader reaction&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;that may therefore remain viable, even when other variants arrive. What we&amp;#8217;ve seen is that Omicron in comparison to Delta, which had four mutations on the spike protein Omicron has 32, it&amp;#8217;s a totally different shape. And therefore, sadly, the AstraZeneca vaccine simply the key no longer fits the lock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pfizer does. But it wanes. We need to have broader vaccines so that we might be a bit more resistant to, to variance in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also important for the government to maintain the support for routine vaccination. And that means honoring the replenishment commitments to Gavi because routine vaccinations have suffered due to the disruption of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s important that UK has always been a leading funder of vaccination and they mustn&amp;#8217;t now pool back. But also to think about future pandemics, the replenishment of Sepi, the epidemic preparedness initiative is coming up this year. The UK needs to commit to that. We are all talking about humanitarian and the moral need to support people in poor countries to have the access we&amp;#8217;ve had..&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But on top of the lives lost and the huge multi-trillion economic hit to the world, it is important that we recognize that this was a global challenge. The international community so far has failed. It doesn&amp;#8217;t hold great hope for that other challenge of climate crisis if we can&amp;#8217;t get our act together now in facing this.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invitation to Zoom residents&#8217; meeting&nbsp;&#8211; 7.30pm, Friday 27th November&nbsp;2020:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>). The latest business grants for businesses affected by the recent restrictions are now available through the local Council, which you can find <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/">here</a>.

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

    <title>Grant Shapps welcomes hospital improvements as he meets new NHS Trust CEO</title>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>MP for Welwyn Hatfield Grant Shapps recently met with Adam Sewell-Jones, the new CEO of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust to discuss health services in the area.</strong></p>
<p>During the meeting, Mr Shapps was updated on the current status of the Trust with regard to dealing with the current omicron variant of covid, as well as new investments being made in the local Trust to improve the quality of its services.</p>
<p>Key amongst the announced investments Grant and Adam discussed was a new Community Diagnostic Centre will be built in Welwyn Hatfield, one of 40 across the country – providing a one-stop-shop for key testing to boost early diagnoses and speed up and increase referrals.</p>
<p>The Centres will provide a full range of scans and tests to patients to catch illnesses at the earliest signs – increasing NHS capacity and saving lives as the NHS aims to work through the historic elective backlog caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Local MP Grant Shapps has welcomed the announcement that the QEII centre in Welwyn Garden City has been selected as one of 40 sites across England for a new Community Diagnostic Centre to be built, with an initial investment of £2.85 million awarded by the Department for Health &amp; Social Care.</p>
<p>The centre will provide services closer to home for people in Welwyn Hatfield to meet rising demand, as part of the Conservative Government’s plan to tackle the NHS backlog and catch health issues quickly.</p>
<p>The QEII’s new Community Diagnostic Centre will achieve earlier diagnoses for patients through easier, faster, and more direct access to the full range of scans and tests needed to understand patients’ symptoms – including breathlessness and cancer symptoms.</p>
<p>The centre will also help reduce the risk of Covid transmission and contribute to the NHS’ net zero efforts by reducing the number of patients journeys required in Welwyn Hatfield through providing multiple scans and tests in a single visit.</p>
<p>Also on the cards for the local health service is a £2.4 million investment to create three new procedure rooms, split between the QEII and Lister hospitals.</p>
<p>The rooms will provide extra capacity for minor procedures, freeing up valuable space in operation theatres- improving theatre productivity and supporting efforts to reduce waiting list.</p>
<p>Adam Sewell-Jones said: “It was great to meet Mr Shapps and to share our plans for services in the area, including investing in the New QEII Hospital and working hard to reduce waiting times.</p>
<p>“Work begins shortly on a new procedure room at the New QEII, which will allow for minor procedures to take place locally. This means we can more effectively use our main theatre space at Lister Hospital to treat people who are waiting for more serious operations.</p>
<p>“We are also ensuring better access to diagnostics at the New QEII, such as MRI, CT, X-rays and ultrasound – seven days a week, and with extended opening hours. This will help us to diagnose conditions more quickly.</p>
<p>“The urgent treatment centre at the New QEII is now closed overnight because there were very low numbers of people needing care in those hours. It remains open and well-used during the day and I urge people to continue to seek treatment there for minor injuries and illnesses.</p>
<p>“I’d like to thank the public for their support for our hardworking staff and the Trust while we continue to work through the effects of the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “We know that many people have not been coming forward for key tests throughout the pandemic, which has contributed to the backlog, and can result in worsening health outcomes.</p>
<p>“The new Community Diagnostic Centre will help deliver better services for people across Welwyn Hatfield. By allowing problems to be detected earlier, better treatment can be given to patients.</p>
<p>“Through investing in early diagnosis and increasing NHS capacity we will be able to treat serious illnesses sooner and save lives – levelling up health outcomes across the country. Alongside these new procedure rooms, things are looking positive for our local health services.”</p></div>

<p>I have had the opportunity to celebrate some of these heroes in Parliament – and where it has been safe to do so, meet with them, and thank them, in person.  But there are many more, the unsung majority – you will know a few of them yourselves. You may even be one of them but don’t even think about it.</p>
<p>To them all, I say thank you.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, no better example of the best of our communities than the MFR Cash for Kids Christmas Appeal.</p>
<p>People across the Highlands came together to ensure every local child had a gift to open on Christmas day.</p>
<p>The incredible Cash for Kids team worked flat out to deliver all the gifts across the Highlands – and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>They were supported by local fundraisers, businesses, volunteers, and all of you, who took the time to buy a gift that is sure to have put a smile on a child’s face on Christmas day, not to mention offer some slight relief to struggling parents.</p>
<p>It is heart-warming to imagine the weight lifted off families and the smile on the face of their child – even if it was just for one day.</p>
<p>Especially when more families than ever before are facing a tough time.</p>
<p>Along with amazing local charities, foodbanks and community volunteers, my team and I are doing all we can to help as well as continuing to urge the UK Government to change course.</p>
<p>But the reality is, the UK Government know the impact of the choices they are making, these are deliberate actions.</p>
<p>With its limited powers over Social Security the Scottish Government is showing different choices can be made by putting dignity and respect at the heart of policy.</p>
<p>What better place to start building a Social Security system ensuring every child has a fair start in life?</p>
<p>As we look ahead to 2022, I hope this is a statement of intent on which we can all agree.</p>
<p>To you and your family, from me, my family, and my team, I wish you a Happy New Year.</p>

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients. You can find further information about the vaccination programme on the NHS website. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccination-programme/?fbclid=IwAR1fpUmKNp4yRr6QmFb7LJiCh5LvoLTJx6-Qah39dx87VAq6ASeUi1ZiApM" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/…/covid-19-vaccination…/</a>This is more progress on the path to recovery and a bit of good news as we keep up the fight against C-19. </p>

    <title>£50 million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire to level up education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2021/12/17/50-million-funding-boost-for-schools-in-lincolnshire-to-level-up-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Schools in Lincolnshire will receive £50million in extra funding next year, as part of a £4 billion funding boost from the Conservative Government across the country.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funding per pupil will increase nationally by five per cent in real terms from next year, giving significant increases for every pupil in every school.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A record £1 billion extra will be spent to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, so that all young people can reach their full potential.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that schools in Lincolnshire will receive £648 million in funding next year, a boost of £50million as part of the Conservative Government’s £4 billion increase in spending for schools across the country.</p>
<p>The £4 billion extra funding for school delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment when entering Downing Street, when he pledged to level up school funding by pledging over £14 billion for primary and secondary schools by 2022-23.</p>
<p>The £50million extra funding can use for hiring specialist teachers, providing training, and purchasing school supplies including textbooks.</p>
<p>The total extra funding for schools means mainstream schools will receive £41.7 billion in 2022-23, an increase of 5.8 per cent per pupil. Every primary school will receive at least £4,362 per pupil, and every secondary school at least £5,669 per pupil.</p>
<p>Matt Warman has also commended the Conservative Government’s targeted £1 billion boost to funding for special educational needs and disabilities, which is a record 13 per cent increase on this year’s funding.</p>
<p>The extra funding will help schools, councils, and other specialist providers provide the right care and support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities – so that every child receives the help they need to learn and fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>The increases in school funding follows the investment of nearly £5 billion in education recovery, which includes £1.5 billion on tutoring in schools and colleges across the country to help children and young people catch up on lost learning during the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<p>“No child or young person should be limited by where they grow up – they should be supported to get a world class education at school.</p>
<p>“The £50million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire will help them to hire more teachers, get materials to support pupils learning, and support pupils with special needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>“As we build back fairer, this funding will ensure every young person can receive the education they deserve so they can fulfil their potential.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Schools Minister Robin Walker said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Every pupil, no matter where they grow up or go to school, deserves an excellent education and the chance to fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>“This £4 billion funding boost delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment to level up school funding – giving significant increases to every pupil in every school – and taken alongside our ambitious education recovery plan with additional investment of almost £5 billion, will support every young person to catch up following the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This additional investment also represents a significant boost to high needs funding, helping local authorities support pupils with special educational needs, and helping to ensure all young people can thrive and succeed.”</p></blockquote>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

    <title>Emma Leads a Debate on Sewage Pollution in Whitburn</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-leads-a-debate-on-sewage-pollution-in-whitburn/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>



<p>You can read my full speech <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-10-27/debates/2FE67ECE-5C5C-4910-876B-9610627E645A/SewagePollutionWhitburn">here.</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
