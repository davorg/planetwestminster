            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>As you know, I have focussed my campaigning efforts in Westminster to make a real difference in improving the water quality of our rivers.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>So last month I welcomed a significant set of measures announced in a comprehensive Plan for Water, which pulled together a wide range of policy initiatives across Government to create a fresh strategy to improve water quality of our rivers and sustainability of water supply.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The new Secretary of State for DEFRA is determined to tackle the long-term challenges posed by under-investment in our drainage and supply networks underground, which have not kept pace with development above ground for 60 years.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The need to do so was graphically illustrated again at the end of March by publication of the latest sewage discharge stats for 2022. While these showed a 19% reduction in the frequency of discharges from treatment works and combined storm overflows across England and a 34% reduction in duration compared with 2021, this was primarily due to reduced rainfall during the year. So the pressure remains on water companies to get to grips with preventing these wholly unacceptable routine sewage discharges. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I believe these new measures will make a material difference and have given this Plan a broad welcome - not least since these proposals accept many of the recommendations from the Environmental Audit Committee in our seminal report last year into Water Quality of our Rivers. The Plan also reflects several campaign themes of the Conservative Environment Network contained in their Water Manifesto which I endorsed late last year.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>These include giving greater power to regulators, the Environment Agency and Ofwat, to issue unlimited fines on water companies for breaching their permits; and for those fines to be ring-fenced in new Water Restoration Funds to improve water quality. There are currently over 2,000 cases of such breaches by six water companies being investigated by regulators which could lead to fines or criminal prosecution.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Regulators will also have the power, which we had also called for, to link senior executives’ remuneration and shareholder dividends to environmental performance.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>It is not all about water companies either, farmers have a role to play, both reducing nutrient leakage and managing supply of water. So, I welcome further funding for slurry storage and encouragement for buffer zones for pollinators and tree planting along waterways, as well as the consultation on reducing planning barriers for on-farm reservoirs and creating wetlands to help integrate flood planning.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Locally I am encouraged by Severn Trent's engagement with local communities, businesses, and farmers to raise awareness about the importance of protecting and improving the ecosystem of our rivers. It's vital that we work together to ensure the sustainability of our natural resources for future generations. By partnering with local groups, Severn Trent is seeking to work with local community groups in improving the health of our rivers.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Advice and some financial support is becoming available for farmers to help them reduce their impact on waterways. Farmers have a vital role to play in managing pesticide and fertilizer use and improving soil management practices. STWs "Get River Positive" campaign aims to fix its own discharges and encourage sustainable agriculture practice in its catchment.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>STW plans to invest £1.2 billion over the next five years to improve water quality, reduce leakage, and increase resilience to climate change. Locally £4.5 million of this is being invested in the next two years in improving treatment works and Combined Sewer Overflows along 12 miles of the River Teme between Leintwardine and Tenbury Wells to get the river to high water quality standard.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We as consumers can also play our part by stopping flushing wet wipes down the loo and putting filters in washing machines to stop microfibres from our clothes being flushed out. There will be a consultation on banning plastic in wet wipes to reduce the risk of blocking sewers.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There is still much more to do to clean up our rivers and coastlines, including reducing surface water runoff from roads and developments, designating more bathing waters, and tackling nutrient pollution. But the measures set out in the Plan for Water represent a credible and wide-ranging strategy to tackle the scourges of pollution and underinvestment that have blighted England's waterways for too long.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <title>article at request of Daily Telegraph re North Sea oil and gas production</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2023/05/01/article-at-request-of-daily-telegraph-re-north-sea-oil-and-gas-production/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div class="x_elementToProof"> I find it bizarre that people oppose the UK producing more of our own oil and gas. By doing so, far from cutting world carbon dioxide output they would increase it. I read of opposition to the development of the  Rosebank field, which would make us more dependent on CO 2 rich imports.   This field has been at the heart of the controversy over new  energy investment in the UK for sometime, with green enthusiasts  claiming we should not go ahead with a good project. This makes no sense. If we fail to produce oil and gas from Rosebank we will simply import it from somewhere else. If we import liquified natural gas it will generate more than twice as much CO2 in the process of compressing it, shipping it and converting it back to gas than simply piping some more home gas down the West Shetland pipe system . These pipelines are already in place with a shortage  of gas to use them.   If we import more oil that too will require more energy to carry it  further by ship from faraway places.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">          All those who are impatient to see carbon dioxide reduced should look at it globally. The absurdities of carbon accounting mean if the UK stops producing its own fossil fuels, and closes down much of its energy intensive industries it will claim to have reduced CO 2 , yet total worldwide CO 2 will go up to cover all our imports and the transport they require. The way to decarbonise is to get more consumers to buy electric vehicles and heat pumps to cut their need for gas and oil. When that happens the oil and gas producers will adjust to the reality of the market place. All the forecasts however show a relatively slow take up of the crucial products of the electrical revolution. The global estimates point to the world  needing at least as much oil and gas in 2030 as today whatever the UK does. We should not be arguing that the UK must import everything whilst still being  indirectly very dependent on fossil fuels.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">           The net zero policies being urged on government are  damaging to UK jobs, incomes, balance of payments and growth. The Rosebank field itself offers 300 million barrels of oil and 39 million cubic feet a day of gas over the lifetime of the field. It will take an £8.1 bn investment to bring it about with four fifths of that investment spent in the UK, boosting other jobs and incomes. The production of oil and gas will be through a subsea completion tied into a refurbished floating production and storage offloading vessel. Re use of a physical asset already fashioned is a further way of keeping CO 2 down.  This has been converted to run off electricity when supplies of renewable power are available. Why should we turn down this investment designed to keep a bit more oil and gas production and the skilled well paid jobs that go with it here at home? Why would be want to farm this kind of opportunity out to a foreign land and import from them instead? Turning down such an investment also means foregoing large sums in tax revenues, made all the bigger now there are higher rates of corporation tax and windfall taxes for energy companies to pay. Keep these taxes too high for too long and we will lose the opportunity of oil and gas investment at home, which is presumably the aim of some lobbying on this topic.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">           The damage of high energy prices, bans on production and penal taxes goes wider into the energy using industries. The UK Emissions Trading Scheme is a tougher version of the EU one, giving the UK the highest  carbon taxes of any major country. This again does not cut world  carbon dioxide output, but shifts where industrial activity can take place. All the time we want to buy steel, glass, ceramics, cement, bricks, petrochemicals and other products that need a lot of energy we will end up importing when UK output  becomes too dear. Our industrial landscape is being progressively shrunk by high taxes and regulations against CO 2 output  at home. We are once again the losers from misleading accounting. Some of the most competitive countries in the world at these products have no carbon tax at all. Even closer competitors in the EU or parts of the US have lower carbon taxes than we deploy. Meanwhile the lobbying in the UK is geared to raising the price of carbon further in a drive to close down much of what remains of our high energy using industries.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">            The world does not owe us a living. There are limits to just how much we can import. If we carry on importing so much more than we export, as we did for some years over trade in goods with the continent we will weaken our currency. We also have to sell more and more of our assets to pay the bills, or run up larger borrowings in foreign currencies.  Countries that do too much of that end up in financial trouble and have to cut back their consumption to correct the imbalances. The net zero model for the UK is based around a further large increase in imports. Even the green investments themselves are heavily import dependent, with batteries, wind turbines, steel, lithium, copper and the other sinews of the electrical revolution largely coming from abroad. This is the policy that has launched a thousand  large ships to bring in the imports. A more  balanced policy will bring greater prosperity for the UK, more jobs and investment, and lower CO 2 for the world as a whole.</div>

    <title>NHS dentistry access has become almost impossible for so many</title>

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Access to NHS Dentistry is almost impossible for many constituents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new generation in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Newcastle?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; who have never had access to dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as causing pain and suffering now, the Tories are also building up additional cost for the future. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ut7i8cUxGb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ut7i8cUxGb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this excellent and incredibly important debate. In Newcastle, where NHS dentistry access has become almost impossible for so many of my constituents, a whole generation of young people and children are growing up without access to an NHS dentist. Does she agree that that is causing immense suffering now and storing up not only pain and suffering but additional costs for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>It comes as the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed to Tim this week that just 25 farms in the entire Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency have signed up to the new Sustainable Farming Incentive.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"There's never been a more uncertain time for British farming so this is a really good opportunity to put the concerns of farmers directly to ministers.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Government has proposed to offer upland farmers in the Lakes and Dales a payment which is a third less than other farms. Many of those farms are now facing the prospect of either going out of business or else having to intensify their farming in order to make ends meet - and damaging the environment in the process.</em></p>
<p><em>"As a result, our beautiful, historic Cumbrian landscapes could change dramatically for the worse in a very quick time..</em></p>
<p><em>"If you have any points that you would like me to put across in the debate then please do let me know."</em></p>

    <title>MARTIN CALLS ON UK GOV TO COMMIT TO BETTER WORKER PROTECTIONS</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://martindocherty.scot/2023/04/28/iwmd-martin-calls-on-uk-gov-to-commit-to-worker-protections/" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has vowed to fight for better safety in workplaces as West Dunbartonshire marks International Workers’ Memorial Day.</p>



<p>Speaking in parliament, SNP MP Martin challenged UK government Minister Penny Mordaunt over concerns about the number of deaths linked to asbestos exposure in the workplace.</p>



<p>According to the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE), the UK has the highest rates of workplace asbestos-related deaths per capita in the world. In West Dunbartonshire, the number of people dying from mesothelioma and asbestos-related cancers is amongst the highest in the country – linked to the area’s heavy industrial past.</p>



<p>During a Westminster debate on Asbestos in the Workplace, local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes also highlighted the work of Clydebank Asbestos Group in speaking up for families affected by asbestos.</p>



<p>A select committee of MPs has recommended a target be set to remove all asbestos from public and commercial buildings within a 40-year timeframe. However, the UK government rejected these recommendations, arguing asbestos is safe if it remains undisturbed.</p>

<p>A number of MPs and trade unions say that government inaction is putting lives at risk, citing the increasing number of deaths linked to asbestos exposure in schools and hospital buildings.</p>



<p>International Workers’ Memorial Day is an annual day of remembrance on 28<sup>th</sup> April for workers killed, disabled, injured or made unwell by their work.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“As we mark International Workers’ Memorial Day, I’m determined to continue pressing for greater protections and safety in the workplace.</p>



<p>“Across the UK, too many workers lose their lives to occupational illness or fatal injury. Asbestos alone kills 5,000 people every year – and is the biggest cause of work-related deaths in this country.</p>



<p>“There is a painful legacy of asbestos in West Dunbartonshire from our shipbuilding past. However, the British government is misguided to dismiss the risk posed by asbestos in present-day public buildings and workplaces.</p>



<p>“I’ll continue working with Clydebank Asbestos Group, trade unions, and others in parliament to defend the rights of workers and raise awareness of the dangers of asbestos.”</p>

<p>Last week, I attended the Department for Work and Pensions Committee Evidence Session regarding the Plan for Jobs and Employment Support.</p>



<p>I used this opportunity to raise the suggestion of continuing support beyond the point of obtaining employment. &nbsp;I am keen for the government to learn from initiatives such as ‘Thrive into Work’, a scheme launched in the West Midlands which helps those with health issues find a job and continues to support them once in employment.</p>



<p>Additionally, I asked about the potential merits of employment support schemes being designed on a local scale.&nbsp;Devolving responsibility to a local level could help to address regional disparities that have existed in previous national schemes such as Kickstart, which was heavily weighted towards the South.</p>

<p>I was delighted to be invited to speak at the ADASS Spring Seminar this week.</p>
<p>When I think about everything councils have faced – the repeated Government cuts to council budgets, the horrors of Covid19, the endless restructuring of the NHS and u-turns on social care reform &#8211; I sometimes wonder how they keep going.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>But then I look at my own city, and Leicester’s Director of Adult Social Services Martin Samuels and his team, and I see that it’s the passion for improving the lives of older and disabled people, the commitment to making our communities better places to live, and the leadership on social care that has helped keep the show on the road.</p>

<div>Last week, I was lucky enough to be invited to attend the March of the Living as part of the UK delegation.</div>
<div dir="ltr"/>
<div id="x_x_mail-editor-reference-message-container">
<p>Taking place in Poland, the March of the Living is an annual Holocaust memorial and education programme, which includes a march to commemorate people murdered and persecuted by the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>From Monday through to Thursday, myself and other delegates from around the world met Holocaust survivors and were shown the death camps built to carry out the murder of 6 million Jews and those who didn’t fit into the perverted ideology of the Nazis.</p>
<p>It was an utterly harrowing experience. Walking into Auschwitz, beneath the infamous sign that reads ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ (‘work makes you free’) you are hit by the sickening scale of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Auschwitz itself resembles a factory, built not for producing, but for the destruction of lives. The sense of tragedy is suffocating. You see images of the people who were so brutally murdered, the men, women and children who were robbed of their humanity, killed by a sick ideology intent on removing an entire race from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, I kept asking myself the question “how could human beings do this?”</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer. The horrors are beyond comprehension. But they serve as a reminder of what happens when politics is weaponised by hate and bigotry.</p>
<p>Among the heartbreak of the trip, there were inspiring moments of profound hope. Our delegation was led around the sites by Mala, a 95-year-old Holocaust survivor. Mala has seen the worst of humanity, yet still manages to be joyful and optimistic about what the future holds.</p>
<p>The March itself reinforced this optimism.</p>
<p>I stood with thousands of delegates, Holocaust survivors and Jewish people who had come to take part in the event.</p>
<p>I was struck by the image of Jewish people of all ages following a route that, 80 years earlier, had been the site of such horrors. It felt like an act of courage, of defiance. A profound rebuke to the sickness of Nazism and fascism. Despite the millions of lives lost, hate did not win.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that Holocaust education is so important. What the Nazis did must never, ever be allowed to happen again.</p>
<p>That means all of us, across <span class="marke58f2hyd2" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span> and across the country, have a duty to call-out hate in our daily lives, to stand up for what’s right, and to pass on these principles to future generations. ‘Never again’ must be more than words, it must also be deeds.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span><span>I was very concerned to hear reports yesterday of an FOI request made to Network Rail which suggested that the sidings beside Platform 2 of Wymondham Station had been signed out of use back in 2020 due to them requiring “a large amount of work (beyond maintenance) to get [them] back in order.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For those of us who have been working on and following the Wymondham Station Access issue closely, these reports came as a considerable shock – raising some very serious questions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Previously, Network Rail agreed to shorten the length of their sidings beside Platform 2 in order to make the necessary room for a step-free access solution. Together with Greater Anglia, they developed initial plans and drawings for delivering a step-free access solution ‘preferred option’ – with South Norfolk Council, vocally supported by myself and many others, successfully securing £600,000 to go towards the works as part of the Greater Norwich Transforming Cities Fund bid.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Unfortunately however, Network Rail subsequently had to reject that ‘preferred option’ – informing the Taskforce that they now needed to retain slightly more of the sidings than had originally been thought. This change made the ‘preferred option’ untenable and therefore alternative options are having to be explored.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Concerned by the reports that the sidings may have in fact been signed out of use (contrary to the information Network Rail had previously provided), I directly contacted the Senior Public Affairs Manager for the Anglia Route at Network Rail who has today <strong>reassured me that this is not the case.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Network Rail have <strong>confirmed</strong> that there were sidings beside Platform 1 which have been signed out of use, but that <strong>the sidings beside Platform 2 remain in use</strong>. They have reiterated that they remain committed to working with local stakeholders on the campaign working to deliver step-free access to Platform 2, recognising the importance of the campaign to so many in the local community. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>While still happy to shorten their sidings beside Platform 2, Network Rail must retain enough of the sidings so that they can be used by their engineering trains.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;  &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; A constituent of mine discovered in November that HMRC had handed over £972 to the company MortgageSmiths, who took almost half of that in commission fees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he hadn&amp;#8217;t commissioned this company in the first place, he demanded to see the application form, which was such a poor forgery that both his and his wife&amp;#8217;s signature were clearly in the same handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the government repeatedly warning the public not to fall for financial scams, it&amp;#8217;s incredible that the HMRC fell for this one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So can we have a Treasury statement, so we can understand the extent of this problem, what&amp;#8217;s being done to prevent it in the future, and when constituents like mine will actually get their money from the HMRC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government response&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Well, I thank the Honourable Lady for raising this case. I&amp;#8217;m very sorry to hear that. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She may of course wish to raise it at Treasury questions on the 9th of May.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But given this is a sizable chunk of money for them to be out of pocket with, I will certainly raise this today with HMRC and ask them to contact the Honourable Lady with regard to this case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Extra Funding for Schools in Welwyn Hatfield Thanks to Conservative Government Investment</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.shapps.com/extra-funding-for-schools-in-welwyn-hatfield-thanks-to-conservative-government-investment/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=extra-funding-for-schools-in-welwyn-hatfield-thanks-to-conservative-government-investment" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, has welcomed extra funding from the Conservative Government which is providing schools in his constituency with £2,718,323 in extra funding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Every state school in England will receive extra cash following the additional £2 billion investment. The extra funding will deliver the highest real terms spending per pupil in history by 2024 –25. A typical primary school will receive approximately an extra £35,000 and a typical secondary school will receive an extra £200,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is delivering on the Conservative Government’s commitment to provide a world class education and deliver opportunity for all – wherever they come from and whatever their background – particularly those who face challenges or who need extra support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The remainder of the £2 billion funding boost will be used to increase Pupil Premium funding rates, which are rising by five per cent in 2023 &amp;#8211; 24. This extra funding will support disadvantaged pupils, local authorities’ high needs budgets, and special schools, making sure every child with special educational needs and disabilities receives the support and high-quality education they deserve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am hugely grateful to all our fantastic teachers, school leaders and support staff for all their incredible work and the immeasurable impact they have on the lives of children every day. Teachers must continue to have the resources they need, and this extra cash will make sure that they do.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“With school funding set to be at its highest ever level next year, even accounting for inflation, parents everywhere can be confident schools are being supported to let teachers get on and do what they do best &amp;#8211; teach.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps, thanked the Education Secretary for her support for schools in Welwyn Hatfield and expressed his commitment to schools in his constituency:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I welcome the extra funding for schools in Welwyn Hatfield from this Conservative Government. We are delivering on our commitment to provide a world-class education and deliver opportunity for all – wherever they come from and whatever their background.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social Security Health Assessments System has Contributed to the Deaths of Claimants</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">Social Security Health Assessments System <span style="color:#06396a;">Has Contributed to the Deaths of Claimants</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>The cross party Work and Pensions Select Committee responsible for scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) policies, has published a damning report on the Government’s health assessments system which is used to screen whether sick and disabled people should have access to vital social security payments.</p>
<p>These payments provide financial support to a working age person who is unable to work because of their health condition or disability; the assessment for this is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and is for either Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work. In addition there is also the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment process to access support to cover the extra costs disabled people face because of their disability which are estimated at over £580 a month on average; this is for the Personal Independence Payment.</p>
<p>The report exposed the detrimental impact of the assessment process itself on the health and well being of claimants.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the Committee, Professor Ben Barr, from the University of Liverpool, was asked about research he carried out in 2015 which looked at the impacts of the WCA as claimants were reassessed to move onto Employment Support Allowance. His analysis estimated that across England, the WCA had caused an additional 600 suicides, 300,000 additional cases of mental health problems and a large rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over a nine-year period.</p>
<p>“We looked at whether it could be explained by other factors or other economic trends, but there was quite a unique pattern in the increase in mental health problems, and the most likely explanation was that it was due to the reassessment process”, he told the committee. He said it is difficult to assess improvements since this study as “there are no systems in place” to monitor the impact of the health assessments and the potential adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>A survey by the University of Kent last year found half of claimants who have been through the WCA process said it made their mental health worse. Dr Ben Baumberg Geiger, who led the research, told the committee: “It is not sufficient to say that this is a historical problem and that everything is fine now. If there was more transparency, it would be easier to know a bit more about it, but the evidence suggests that there are still major problems with the WCA that could lead to an increased risk of poor mental health.”</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth and a Member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee said:</p>
<p><em>“The evidence is clear – the current system is not fit for purpose. The DWP’s own figures show that <strong><u>274 people a month</u></strong> <strong><u>die 6 months after being found fit for work </u></strong>and <strong><u>60 people a month die 3 months after having PIP refused. </u></strong>These are poorly people not the shirkers and scroungers that some Conservatives refer to when discussing social security claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“We heard evidence during the inquiry that when people were being reassessed between 2010 and 2013, there were 600 additional suicides. In 2020, National Audit Office has said that the claimant deaths that the DWP had investigated were the tip of the iceberg. The current approach is contributing, directly and indirectly, to the physical and mental health harm of claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“Last year the Equality Watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, issued a Section 23 order against the Department of Work and Pensions over their discriminatory treatment of disabled claimants.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Government itself has effectively acknowledged a different approach is needed when they announced that they would abolition the Work Capability Assessments, something I have been calling for years, but the detail of the future process is too opaque and doesn’t provide reassurance. Given it will take place several years to replace, what happens until then?</em></p>
<p><em>“I remain deeply concerned about these health assessments but also about the punitive nature of the sanctions regime, introduced in 2012 and, once again, on the rise. </em></p>
<p><em>“I believe it is these social security policies, as well as the inadequacy of the social security support especially for working age people, and the dehumanising culture that claimants too often experience that collectively contribute to the adverse health effects is the It is so detrimental to vulnerable people especially, but to all people as well.</em></p>
<p><em>“Given the failure of the Government to make many of the changes recommended in our predecessor Committee in 2018, I hold little hope in them taking on board the improvements set out in the report.”</em></p>

    <title>Llanelli Star Column – The challenges businesses face to survive, grow and create jobs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://niagriffith.org.uk/2023/04/llanelli-star-column-the-challenges-businesses-face-to-survive-grow-and-create-jobs/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In my roles as Member of Parliament for Llanelli and as Labour’s Shadow Minister for Exports, I am keen to meet with, and listen to, businesses to discuss the challenges they face and find out what they need to survive, grow and create sustainable, longer term jobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are crying out for a new UK
government that is pro-business, pro-worker and pro-trade, and has a plan to
boost export-led growth across the UK.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a recent
visit I made to the Gestamp factory in Felinfoel, I saw the progress made there
over the last decade or so.&amp;nbsp; When we
think of electric vehicles, we are often unaware of the development of the
tougher, lighter bodywork parts made right here in Llanelli, which contribute
so much to the safety and energy efficiency of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a
critical time for investment decisions in industry.&amp;nbsp; The United States Inflation Reduction Act is
a game changer in providing incentives for companies to invest in green
technologies.&amp;nbsp; Similar moves by major
European countries pose real challenges for the UK. We urgently need the UK
Government to step in with similar packages to make the UK the destination of
choice for firms like Gestamp and safeguard existing local jobs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is just one
of many examples where the current UK Government is leaving us fall
behind.&amp;nbsp; Our exports are down, there is a
gloomy outlook and many Brexit issues remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whilst the
current Tory UK Government is more concerned about themselves, Labour has
already set out a vision for a dynamic, trading Britain that seizes
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will continue
to provide more detail on this over the coming months.&amp;nbsp; As part of the that, I will keep visiting
local businesses, big and small, to find out from them exactly what they need
to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update on a few local matters.</p>
<p>First of all, for those of you intending to vote in the local elections in May, a reminder if you did not know, that you will need to take photo ID with you to the polling station. This is part of a new approach to avoid people impersonating someone else by voting in their name.</p>
<p>There are details on Council websites for Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead and what to do if you do not have a suitable form of ID.</p>

<h2>Stoneleigh Railway Crossing</h2>
<p>For those of you living in the Stoneleigh area, work is due to start soon on the new step free crossing over the railway at the station. I hope this will make things much easier for people with mobility issues, not to mention small children in buggies or heavy shopping bags.</p>
<p>This is a timetable for the planned work.</p>

<h2>One Day Travel Cards</h2>
<p>Transport for London has just announced that it is planning to scrap paper one day travelcards from outside London, which is likely to affect many people in our area. I will be lodging an objection to this, particularly as it is happening at the same time as the proposed ULEZ. If you want to find out more, they have published details at</p>

<p>Although the feedback form on this site is pretty limited, I would encourage you to share any opinions about the proposal via the link.</p>
<h2>Veterans Group</h2>
<p>In the last bulletin I gave you details of the support for veterans in Epsom and Ewell. I have been asked to remind those living in Mole Valley about the veterans hub for those living in the district, which is also providing valuable support locally. You can find out all the details at</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up :: 21 April 2023</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/04/21/weekly-round-up-21-april-2023/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-21-april-2023" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>I started the week in a session of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee discussing the work of the Civil Service Commission. We questioned Baroness Stuart on her first year as First Civil Service Commissioner. There were initially some concerns over her perceived impartiality as a politician in carrying out a role that has usually been held by former public servants. There has been a drop in temporary appointments, which had been made during Covid, and many more appointments now are permanent appointments to the civil service. Permanent appointments offer more stability for staff as well as value for money for taxpayers in the longer term. We need a civil service that is responsive to events in the real world, but we also need a stable civil service that is able to understand the long-term trends of the work that is needed across the UK and that comes best with permanent appointments and a high retention of staff. </p>
<p>There was the opportunity to talk to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman this week to find out about the work that they do. The Ombudsman makes final decisions on complaints that have not been resolved by NHS England and UK Government departments and other public organisations. They share their findings from their casework to help Parliament scrutinise public service providers and help drive improvements in public services and complaint handling. It is important that the Ombudsman is there not only to help the public find answers when other organisations are not providing the service they require but also to help us continually improve the services that we all pay into. </p>
<p>It was a pleasure to speak in a debate in Westminster Hall this week on the future of medicinal cannabis. The debate was about the economy and the possibilities for employment in a legitimate industry, however, we have not made much progress since 2018, despite those dedicated campaigners who have worked so hard. Notwithstanding the 2018 decision that medical cannabis could be used to help patients manage their symptoms, the trials and clinical research that would help the wider industry have moved at a glacial pace, so across the NHS, since 2018 only five people have been prescribed medical cannabis. That is ridiculously slow, and so many people have to go private. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that medicinal cannabis is available on the NHS for those who need it. People are suffering right now. We heard during the debate about children who are fitting, sometimes 100 times or more. Accessing care is, in some cases, pushing families to the brink of destitution. We should do everything we can to support those people.</p>
<p>This week I appeared on ITV West to discuss immigration and the Government’s priority to “stop the boats” which is simply a sticker plaster to a wider problem that the Government refuse to recognise. We’ve tried to amend previous legislation to try and break the business model for those trafficking people and work with National Crime Agency. But the government won’t take any long-term strategic look at this. The traffickers are able to exploit these vulnerable and desperate people because the Government has closed the legal routes to seek asylum in this country. </p>
<p>We also discussed housing in light of the decision by Homes England to grant planning permission for 260 homes on historic grassland in Bristol. Housing is my biggest casework issue, and we need to get the balance between building new and affordable homes and protecting our green spaces right. The pandemic showed us how important green space is for our physical and mental health but in order to get that balance right we need Conservative MPs in all areas to come to the table so that urban areas are not having to take all the responsibility for new housing and so that green space in urban areas is protected. </p>
<p>If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/04/21/weekly-round-up-21-april-2023/">Weekly Round-Up :: 21 April 2023</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

<p>The world’s first certified and transparent deepfake video has been created in a new bid to counter disinformation on the internet.</p>



<p>The video, of the AI expert Nina Schick warning about the dangers of the technology, contains the first industry watermark declaring it is a deepfake.</p>



<p>Deepfake videos are generated by artificial intelligence and can create lifelike representations of people, sometimes without their consent.</p>



<p>The technology is advancing at pace, with one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fake-surrender-video-intensifies-online-ukraine-war-vp2mhvq7s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Zelensky purporting to surrender</a>&nbsp;to Russia going viral in 2022. A pro-Chinese news channel featuring a pair of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/deepfake-newsreaders-pump-out-pro-china-news-gfthxjl0j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computer-generated presenters</a>&nbsp;was discovered this year in the first case of a state-aligned operation using deepfakes.</p>



<p>Concern over the spread of the AI has increased as new tools have emerged to make deepfakes&nbsp;easier, with consumers able to create videos using just text commands.</p>



<p>Deepfake pictures are also becoming more sophisticated with viral shots of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/donald-trump-deepfakes-ai-twitter-g50n7vnbm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump’s arrest</a>&nbsp;and the Pope in a puffer jacket circulating widely last week. However, there is greater concern over the impact of fake videos as the public is more inclined to believe them.</p>



<p>In the certified video, a lifelike representation of Schick made with her consent and using her voice asks: “What if we can no longer rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/falling-faker-makers-online-videos-kim-kardashian-p5bjzlwsd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">authenticity</a>&nbsp;of what we see and hear? We are at the dawn of artificial intelligence and already the lines of what is real and fiction are becoming blurred.”</p>



<p>The video has a cryptographic signature added to it that states it has been created with AI, who made it and when. This is connected to the video for its lifetime and any edits are made transparent. The viewer can see it in the top right of the screen under an “i” symbol.</p>



<p>The video was created by Truepic, a digital authenticity company, and Revel.ai, an AI studio used by Hollywood and the advertising industry.</p>



<p>Schick is hoping the video will “jolt” the tech and media industries into adopting the signature more widely.</p>



<p>“If you can’t trust digital media or any digital content then I think that’s an existential threat, not only to politicians or politics, but to business to society to everyone, because everyone has to exist in this ecosystem, we don’t really have a choice about it anymore,” she said.</p>



<p>“So part of this campaign is to show, to jolt, to force all the companies that are creating the models and creating AI-generated content, to start signing their content, to put transparency at the heart of generative AI. [It’s] also to start pushing platforms to adopt the open standard to ensure that we can see the authenticity of all content.”</p>



<p>Europe is looking to bring in tighter laws to regulate the technology and its draft AI Act stipulates that synthetic media should be labelled. The UK is looking at a more light-touch regulation.</p>



<p><strong>John Penrose, the Conservative MP who is campaigning for the Online Safety Bill to tackle disinformation, welcomed the push for AI watermarking.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“The Russians have already deepfaked a video of Zelensky urging Ukrainian troops to surrender, and the potential for disinformation undermining our elections and destroying trust in everything from the NHS to news reports and our justice system will only get worse,” he said.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Telling real pictures and videos from ever-improving fakes is essential, which is why being able to check where any image comes from, whether it has been altered and by who is vital. Otherwise we’ll never know if someone is trying to spin us a yarn or not.”</strong></p>



<p>Henry Ajder, an expert in generative AI, said widespread watermarking was the right strategy, adding: “Detection [of malicious deepfakes] is not going to be a viable approach at scale, whereas I feel that these approaches are viable at scale, or at least certainly much more. They have some challenges around implementation.</p>



<p>“But I think this is the best approach that’s available to us right now for verifying all content and providing a new standard, a new benchmark for how we understand trust in media.”</p>



<p>The AI watermarking technology has been developed to a new standard created by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), an industry body aiming to address the issue of digital transparency. Its steering members include the BBC, Adobe, Intel, Sony, Microsoft and Truepic.</p>



<p id="x_last-paragraph">Last week Adobe, which owns Photoshop, released Firefly, an AI image generator that tags its output with the C2PA information. Adobe is an investor in Truepic, to which Schick is an adviser.</p>

    <title>Tory failure to tackle sky-high inflation which hits the islands hardest</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2023/04/20/tory-failure-to-tackle-sky-high-inflation-which-hits-the-islands-hardest/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil says Rishi Sunak is ‘utterly failing’ to bring down inflation as it remains at a sky-high level hitting Na h-Eileanan an Iar even harder than other regions.</p>



<p>The latest figures from the ONS show inflation is still at an extortionately high rate of 10.1%. This is being driven by food inflation with the price of milk increasing by more than a third and ready meals increasing by a fifth.</p>



<p>Food prices in Na h-Eileanan an Iar are even higher than the UK average due to a number of factors, such as additional transportation on top of inflation rises.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has written to the constituency’s main supermarket, Co-op, for an explanation of the higher prices compared to other supermarkets. The Co-op stated the consistent pricing structure was offered across all stores regardless of the additional business costs incurred operating in remote locations.</p>



<p>The current inflation rise leaves the UK with one of the highest inflation rates amongst major economies, with Italy’s inflation rate at 8.2%, Germany 7.8%, France 6.6% and the USA 5.3%.</p>



<p>Inflation rates have stayed higher than previously predicted as economists expected it to drop below 10%. Rishi Sunak pledged at the start of this year to half inflation by the end of 2023.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “Households in Na h-Eileanan an Iar are still facing sky-high shopping and energy bills and it is down to Rishi Sunak and his Tory UK government as they are utterly failing to keep inflation under control.</p>



<p>“It is the Tories who caused this cost-of-living crisis and now they are doing next to nothing to ease the pressure on household budgets.</p>



<p>“Inflation in the UK remains high compared to other major European nations because of Brexit. Combined with the UK predicted to have the worst growth of any major economy, the UK is on a downward spiral all at the hands of Brexit.</p>



<p>“There will be no cause for comfort from a pro-Brexit Labour government either as they would keep Scotland out of the European Union, a market seven times the size of the UK’s, and the economic turmoil would continue.</p>



<p>“That is why the only way Scotland can escape the economic incompetence of Westminster control is by becoming an independent country and giving the people the option of re-joining the European Union.”</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-89/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/guarantee-our-essentials">Guarantee Our Essentials</a> event to listen to Ian from the Joseph Resolution Foundation (JRF), Jess from Trussell Trust (TT), and Sir Stephen Timms MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee discussing the proposal that the UK Government should introduce an Essentials Guarantee (EG), which would embed in our social security system the widely supported principle that at a minimum Universal Credit (UC) should protect people from going without essentials.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The JRF and TT research shows that 90% of households on UC are going without essentials, UC is now at its lowest level as a proportion of average earnings, 66% of the public believe UC is too low, almost 50% of households have their UC reduced by benefits deductions and caps. Inadequate social security is the main driver of food bank need. The TT gave out 1.3 million parcels between April and September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Essentials Guarantee, developed in line with public attitude insights, and focus groups, would ensure that this policy would enshrine in legislation:</p>
<ul>
<li>An independent process to regularly determine the EG level based on the cost of essentials, such as food, utilities, and vital household goods, for the adults in a household excluding rent and council tax.</li>
<li>That UC’s standard allowance must at least meet this level.</li>
<li>That deductions, such as debt repayments to UK Government, or as a result of the benefit cap, can never pull support below this level.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The JRF and TT analysis indicates it should be at least £120 for a single adult, and £200 for a couple.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of implementing the Essentials Guarantee would be an additional £22 billion a year in 2023-24, assuming full roll out of UC. The devastating effect of people going without essentials has a profound effect on our society, and our economy, and there will be savings to public services as a result of improved outcomes, not costed in this figure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Timms said that social security benefits are reviewed every year, but are not updated, and in real terms the current level is the lowest in 40 years. He said that his committee’s inquiry into the level of benefits will be reporting in the near future, and that low benefits are a problem for the economy because people take the first job offered, irrespective of matching their skills, so economic productivity is a problem. Stephen said that during the pandemic the UK Government provided money for a £20 week UC enhancement, and that should have continued. The UC uplift also prevented sanctions. Stephen said that benefits levels are not linked to anything logical, it’s an arbitrary figure, which is actually set at the deep poverty level, not the poverty level. And the gaps for under 25s are bigger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The event was very well attended, and there was agreement among speakers and attendees to support the EG proposals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-13/debates/97D4F67E-2C1B-44CB-B860-DD9024958EEF/IllegalMigrationBill">Illegal Migration Bill</a>. The Labour Party Reasoned Amendment to Second Reading of the Illegal Migration Bill was pushed to a vote at 10pm and was lost by 249-312 votes. The opposition parties voted against the Second Reading of the Bill and lost by 250-312 votes, against the Programme Motion and lost by 248-312 votes, and against the Money Motion and lost by 246-310 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Child Maintenance Services APPG, chaired by Jamie Stone MP, was held online and the guest speaker was Sir Stephen Timms MP who spoke about his Work and Pensions Committee enquiry into Children in Poverty, which will be published after Easter. He spoke about the themes of the enquiry which were formulated after taking evidence from witnesses at the committee. Gingerbread stated that for CMS, there are 1.9 million families caring for 1.9 million children, and single parent families are experiencing twice the rate of poverty as couples. If CM was paid in full it would lift 60% out of poverty.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parents receiving CM:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcement had improved but the National Audit Office (NAO) found it could be better. Half the payments are not made, so arrears are continually growing. There is scope for fraud in self-employed paying parents, and no enforcement for receiving parents. Domestic abusers exert control, especially in direct payments, so there is a need for legislation to stop this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcement is also very slow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parents paying CM:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rates of payment have not been updated since 1998.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The affordability of payments disincentivises paying parents to get work because they will have to increase payments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After paying, some are left with little money to live on.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There have been suicides among paying parents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Generally:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CM calculations are not accurate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Historic debts and CSA are included in payment calculations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is no explanation about how CM is assessed or calculated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CMS does not encourage settlement between parties, because there are winners and losers, but no compromise.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to the publication of the Work and Pensions Select Committee’s report.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called into the Cat Theft event hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Cats, and met representatives from Pet Theft Awareness which is an organisation dedicated to highlighting the growing threat of pet abduction within the public and Parliament. The Cat Theft Report 2022 consists of FOI requests about cat theft sent to all UK police forces from 2015-2021. Very little data previously existed before this report collated it from the forces that responded. The report found that during 2020-21, cat theft soared by 40% to an all time high of 560. But only 2 cases resulted in prosecution in 2021, which equates to 0.035%. The UK Government has decided to exclude cats from the pet abduction offence in the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, so cats will still be treated as inanimate objects under the Theft Act 1968, and their sentience is not recognised.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I joined the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Earth Hour UK event. On 25th March every year, millions of people around the world take time out of their busy lives to reflect on what nature means to them. Earth Hour is one of the largest movements for the planet, and gives us a chance to take a moment in solidarity, coming together to look after each other and our one shared home. We need to reset, recharge, and re-evaluate how we can continue standing up for our world every day. This year WWF UK are focusing closer to home on the amazing nature across the UK featured in the BBC series Wild Isles with Sir David Attenborough. The series focuses on the beautiful nature in the UK, and the need to protect the biodiversity, because unfortunately the UK is in the bottom 10% of global countries, where biodiversity is concerned.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-14/debates/12BE7356-3FDA-4474-8D0A-C0F3EC649E36/HS2RevisedTimetableAndBudget">Urgent Question (UQ) on HS2</a> was very well attended, and I stood hoping to be called by the Speaker. I was the penultimate person to be called, and I asked the Minister whether he accepted the Welsh Affairs Committee cross-party recommendation that HS2 is reclassified as an England-only project and Wales will then receive £5 billion Barnett Consequentials which will allow the Welsh Labour Government to continue to expand public transport services so that people in Wales will receive the same benefits from HS2 as those in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland? The Minister did not give a direct answer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG Western Gateway (WG) meeting was held so that members could have a confidential preview of WG’s 2050 vision to transform rail for South Wales and Western England, which will be launched at an event in Bristol on 23rd March 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the AGM of the APPG Western Rail Link, and was re-elected a vice-chair. Tan Dhesi MP for Slough was re-elected chair. The APPG has been campaigning for many years for a rail link to join Reading to Heathrow Airport, removing the necessity for passengers flying from Heathrow to take the train from West of the UK to Paddington in order to get the Heathrow Express from Paddington to Heathrow, or for passengers to get off the trains from the West of England or Wales at Reading, and get a bus from Reading to Heathrow. Unfortunately, this service doesn’t often link up as planned, and causes huge waiting times between rail and bus journeys. The proposed rail link will be 6.5km between GWR main line and Heathrow, taking 26 minutes, and will create 42,000 new jobs, with £1.5 billion savings to business. 20% of the UK would have access to Heathrow via one rail interchange, saving 30 million road miles per year, reducing congestion on M4, M3, and M25. It was announced by UK Government in 2012 as a nationally significant infrastructure project. It has widespread stakeholder and business support, and it has been fully costed, but is awaiting final planning approval and funding. Public consultation took place in 2018. A platform has already been built at Terminal 5 at Heathrow. The project stalled during Covid, but now is the time to resurrect the campaign so that passengers from the West who want to travel the world can enjoy direct travel to Heathrow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The AGM of the APPG on Autism was well attended, and I was re-elected a vice-chair. The Rt Hon Sir Robert Buckland MP was elected chair. Autism is a lifelong disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world. There are over 7000,000 autistic adults and children in the UK. Without support and understanding they will miss out on education, struggle to find work, and become isolated. The <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/">National Autistic Society</a> (NAS) transforms lives, changes attitudes to create a society that embraces autistic people. The Moonshot Vision is central to everything the NAS wants to achieve, and is the answer to the question “what does a society that works for autistic people look like?”. It consists of two parts: future realities and milestones along the way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the newly constituted APPG for Trade Justice, whose aim is to explore how trade has a real life impact, including how trade interacts with food standards, farming and animal welfare, environment and climate change, jobs and workers’ rights, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law, digital rights and online harm, public services, health and the NHS. I was elected a vice-chair. Members of the APPG received a briefing about the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), and its need of revision to face the challenges of the 21st century. The ECT was designed in the 1990s, with 50 signatories, but the ISDS in the treaty has been used by fossil fuel companies to sue governments for billions when governments try and curb dangerous global heating projects. The EU has been leading reform, but some member states have withdrawn completely from the ECT, and the European Commission advocates a full bloc withdrawal. The UK needs to withdraw from the ECT, or risk the UK Government being sued when it rejects applications for fossil fuel projects by multinational companies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called into the Payment Choice Alliance (PCA) drop in and learned about the campaign by the Payment Choice Alliance to empower voters to make their own payment decisions. Businesses are going cashless, and ATMs are declining. The PCA’s mission is that everyone should have the right to choose cash or card, banks should provide a free cash deposit and withdrawal machine, and better technology should be available that gives everyone opportunities to use their cash when they choose.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I bobbed during the newly created Department for Science, Innovation and Technology Oral Questions, and raised the superb R&amp;D facility being built as part of the Global Centre of Rail Excellence being developed in Onllwyn in Neath. <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-15/debates/AE6EEFA7-B392-46EA-B1A3-24B09376C82D/ResearchAndDevelopmentSector">I spoke about the GCRE</a> becoming the UK’s first net zero rail testing facility, rail innovation, testing and verification for mainline passenger and freight railways, developing next generation for the rail sector, and asked the new Minister Michelle Donelan MP if she would reconfirm her Government’s commitment to deliver £10 million for research and development at the GCRE. The new Minister stated that she was happy to meet me to discuss in detail the point I was raising. I have emailed Ms Donelan and formally requested a meeting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-15/debates/A0E6D8A4-816A-4130-A8BA-FF332B53C354/LocalHousingAllowance">Westminster Hall debate about Local Housing Allowance</a> (LHA) secured by the Honourable Member for Arfon, Hywel Williams MP. I stated that Wales is facing a housing crisis because there is a shortage of affordable properties that people can purchase or rent. The shortage forces many low-income families to move into a property they cannot afford, risking financial hardship, or into a property in poor condition, or seek assistance from homelessness services. Research by the Bevan Foundation found 51 properties advertised for rent in Neath in February 2023, but not one was covered by the LHA rate, which the UK Government has frozen since 2020 at 2018-19 private rental rates. The UK Government is responsible for determining the rate, and it must ensure that it covers the cost of renting a property. The chancellor could have used his Spring Budget to increase the rate, but he didn’t. He has not provided housing security, increased mental and physical illness amongst people struggling to pay their rent, or put food on the table, and put added pressure on local authorities trying to deliver frontline services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The House was sitting on Friday for Private Members’ Bills (PMB) and I was in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-17/debates/2810283D-E238-4512-95AB-42500F839550/HuntingTrophies(ImportProhibition)Bill">Chamber to support the Report Stage and Third Reading</a> of the PMB to Ban Trophy Hunting. I have been an officer of the APPG to Ban Trophy Hunting, chaired by Sir Roger Gale MP, for many years, and have been part of the campaign to ban the import of trophies taken by animal hunters into the UK. The founders of the campaign were my dear friends, Eduardo Goncalves, author of many books about the disgusting cruelty of trophy hunting, and the late Sir David Amess MP, who championed animal welfare throughout his time in Parliament. Despite the Bill having cross party and UK Government support, a few Conservative backbenchers had tabled 26 wrecking amendments in a tactic to prevent the Bill passing its stages in the Commons. The amendments were in the names of Sir Christopher Chope MP and Sir Bill Wiggins MP. If all or any of the amendments had been pushed to a vote, the Bill would have run out of time. The amendments’ proposers spoke about the false statistics produced by the campaign and highlighted in Eduardo’s books, and that trophy hunting was beneficial because the vast sums of money that Trophy hunters pay to kill defenceless wild animals helps to conserve lands in Africa. The Government Whip Rebecca Harries MP negotiated a compromise with the rebels that the UK Government would accept two of the amendments which would allow the Bill to pass without a vote. I <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-17/debates/2810283D-E238-4512-95AB-42500F839550/HuntingTrophies(ImportProhibition)Bill">intervened</a> on the Bill’s sponsor Henry Smith MP to state my constituency’s support for the Bill and commend Eduardo for founding the campaign and revealing the sordid world of killing sentient animals for entertainment. I also intervened on Sir David’s successor Anna Firth MP who was making a very emotional speech about Sir David to say how kind Sir David was to me since I became an MP in 2015, and how he encouraged me to become involved in animal welfare campaigns. The Minister Trudy Harrison MP pledged UK Government support, and that Bill passed through its Report and Third Reading stages, and has progressed to the Lords where it will proceed through similar stages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Rt Hon Chris Skidmore MP secured a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-21/debates/97E78295-CC1E-492F-ABD8-B570D781D2A2/EnergyCharterTreaty">thirty-minute debate</a> in Westminster Hall debate on the Energy Charter Treaty ECT. For thirty-minute debates, there are no other speakers apart from the proposer and the UK Government Minister, but members can make short interventions with prior permission from the proposer. I contacted Chris in advance, and he kindly gave me permission to make an intervention. Chris made the case for the UK to withdraw from the ECT as soon as possible. I made the point that if the UK cancels oil and gas projects it could face legal claims under the ISDS mechanism of the ECT of up to £9.4 billion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Skidmore MP was re-elected chair of the Environment APPG at its AGM, and I was re-elected one of the vice-chairs. The Green Alliance was confirmed as the secretariat for another 12 months.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the World Down’s Syndrome Day event hosted by Rt Hon Liam Fox MP who has been campaigning on behalf of Down’s Syndrome families for many years. It is nearly a year since the ground-breaking <a href="https://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/our-work/campaigning/the-down-syndrome-act/">Down Syndrome Act</a> became law, and people from all over the UK have contributed to the UK Government’s call for evidence from which the guidance will be drafted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the Fair Game event for South Wales MPs, sponsored by Jess Morden MP Newport East to listen to guest speakers: Niall Cooper, CEO of Fair Game; Mike Baker, Director of Advocacy, Fair Game, and it was hoped that John Scales former Liverpool player would attend, but unfortunately, he couldn’t make it. Fair game are a grassroots organisation who have engaged with football clubs across the UK and in South Wales. Their aim is to indentify problems, consult experts, to provide long term solutions. They believe that clubs are the hub of communities and should be helped to be sustainable, and offer men’s, women’s, children’s, and walking football. However, well run clubs are never rewarded. The speakers told us about the need to reform financial and governance structures in football to make the game work for supporters at all levels following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-securing-the-games-future">White Paper on Football Governance</a> and the <a href="https://thefsa.org.uk/our-work/fan-led-review/">Fan Led Review</a>. The speakers told us that the White Paper is supposed to improve the game, but there is pressure to weaken the proposals. That the equality standards and environmental proposals were in the review but are not in the White Paper. That there should be financial distribution from the top clubs down across the bottom pyramid clubs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meg Hillier MP hosted an event in Parliament to <a href="https://www.nrpfnetwork.org.uk/nrpf-connect/nrpf-connect-data">launch a report</a> published by IPPR, Praxis, and Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, GMIAU on the impact of the long, costly, 10-year route to settlement, of which most people are subject to No Recourse to Public Funds. The report interviewed 300 people on this route, and found that: more than 50% struggle with affording bills and food; over 20% faced housing problems, and sofa surfed, or were rough sleeping; 41% borrow from family or friends to pay the costs of the application; 75% wouldn’t be able to pay the cost of permanent residency even if they fulfill all the demoing criteria, because they can’t afford the fee; and 28% stated that the 10-year route made it harder for them to keep their job. For people who do not meet the 5-year criteria, they have to pursue the 10-year route, but have to reapply to the Home Office every 2 and a half years, which costs £13,000 for an adult, and £11,000 for a child under 16. The applications are complex and there is very limited access to legal aid. If an applicant loses their immigration status, due to making a mistake in the application (38%) or not affording the fee (37%), they have to start the 10-year process again. The majority of people are women, mothers, carers, and from black and ethnic minorities. The process for applicants causes 66% to have mental health problems, There is a need for an urgent review of this process in the context of a wider immigration review because people have to save any money they have to pay the fees, and have no money, food, clothes. The costly fees are paid to the Home Office for “administrative charges”, but the majority of applicants’ status do not change during the two and half year interval between applications, so it is a “tick box” exercise. The real costs are estimated to be a third of the fees. The 10 year route is killing people and the UK Government must find a better, more humane method for people who have lived in the UK for over 10 years (60 %) or 20 years (20%), to be granted settled status.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-trade/about-our-services">Department for Business and Trade DBT</a> held an Expert Showcase event in Parliament. Andrew Mitchell, Director General of UK Exports and Trade, spoke about the Export Academy, Export Finance, Export Credit Agency, and introduced speakers. The Welsh representative was the very famous Welsh Expert Exporter Stephen Davies, CEO of Penderyn Whisky, who spoke about the growing export success of Penderyn and their increasing range of products that are seen all over the world. Stephen said that they started the company 20 years ago, and now have 100 employees in North and South Wales, and are opening a new factory in Swansea in the near future. His challenge is to find partners across the world to grow the exporting branch of the business. The UK Government Trade Minister Kevin Hollinrake MP spoke about his Government’s policy to race to a trillion exports by 2030s, with an export strategy and a 12-year plan. Richard Graham MP spoke about being one of the UK Government’s Trade Envoys. I learned about the support available to exporters and potential exporters for Neath businesses from the Welsh Government representative Tony Hicks and Mia Rees DBT, and I shall be meeting the two regional Trade Advisers, Jan Morgan and Trygve Rees, that cover the Neath area in the near future to find out the range of support available to businesses in Neath.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected as a vice-chair at the AGM of the APPG for Multiple Sclerosis, and Charlotte Nichols MP was elected as the new chair. There are nearly 140,000 people with MS in the UK and 5,680 people in Wales. It will be the 70th Anniversary of the MS Society this year, and the APPG plans to spotlight some of the challenges that face people with MS today, and the opportunity offered by cutting edge research. The APPG will discuss findings from <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/our-work/our-evidence/my-ms-my-needs">My MS My Needs</a> 4 treatments and services for progressive MS. There will be a round table event on mental health support with the MS Society and other MS charities in May. And there should be reform to the welfare system reducing barriers to accessing support and benefits for MS sufferers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the APPG for Drugs Alcohol &amp; Justice (DAJ) meeting we held a minute silence for our vice-chair Baroness Marsham who had recently passed away. Then we took part in a roundtable discussion on drug &amp; alcohol treatment and recovery in prison, chaired by my dear friend Dan Carden MP, and coordinated by my friend Richard Hanford.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The speakers were:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Trace, CEO, Forward Trust (formally Addictive Diseases Trust ADT) which was launched in 1991 with its first intensive drug rehab programme in HMP Downview funded from charities and donations. The prison service commissioned an independent study of their Substance Abuse Treatment Programme in 1994, and the graduates reported unanimously that the treatment had altered their lives and stopped them reoffending and also improved their personal relationships. In 1995 Lord Justice Woolf commended the programme in Parliament, which helped to secure future funding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Scott, Criminal Justice Manager, Humankind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">John, a prisoner who turned his life around following 30 years of repeat offending to obtain money for drugs, but the ADT programme he completed in Downview (which he calls Brownview!) prison in 1991 stopped him reoffending.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen, a prisoner who stopped 20 years of reoffending to get money for drogs every time  he was released through completing a Restorative Justice (RJ) programme.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mike spoke about universal truths, that there is a high proportion of drug and alcohol offending, and early intervention is crucial. There’s a cohort of 200,000 repeat offenders. The Morgan Report 2011-12 is still the only national review that has been produced. For 40 years there was a scattergun approach, but in the 1999 UK Government budget, funding was provided for treatment programmes to stop drugs and alcohol addiction in every prison. There were 120 prisons and there were 100 programmes operating by 2010, but unfortunately these ceased in 2012. The MOJ transferred the programmes from the MOJ to the NHS budget, and all the learning of the previous decade was lost. The wing drug dealers have increased in the last decade, and the MOJ is not creating an environment where prisoners choose to have treatment. Services are massively stretched. The Carol Black Report includes recommendations that are excellent, but the report has been stalled since it’s been with the current UK Government Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab MP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Scott, prison support service manager at Humankind Charity, which was registered in 1984, whose aim is to focus on vocational preparation programmes for young and unemployed in County Durham, and has worked with youth and adult offenders since the late 1980s. In 2019 it merged with Blenheim CDP Charity and EDP joined them in 2020. Humankind has 1400 staff and 100 volunteers providing services to over 85000 people, including substance misuse, clinical services, employment training, education, housing, and health and wellbeing. Jessica spoke about the 7 North East Prisons she oversees. Humankind offers psychosocial support. Detox and alopharma given at the start of a sentence. The drug espranol is used as a blocker, and buvidal is given by injection which is prescribed for a week or a month and which allows ex-prisoners to work normal hours when they get a job on release, without having to go to a pharmacy every day to get methadone. Naloxone, an opiate reversal, is given out when prisoners are released, and is now available as a nasal spray, which helps them to avoid using needles. Peer mentors are brought into prison, because it’s more effective for former prisoners who have recovered to encourage prisoners who are trying to recover. In June they will open a reconnect hub outside HMP Durham to help former prisoners not succcombing to the drugs and alcohol culture on release. This service will be available all hours to former prisoners whenever needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen spoke about reoffending over 30 years and what turned his life around was RJ. But if prisoners choose RJ there is retribution from the prison wing gangs who pick on the vulnerable and don’t like their drugs trade decreasing because prisoners want to be cured. He saw so much self-harm and suicide in prison that he had to change. It was RJ that succeeded where other programmes failed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">John is a graduate of the ADT (now Forward Trust) programme and now delivers the programme. He was on the first ADT programme in 1991 in Downview, and delivering the programme keeps him sane, and is therapy for him. He told us about the Minnesota 12-step programme.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice chair of the APPG for RJ I was very encouraged to listen to Stephen’s positive experience of RJ, and I was delighted that Dan Carden MP said he would like his APPG to work with us to promote RJ.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I also signed EDM 950, about women’s drug and alcohol treatment created by Rachael Maskell MP, who is another good friend and a member of the APPG DAJ.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice chair of the APPG Music I attended the superb event “Whose Song is it Anyway – Women in Music” Launch with Dr Hayleigh Bosher, Brunel University, London, hosted by the chair of the APPG and my dear friend Kevin Brennan MP, who is himself a very talented singer songwriter and a founder member of the group MP4, which is made up of 4 cross-party MPs. The event was made up of speeches, round tables, and artists who performed live.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair for the APPG Music, I always enjoy our meetings. This We had an update from UK Music, about BBC cuts, the increasing cost of US visas, copyright consequences for AI, and plans to consult with Parties ahead of their manifestos for the next General Election. We had a presentation from BPI, the record label’s voice in the UK for Universal, Warner, and Sony. The UK is the third largest recorded music market in the world. The BPI set up the Brit School in Croydon, and East London Arts and Music in Bow. The UK Government started the free school funding process in June 2022, and the BPI has bid to set up a Northern Brit School in Bradford for 16-19 year olds for an immersive creative environment in cross disciplines including music, tech, performance, dance, production, film, digital design but also maths and English GCSEs. There is support from Tracy Brabin MP, the Leader of Bradford Council, CEO of Bradford MDC, and Bradford will be the City of Culture in 2025.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Entain and SportAid drop-in event to meet some of the athletes sponsored by these partnership organisations. SportsAid is a national charity founded to help Great Britain’s brightest sporting prospects who aspire to be the next Olympic, Paralympic, Commonwealth and World Champions, by providing grants to help with training and competition costs, and mentoring by professional athletes. Entain is one of the largest sports betting and gaming groups, which supports grassroots and professional sport across the UK through its Entain Foundation. SportsAid and Entain have been partners since 2019, and have provided 200 British budding stars with financial awards. The partnership has been extended to 2024, and will support an additional 100 athletes in their sporting careers. I met up with my friend Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of Sport Wales, who is a former national, commonwealth and paralympic athlete, and an amazing advocate for all sport.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The main <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-27/debates/5D4369C7-D5F5-42D5-B8DF-462BC5DDA601/IllegalMigrationBill">business in the chamber</a> was the first day of the Illegal Migration Bill, with six-hour protected time for the debate. There were many amendments and new clauses spoken to in the debate, and some were pushed to a vote by the proposers. The votes started at 10pm, and the opposition voted for amendment 76, and lost 244-308; abstained on SNP New Clause 6, which was lost 67-307; supported New Clause 24, which was lost by 248-301; and voted for New Clause 25, which was lost by 196-306.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The GWR event was supported by Network Rail Wales, Western Gateway, Transport for Wales, Crosscountry Trains, and was hosted by Rt Hon Theresa May MP. Many parliamentarians turned up to hear about the future plans for rail in Wales and the borders by the organisations. GWR unveiled its <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/service_disruptions/48.aspx">new timetable</a> starting next month with extra mainline services on most routes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Parliamentary drop-in on reform of the Dangerous Dogs Act, hosted by my old school friend Wayne David MP. Emma Whitfield, the mother of 10-year-old Jack Lis who was tragically killed by a dangerous dog in November 2021, was at the event and bravely spoke about the effect that Jack’s death had had on her and her family. There were also a number of experts at the event who spoke about how the Act does not work, and the need for reform – Dr Sam Gaines, Head of Companion Animals, RSPCA; Claire Calder, Chair of the Dogs Control Coalition, and Head of Public Affairs, Dogs Trust; Dr Marc Abraham OBE, chair of the All-Party Dog Advisory Welfare Group; and Vanessa Walden, co founder of Hope Rescue Centre, Llanharan. Over the last 12 months, 12 people across the UK have died after being attacked by a dangerous dog. I <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-06/debates/E7DC68B3-E1E5-449B-B922-F3333187C8FB/Breed-SpecificLegislation">opened the debate on Breed Specific Legislation</a> which specified proposals to reform the Act, with input from the expert speakers who attended the event, on behalf of the Petitions Committee on 6th June 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG for Restorative Justice met to receive a presentation from the Youth Justice Board UK, and to discuss progress on updates from the APPG Advisory Group, from its chair Jim Simon, and review the evidence gathered for the work streams on health and social care, and education, emanating from our Inquiry Report published in September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Robbie and Gwen from Uplift UK who will be the new secretariat for the relaunch of the Climate Change APPG, which will be chaired by Caroline Lucas MP. Barry Gardiner MP and I have agreed to become vice-chairs. Uplift UK’s mission is to support and energise the movement for a just and fossil fuel-free UK. At the meeting we discussed plans for raising the importance of climate change, and how the UK Government needs to take a more progressive stance to reach its climate change targets. The Welsh Labour Government was the first government to set up a climate change department, led by Minister Julie James MS for Swansea West, and Deputy Minister Lee Waters MS for Llanelli. I suggested that the APPG should visit the Global Centre of Rail Excellence, which is being developed in Neath, which will be the first net zero test facility for rail in the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-28/debates/6F481923-B613-4807-BD4B-B1ED72AC3A75/IllegalMigrationBill">second day of the Illegal Migration Bill</a>, and many more amendments and clauses were debated for six hours. The votes started just before 8pm. The opposition supported amendment 189 to exempt Afghan Nationals from the provisions in the Bill, but this was defeated by 242 to 309 votes. We voted against New Clause 11, and lost 242 to 302 votes; supported amendment 288, and lost by 248 to 299 votes; supported New Clause 21 and lost by 249-301; snd supported New Clause 27, but lost this by 248-301.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to be re-elected a vice-chair at the AGM of the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) APPG. Andrew Lewer MP was re-elected as the chair. We listened to a presentation from the MND Research Institute about funding streams and research trials for new medicines being developed to arrest the progression of MND.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the Parkinson’s APPG I attended the Parkinson’s World Day event with the former chair and my very dear friend Baroness Anita Gale. The theme for World Parkinson’s Day which was on 11th April is “finding the bright and the brilliant”. There are currently 145,000 people living with Parkinson’s in the UK, which will increase to 172,000 by 2030. The most common symptoms are freezing, tremor, painful muscle cramps, difficulty speaking, anxiety and depression. Parkinson’s is the fastest growing neurodegenerative condition in the world, but the health and social care workforce is already under resourced and overstretched. In Wales there are currently just over 25 whole time equivalent Parkinson’s nurses. Areas for improvement across the UK include: specialised multidisciplinary working; standardised practice; communication and information sharing; medicines management and educating the workforce. Heath and Social Care is devolved to Wales and Parkinson’s UK Cymru are raising issues with the Senedd and Welsh Government, led by Rachel Williams, Policy Campaigns and Communications Manager Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-29/debates/5C3EDB22-A3C3-4FE7-8A2B-98B52833D063/SpringBudgetWales">Westminster Hall Debate about the Spring Budget in Wales</a> which was a 90 minute debate secured by my friend Ruth Jones MP for Newport West. I raised issues about the cost of living crisis that the people of Wales are suffering after 13 years of Tory policies, and the urgent need for the UK Government to reform Local Housing Allowance and Universal Credit. Local Housing Allowance (LHA) was introduced in 2008, and is the amount of housing benefit or the housing element of Universal Credit (UC), available to people who are renting from private landlords, which is based on the area in which the person lives, and the number of bedrooms they require. LHA rates have been frozen since 2020 at 2018-19 rates, and research by the Bevan Foundation found that in my Neath Constituency there were 51 properties advertised to rent in February 2023, but not one property was fully covered by the LHA rate. People are faced with the choice of putting food on the table, or paying their rent, risking homelessness. The Chancellor could have used his Spring Budget to increase the LHA rates, but he didn’t. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation recently launched its research on an Essentials Guarantee which would reform Universal Credit to ensure people can afford the essentials, food and non-alcoholic drink, electricity and gas, water, clothes and shoes, communications, sundries such as cleaning materials, during hard times. This was calculated to be £120 a week for a single person over 25, which is £35 more than UC, and £200 for a couple over 35, which is £66 more than UC, from April 2023. The Trussel Trust support these proposals and its data show that inadequate Social Security is the main driver of food bank need, having given out 1.3 million food parcels between April and September 2022. Universal Credit urgently needs reforming because it is not preventing widespread poverty, but yet again the Chancellor didn’t address the inadequacy of UC in his Spring Budget. He could have at least reinstated the £20 per week uplift that was implemented during the Covid pandemic. I finished my speech by urging the UK Government to reclassify HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail as England only projects so that Wales will receive Barnett Consequentials, and I asked the Minister when his UK Government will pay the outstanding £10 million for the R&amp;D department of the GCRE. Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any commitments for reform of LHA, nor UC, and no answer to the GCRE monies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-29/debates/EE76DD85-892D-424D-87B1-50B933FEDF36/Finance(No2)Bill">Second Reading of the Finance Bill (no2),</a> which started at 2pm and was voted on at just after 6pm. The Official Opposition had tabled a Reasoned Amendment which was pushed to a vote and was defeated by 211-289 votes. And the Second Reading of the Bill was not opposed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I became very emotional at the Marie Curie led Day of National Reflection which aims to bring together communities, and organisations across the UK to remember family, friends, colleagues who have died, support those who are grieving, and give communities a space to talk openly about death and dying. Whether sudden or expected, the death of someone we care about can be completely devastating and recent times have reminded us that no one should have to go through it alone. Marie Curie was a steering group member of the independent UK Commission on Bereavement established to explore challenges and solutions to better support bereaved people across all four nations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Commission made 4 recommendations:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Governments in all four nations must commit: 6p per person to develop resources and evaluate cross sector collaborative initiatives which must reflect needs of communities across the UK and prioritise underserved population groups; 79p annually per person to transform bereavement services over the next 5 years, particularly focusing on racialised, ethnic and other marginalised communities; conduct a review of the information flow from death registration to relevant public bodies; and the UK Government should establish and deliver a cross departmental strategy for bereavement that recognises support following bereavement as a human right. I spoke about the sudden death of my brother James just before Christmas, which has left me devastated.</p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP welcomes school debaters to Downing Street</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2023/03/29/matt-warman-mp-welcomes-school-debaters-to-downing-street/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-4189 aligncenter" srcset="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png 300w, https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the visit &lt;strong&gt;Matt Warman MP commented&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith&lt;/strong&gt; who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Budget Special Newsletter:</h1>



<p>Earlier this week I was in the House of Commons to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Spring Budget. You can watch my speech in response&nbsp;<a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/9a2782e4-5f86-4a9d-8dcd-b6767b517c25?in=17:31:37">here</a>. Following the financial turmoil last Autumn this wasn’t expected to be a dramatic budget, but the improving position of the economy enabled the Chancellor to make some significant announcements.</p>



<p>The good economic news was that we are no longer forecast to enter recession this year and inflation is forecast to be below 3% by Christmas, a significant reduction on the current position of over 10% and a sign that the tough measures taken to stabilise the economy are working.</p>



<p>I welcome the focus of the Spring Budget on the everyday costs of average working families and support for services and businesses which are central to our communities. I am also pleased that much of this support will be going towards families and individuals here in Amber Valley, saving them money on their bills, fuel prices, childcare and allowing them to benefit from broader economic investment and growth.</p>



<p>The main announcements were:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Extending Energy Bills Support:</h2>



<p>The Energy Price Guarantee, which has capped energy bills for households across the UK at an average of £2,500 a year will be extended for 3 months to the end of June 2023 saving the average household £160. Bills are forecast to fall below this level from July. In my speech following the Budget I urged the Chancellor to extend this to next March in the event prices don’t fall as expected so we all have certainty over what we will pay next winter.</p>



<p>Additionally, houses on prepayments meters are set to see an even greater benefit, as the Government is ending Prepayment Meter premium, ensuring that the prices these customers pay are in line with those on direct debit schemes. Forced prepayment meter installations are also suspended, ensuring those struggling to pay are not being taken advantage of by energy companies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056786.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fuel Duty frozen:</h2>



<p>The freeze on Fuel Duty is also set to be extended for 2023, cancelling the planned 11p rise. The Government will also be maintaining the 5p cut on fuel duty for a further 12 months. While prices have fallen back from the peak, they are still high and freezing the duty will save motorists up to £200 this year. I know this will be welcomed by all those of you who have recently written to me in favour of keeping fuel duty frozen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056811.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making childcare more affordable:</h2>



<p>I know only too well how large a burden the cost of childcare for under 3s is, in many cases making working impossible. Parents also have challenges in Amber Valley finding places.</p>



<p>The Spring Budget includes a number of reforms to reduce childcare costs for working families, allowing parents to return to work should they wish. Free childcare is being extended to young families with children between 9 months and 3 years (from when 30 hours free is currently provided). Families where all adults work over 16 hours a week will be entitled to up to 30 hours of free childcare – this is being phased in from next Spring to ensure sufficient spaces are available.</p>



<p>For those on Universal Credit who wish to return to work, we are increasing the maximum claim limits up to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children and allowing parents to be paid upfront rather than having to pay the cost themselves first.</p>



<p>In order to boost the number of childminders and increase the provision of childcare services, the Government is introducing an incentive of £600 for new child-minders and up to £1200 for those who join the profession through an agency. An additional £204 million is also being provided to fund nurseries which are offering free childcare hours.</p>



<p>And finally, we are increasing funding so primary schools can provide wrap around childcare between 8am and 6pm.</p>



<p>I welcome this support being given to young working families and am pleased that these policies have been introduced following recommendations by myself and my colleagues on the Work and Pensions Select Committee in a recent report.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056839.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting our pubs:</h2>



<p>Pubs in Amber Valley will also benefit from the Budget, helping these establishments continue to play an important role in our town centres and our communities. While the new Alcohol Duty rates will be introduced for alcoholic drinks in supermarkets in August, pubs will be able to keep their prices down due to Draught Relief being raised from 5% to 9.2%.</p>



<p>This means that the price of an average draught pint of beer served in a pub will not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than in supermarkets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056856.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fixing potholes in Derbyshire:</h2>



<p>Many residents of Amber Valley will also be pleased to hear that there will be an expansion of the funding being assigned to fix potholes. The Government is allocating an additional £200 million to fix potholes, which is the equivalent of 4 million potholes being fixed across the UK. Derbyshire’s share of this is £4.2m.</p>



<p>If you know of any potholes that need fixing, please send me an email via my Street Watch reporting below and we’ll report them to the Council.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056873.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting leisure centres &amp; keeping pools warm:</h2>



<p>We are lucky enough to have 3 leisure centres here in Amber Valley, and I welcome the support being given to help them keep their heating costs down and continue to provide fun healthy activities and spaces for everyone in Amber Valley. The Government has announced it is allocated £63 million to a support fund for leisure centres to access, in order to help them keep our pools warm and pay their energy bills.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056891.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Universal Support Scheme:</h2>



<p>I am pleased that reforms are being introduced to separate benefits entitlement from ability to work for those on disability support. Too long this has stopped those on disability benefits from working, for fear of losing financial support. The Government wants to help those who wish to work but are held back by their disability. To do this they are providing Universal Support up to £4000 per person to help these individuals find jobs and make the necessary adjustments to allow them to enter the workforce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056905.jpg" alt=""/></figure>

    <title>Put an end to postcode lottery for bone health, demands Judith</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/put-an-end-to-postcode-lottery-for-bone-health-demands-judith-cummins-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cummins MP on Tuesday called for the government to step up and provide 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services in England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a long-term health condition characterised by weak bones prone to breaking or fracture. It affects 3.5m people across the UK: a fifth of men and half of women over 50.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A report by the Royal Osteoporosis Society found that 90,000 people miss out on the treatment every year and some 2.2 million people in the UK are left with undiagnosed spinal fractures. Fracture Liaison Services&amp;nbsp;are an essential means of identifying and treating osteoporosis early. Yet, only 57% of people in England have access to this quality of life improving service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the Chamber, Judith called on the government to provide the necessary services, which could prevent over thirty thousand hip fractures by identifying bone problems early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An investment of just £27 million per year in Fracture Liaison Services would deliver over £600 million in savings over five years for the NHS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Will the Minister meet with me and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, to discuss our report, and commit to ending the postcode lottery by providing 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services for over-50s in England?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Secretary of State for Health Steve Barclay MP agreed: “Obviously, she sets out a very compelling case in terms of the return on investment. Clearly, we will need to scrutinise that in more detail.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_03_07-FLS-ROS-Health-Q.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Judith hears from the Health Secretary there is a &amp;#8216;compelling case&amp;#8217; for investing in FLS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith emphasized the need to act now to ensure that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and people are not unnecessarily left in pain with debilitating fractures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bradford has an exemplary fracture liaison service, but almost half of the country must do without. When these early opportunities to prevent fractures are missed there is a greater pressure on ambulances, acute hospital bed days, and greater stress on the NHS.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By acting now to provide full Fracture Liaison Services coverage right across England, we can save people unnecessary pain, save the NHS vital resources, and give all patients the level of care they deserve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title type="text">Compensation package for Waspi women</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="213" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Labour has pledged compensation packages for millions of women hit by state pension age rises imposed by the Tories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a historic debt of honour to them.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
