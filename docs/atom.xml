    <title>The Chancellor’s wish to see greater productivity in public services</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2023/07/22/the-chancellors-wish-to-see-greater-productivity-in-public-services/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor gave an important lecture recently on the need to raise public sector productivity. He drew attention to the decline in public service productivity by 5.7% compared to pre pandemic, whilst private services had shown a productivity improvement of 1.7% over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raised the issue of the &amp;#8220;10,000 public workers in equality, diversity and inclusion&amp;#8221; wondering if this was too many. I would add why did the NHS recruit more than 3,500 additional managers over the last three years? How did their appointment coincide with a major decline in productivity and what are they doing about it? How many new forms and requirements have these additional managers imposed on the front line staff? Why do we have duplicate or triplicate  management, with management at NHS England levels, management at regional NHS quango level and management at hospital or GP Trust level? Why is there a cadre of senior NHS managers in the Department of Health and another corps of senior managers in  NHS England? How many requirements on NHS trusts do these bodies send out each year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When staff morale is low as it has been in the NHS with strikes and disputes over working conditions as well as about pay it implies the senior management have  not listened and led in the way they should. It took senior management a very long time to come up with a manpower plan. Given the dominance of the NHS in the UK health area it is important the NHS does enough to stimulate sufficient education and training of our future health practitioners. That will take time and is not enough by way of response to current troubles. The senior management need to rework rotas, shifts, working practices and conditions with their medical teams to win back the loyalty and support of the staff. There is the danger of losing too many experienced and good people over  conditions and job gradings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="hs_Para"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Vilnius, the Prime Minister had the chance to conclude a deal allowing our scientists to participate in the world’s biggest international science programme, driving innovation and sustainable growth. He did not take it, again, so the Horizon saga drags on, month after month, year after year. Are we in or are we out? The Science Minister is not in the negotiations, and the chief scientist is not in the negotiations. It is all about the Prime Minister. Does the Secretary of State understand that while the Prime Minister is dithering, our science base is withering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><span><span><span>That’s why, yesterday, I sought a briefing from Vattenfall, who confirmed that, while they remain committed to the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, they are indeed stopping the current development track for the Norfolk Boreas project due to rapidly rising costs since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine last year. They will continue to evaluate the best way forward for Boreas, as well as its sister project Norfolk Vanguard – also part of the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In the meantime, work will continue onshore with Vattenfall’s already underway preparatory activity and enabling works for both projects along the cable corridor and around the site of the planned substations in Necton – which is why I still intend to visit their Community Event in the village this afternoon to speak to officials and ensure Mid Norfolk’s voice is being heard.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to follow the developing situation very closely.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>To see the EDP articles on Vattenfall’s announcement, please click <a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23667775.vattenfall-norfolk-boreas-wind-farm-scheme-halted/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23669132.norfolk-boreas-wind-farm-scheme-halted-vattenfall/">here</a>.</span></span></span></p>

&lt;p&gt;Community campaigners from Llanelli have visited the Home
Office in London this week to hand deliver a letter directly to UK Government
Ministers calling for them to think again about using the Stradey Park Hotel as
emergency accommodation for over 200 asylum seekers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The delegation, led by the town’s MP, Nia Griffith,
included Llanelli Town Council’s Leader Cllr David Darkin and Cllr Lillith
Fenris, Carmarthenshire County Councillor Martyn Palfreman whose Hengoed Ward
covers the Stradey Park Hotel site itself, Llanelli Rural Council’s Cllr Bethan
Williams and local resident Steve Kelshaw.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the letter to Tory Home Secretary Suella Braverman,
Llanelli MP Nia Griffith outlined the strength of opposition to the proposal
and the complete lack of consultation with the public or consideration of how
such numbers could be absorbed in the Furnace area by already stretched public
services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also criticised how the situation has been handled by
the Home Office, Clearsprings ReadyHomes and the hotel’s owners and confirmed
that there was considerable anger and dismay amongst residents about being
treated in such a dismissive way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other points raised included the plight of the hotel’s
employees who lost their jobs as a result, those couples and families that have
had weddings and other events cancelled at short notice and the loss of such an
important tourist and economic facility to the town.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the letter and the need to continue
pressing the Home Office to reverse their decision, Llanelli MP Nia Griffith
said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The use of the Stradey Park Hotel for this is just not
sensible or practical.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People have genuine concerns about how public services
will cope with increasing the population of Furnace by around 50% all in one go
and what effect it will have on a tight knit community.&amp;nbsp; The complete
silence from those involved in driving this proposal has led to fear and
uncertainty amongst local residents..There are also unresolved issues around
access to the site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is still not too late for the Home Office to drop this
ill thought out and disastrous plan.&amp;nbsp; Our letter is calling for exactly
that and for them to consider alternative models instead such as the dispersal
programmes, which have been already used to good effect in Llanelli and other
areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also calls on the UK Government to accelerate clearing the backlog of asylum seekers, so as to reduce the need for additional hotel accommodation.  This situation is only happening at all due to the ongoing incompetence of Tory Ministers who have lost control of the system completely.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Last week, I led a parliamentary debate on ending animal testing for new drugs and medicines. It&#8217;s a controversial subject with renewed interest since news that, after a 25-year ban, the government has agreed to resume some tests for cosmetic ingredients.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll confess that, despite knowing how strongly people feel about animal testing, I&#8217;ve been inclined to defend it when told it could lead to new cures and treatments for conditions which cause human death and suffering.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve changed my mind since meeting with Animal Free Research UK and scientists at the Institute of Translational Medicine at the University of Birmingham. I discovered that 92% of drugs and treatments that show promise during animal tests fail to successfully translate to safe and effective human medicines. This is because animal biology is very different to humans. Equally important, we&#8217;re now capable of producing better tests, based on human biology and new technologies. Liver-on-a-chip (micro-chip) technology has a far greater success rate in predicting whether a new medicine will prove toxic to the human liver than any animal experiment.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a rapidly growing sector which can create jobs for the future and where Britain can take a significant lead. Several companies are already based here but the USA is making huge inroads and might leave the British research behind unless we act quickly. There&#8217;s little doubt that the work of the Precision Health Technologies Accelerator in my Selly Oak constituency could be a real gamechanger.</p>



<p>One experiment I witnessed in Birmingham involves a lab model of a human cornea which researchers hope will allow real advances in treating eye conditions and perhaps lead to restoring the sight of some who have gone blind.</p>



<p>As with all exciting initiatives, we need government support. Now is the time to get behind this work, phase out animal research and ensure that a city like ours becomes a world leader.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">In the spirit of supporting all women’s sport at all levels, in all countries, I attended the reception hosted by The Football Association for the Lionesses, England Women’s Football team, ahead of the FIFA World Cup in Australia and New Zealand starting on 20th July. My friend Tracey Crouch MP hosted the event, at which the guests were Secretary of State for Education Gillian Keegan MP, FA’s Director of Women’s Football, Baroness Sue Campbell, and England Women record goal scorer, Ellen White MBE. It’s gratifying to know how much the women’s game has grown in support and funding, and at senior level, Wales Women Football team has improved so much, despite being semi-professional, and having a smaller population to choose from than England. I am encouraged to learn that grassroots female football in Wales has blossomed due to the success of the senior national team, especially the junior girls’ structure, which is a good sign for the future of football in Wales. I was so disappointed to see Wales just miss out on qualification for the World Cup, but after reaching the play-off final of a major tournament for the first time, I am in no doubt that they will qualify next time, and I will be supporting them all the way!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended River Action’s parliamentary reception about the crisis our rivers are facing and the launch of its <a href="https://riveractionuk.com/charter-for-rivers/">Charter for Rivers</a> which sets out ten key actions needed to restore our rivers and fresh waters to health by 2030. River Action is a UK environmental charity committed to addressing the severe river pollution, particularly caused by agricultural and food industry practices, and sewage discharge by water companies, and has an Advisory Board with Lord Randall, Ben Goldsmith, Marina Gibson, and Jeremy Wade. The Charter has been endorsed by Wildlife and Countryside Link, The Rivers Trust, National Trust, British Rowing, Nature Friendly Farming, WWF, The Soil Association, and others. Recent River Action polling revealed that 94% of the British public support the need for healthy rivers by 2030, and almost 50% want it to be a top priority in political Party manifestos.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Business in the Chamber was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-03/debates/CF82F174-BC12-452A-B9B0-F67B7940CCCC/EconomicActivityOfPublicBodies(OverseasMatters)Bill">Second Reading of the Economic Act of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill</a>. The Labour Party tabled a Reasoned Amendment presented by Lisa Nandy, which was pushed to a vote, and was defeated by 272-212 votes. The Labour Party then decided to abstain on the Second Reading vote, which was carried by 268-70 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Environment APPG chaired by Shaun Spiers, executive director of Green Alliance, met to discuss Deep Sea Mining (DSM). The deep sea holds vast amounts of valuable metals and minerals used in technologies that will help power the green transition. But <a href="https://ejfoundation.org/reports/towards-the-abyss-deep-sea-mining">research suggests that DSM</a> could have devastating environmental impacts that remain poorly understood and many countries have called for a moratorium or precautionary pause. This new form of mineral exploitation which would likely become the largest mining operation in history were it to start, would significantly disturb the delicate environment of the deep sea, with devastating consequences for our ocean, wildlife, and the people who depend on it. The roundtable discussion explored the key questions concerning the relationship between the nascent DSM industry, the demand for raw materials for the green energy transition, ocean conservation, governance and the scope of the scientific understanding of the pristine habitats and ecosystems of the deep sea. Lara Shirra White, campaigner for Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) gave an overview of DSM. Dr Helen Scales, marine biologist, writer and broadcaster, provided an insight into the environmental aspect of DSM. Hannah Lily, ocean law expert, spoke about the realities of a moratorium and legal pathways to protect the ocean. Libby Peak, Head of resource policy, Green Alliance, addressed the links between DSM, the green transition, and how to resource the switch to renewable energy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pleasure to meet Baroness Anita Gale in the Lords to have our weekly catch up and share what is happening in the Commons, Lords, Neath and Wales. Anita was the first female General Secretary of Welsh Labour, and a role model for me and many other women in Welsh politics. Anita introduced all women short lists (AWS) in Wales so that women had an equal opportunity of being selected to become an MP or an MS, until parity was reached. I was honoured to be elected the 443rd female MP to Parliament and this was due to an AWS. Anita has been active in the Lords since her appointment in 1999 and has been the frontbench spokesperson for Wales and Equalities. The APPG for Parkinson’s will be holding a reception for Anita to celebrate 30 years of Anita chairing our APPG.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected a vice chair at the AGM of the APPG Hospitality, Events, Food and Drink Businesses. Civil servants from the Department for Business and Trade DBT gave us a presentation on the support that it offers to businesses who want to export for the first time, or want to expand the export part of their business. The DBT representatives also told us about their export champions initiative where businesses who have made a success of exporting their goods seek to network with businesses looking to export in order to explain all the processes and challenges, but also outline the support that the DBT can give to smooth the transition from expanding from the domestic market to dealing abroad. The DBT offers the UK Export Academy, Export Support Service, Export Champion programme, and its “Made in the UK, Sold to the World” campaign. It was so good to see Gemma Nesbitt who used to work In Regeneration and Economic Development for NPT Council, before becoming the Sector Lead DIT (replaced by the Department for Business and Trade) Wales, responsible for trade promotion, inward investment for food and drink, agriculture and agritech, life sciences and medtech. Further details contact <a href="mailto:parliament@trade.gov.uk">parliament@trade.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Phil Jones, chair of Regional and National LGBT+ at <a href="https://www.unitetheunion.org/">Unite the Union</a> to discuss equality issues in Neath and Wales, and the marvellous work that Unite are doing to represent LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities in Wales. Phil lives in Neath, and I have been proud to be one of his friends for 10 years. Phil and I will be meeting Jo Galzaka who is our mutual dearest friend and is the Welsh Regional Women’s and Equalities Officer for Unite, to make plans to continue with raising awareness of equality issues in Neath and Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was unlucky again not to be drawn on the Order Paper for <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-05/debates/7BFBB8C6-A571-4776-843A-4071FE2820E3/OralAnswersToQuestions">Wales Questions</a>, but I “bobbed”, and I was fortunate to be called by Mr Speaker. The Welsh Minister James Davies MP was assigned to answer my question, and I asked him as a GP he knows the value of community engagement, so would he ask the Home Secretary to increase investment in Policing in Wales to ensure an efficient response to tackle crime when bad things happen? The Minister told me that “the Hon Member is aware that there are more police officers in all the forces in Wales than ever before. The Government and the Home Office have been investing in the Uplift Programme and ensuring that there is a strong police presence across Wales.” I subsequently contacted Alun Michael (PCC for South Wales) to ask him to verify the Minister’s assertion because the published statistics for police officers is very difficult to interpret. Ministers, as did the Wales Minister, tend to talk about total numbers, but there are different ways of counting the number of officers in each force, and it is very challenging to derive the facts. Some officers are seconded to national, or other regional forces, some officers have been added through the Uplift Programme, some forces have failed to recruit the additional numbers they have been allocated through Uplift, and some forces have not been allocated the number of officers they lost through the cuts of officers due to the UK Government austerity policies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Alcohol Awareness Week 2023 event, coordinated by <a href="https://alcoholchange.org.uk/">Alcohol Change UK</a> and hosted by my friend Dan Carden MP. Each year over 5,000 public health teams, workplaces, GP surgeries, pharmacies, hospitals, charities, and community groups sign up to take part. The aim is to ensure people have increased knowledge around alcohol can make more informed choices about their drinking, seek support, and support those struggling. An Alcohol Change UK survey found that the average drinker spends nearly £62,900 on alcohol in a lifetime, 19% stated alcohol was an essential item, 9% prioritised alcohol over other items, 15% said in the last 6 months they were worried how much they’re drinking, citing socialising, and those drinking less (44%) said they did so for mental and physical reasons, and the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pleasure to meet Michael Rosen at the <a href="https://www.sla.org.uk/">Great School Libraries</a> event and talk about the joy of reading, and its ability to unlock words for children. Unfortunately, I didn’t read as a child, and have spent every day since making up for lost time. Michael Rosen is an author, poet, presenter, political columnist, and broadcaster. He has written 140 children’s books, served as Children’s Laureate from 2007-2009, and won the PEN Pinter Prize for his “fearless” body of work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the launch of the <a href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/the-impact-of-place-based-approaches-to-tackling-youth-unemployment-new-appg-for-youth-employment-report/">APPG for Youth Employment Inquiry Report</a> which looked at place-based approaches to tackling youth unemployment. It’s aims were to: understand challenges facing young people accessing education, training, and employment opportunities where they live; how place-based solutions are working; and what works. The inquiry heard oral evidence from 15 stakeholder organisations from local government, mayors, employers, charities, and young people, plus 18 pieces of written evidence. The key findings about place-based opportunities are: unfairness at a macro and micro level, in all communities; place plays an important role in access to a range of services and positive transitions to employment; interplay between economic and social deprivation and NEET rates; range of challenges including poor career advice, poor connectivity; and place-based approaches to work. Recommendations are that the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities should: recognise place-based approaches as key to tackling youth unemployment by including a commitment as one of the White Paper missions; review and evaluate the impact of Trailblazer devolution deals to identify best practice; establish a Youth Unemployment Task Force. The DWP should: have an expanded brief for NEETs, funding for local Jobcentres to outreach to young people; and build on Youth Hubs successes. The UK Government should set out a long-term strategy for youth employment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I dropped into the <a href="http://bduk-exec-office@dcms.gov.uk/">Building Digital UK</a> (BDUK) event and met the CE of BDUK Paul Norris who explained that this UK Government programme is aimed to deliver gigabit-capable broadband to UK premises in rural and hard to reach areas which are not covered by suppliers’ commercial rollout schemes. Mr Norris confirmed that Building Digital UK does cover households in Neath, and I look forward to a Wales specific event that he intends to hold in the autumn, so that I can learn more about the offers and delivery timescale for Neath constituents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the day of the 75th anniversary of the creation of the NHS, 5th July, I attended the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Aneurin-Bevan-Society/100070325373053/">Bevan Society Lecture</a>with guest speaker Professor Sir Michael Marmot, and a panel discussion featuring David Brindle, Sara Gorton, and Professor Laura Serrant OBE, on the future of the NHS. Professor Marmot is professor of epidemiology, University College London, and director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity. He is author of The Health Gap, and has led research groups on health inequalities for 50 years. He published The Marmot Review in February 2010; The Marmot Review:10 years on in February 2020; and Build Back Fairer: The Covid-19 Marmot Review. Professor Marmot’s first review found that the rate of increase of life expectancy slowed dramatically in 2010/11, which reversed a century long trend. The UK Government suggested that the UK had peaked for life expectancy, but comparisons with other countries disproved this. The greater the deprivation, the greater the inequities, and life expectancy for the poorest people living outside London is getting worse. If you’re rich it doesn’t matter where in the UK you live. Marmot says the UK Government was proud of its mission to cut public expenditure, but in cutting it in a highly regressive way, the poorer the community the greater the reduction. UK Government policy increased poverty and made inequality worse. David Brindle is a leading commentator on social care issues with more than 30 years’ experience of the sector as a journalist and non-executive. He joined the Guardian in 1988 and became Public Services Editor in 2020. He has won several awards and is currently chair of Ambient Support social care provider. Sara Gorton is Head of Health at Unison where she runs the union’s UK bargaining, influencing, and campaigning work for members in the health sector. She leads the joint NHS trade unions and interacts with UK Government, employers, and system leaders on industrial and workforce policy, and is currently co-chair of the NHS Staff Council, the England NHS Social Partnership Forum, and the Cavendish Coalition. Sara provided the trade union perspective on 75 years of the NHS. Professor Laura Serrant was the first of her family to attend university and one of the first to qualify as a nurse through a degree. She appeared in BBC4 Documentary Black Nurses: the women who saved the NHS, and after fulfilling many roles, in 2018 was appointed the first black woman to head a school of nursing at Manchester Metropolitan University. In October 2017 Laura wrote a poem “You called….and we came” to recognise and celebrate the contribution made by black nurses to the health system in England, and shone a light on the hardships, prejudice, and challenges faced by brave men and women like her parents who responded to the call from England to leave their Commonwealth Island and rebuild the motherland after WW2. She shared the poem with her musician son Rob Green and musical director Christella Latras, and it was set to haunting music and danced to by the Phoenix Dance Theatre. Laura read her very moving poem at the end of the event.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was delighted to attend the Age UK where I spoke with Rhian Morgan from <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/cymru/">Age Cymru</a> who told me about the well-being programmes that they are delivering across Wales, including: low impact functional training (LIFT); Nordic Walking; Tai Chi; Arts and Creativity; independent advocacy; dementia advocacy; and support for carers. Rhian invited me to visit Age Cymru office in Splott so that I could meet the staff and learn more about their superb work supporting older people who are facing some of the hardest challenges imaginable. Some live in poverty or can’t get the care they need. Loneliness is a daily struggle with only the radio or TV for company. Age Cymru’s vision is an age-friendly Wales where older people enjoy good health, live safely, free from discrimination, and active in their communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was in the Chamber to sit next to my friend Rachael Maskell when she presented her <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-11/debates/7435C28E-7F68-4747-BD9C-EDCA0824B2AD/BullyingAndRespectAtWork">10 minute Rule Bill</a> to provide a statutory definition of bullying at work; enable claims of workplace bullying to be considered by an Employment Tribunal; introduce a Respect at Work Code setting minimum standards for positive and respectful work environments; give powers to EHRC to investigate workplaces and organisations where there’s evidence of a culture of bullying; and powers to take enforcement actions. Rachael’s Bill will receive its Second Reading on 24th November 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism it was an honour to introduce a meeting on medicines labelling and ingredients. The aims of the meeting were: discuss the need for clear labelling of medical products which use animal derived ingredients and why this is important to the vegan and vegetarian community and those from faith groups and to discuss any action that could be taken to encourage the use of non-animal derived alternatives wherever possible. We held our first ever APPG event on 6th December 2016 and we heard from consultant gastroenterologist Dr Kinesh Patel on the potential to shape the regulation of medication and medical products after Brexit so they are suitable for vegans and vegetarians. We called on the Health Department to mandate labelling of medicines to indicate if derived from animals and switch to plant-based alternatives where viable in the long-term. But didn’t have a response. We held a follow-up meeting on 26th April 2022 after Brexit negotiations had concluded where we revisited the issues which hadn’t improved and wrote to the then Health Secretary Matt Hancock, but he did not respond. The distinguished and knowledgeable panel at the meeting were: Moussa Haddad, Head of Research and Policy at Vegetation for Life, who spoke about Veganism as a philosophical belief and the reasons why Vegans’ rights should be protected in medical settings; Evie Sier, a vegan patient who suffers from a heart condition which requires regular medication, but this is not available as an animal-free option; Yasmin Aktar, Community Organiser for British Islamic Medical Association, spoke about religious groups’ experiences of acquiring medication; Dr Ishani Rao, former Junior Doctor and trainee GP at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, who spoke about prescribing medicines in the community and the lack of knowledge and provision of animal-free medicines; and pharmacist Paul Fleming, Technical Director for the British Generic Manufacturers Association BGMA, who formally worked for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). There was agreement amongst the panellists that labelling of existing medicines was not clear enough for Vegetarians and Vegans to discern whether content is animal-free. Much of the detailed information is contained on a small print paper included inside the medicine box, is very difficult to decipher, and the animal content information is often at the very end of the paper. There is a need for a knowledgeable website which could provide accurate details of the contents of medicines, which could be easily accessed by Doctors, pharmacists, and the public. There are very few animal-free content medicines options available, and in life threatening situations, vegans and vegetarians have to choose between taking animal content medicines or dying, and Evie spoke very emotionally about this choice that she faces everyday of her life. She has had to forgo her belief in order to live. There is more research on animal-free medicines but pharmaceutical companies are not economically motivated to produce these, and the MHRA is slow to approve them. However, where the actual content of the medicine is animal free, but it is packed into gelatinous capsules, these could easily be replaced by pectin capsules at the same or less costs, which would remove the necessity for vegans and vegetarians to decant these gelatin capsule medicines, which may result in a lower dose being taken, due to the loss of some of the medicine during the decanting procedure. I raised the very concerning data released on 8th July by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Hampshire and Kent Scientific Services inspectors found that 24 of 61 food products (31%) marked as vegan that they tested contained traces of egg or dairy, including 13 dairy alternatives and 48 meat alternatives; some people confuse the vegan label with free-from allergens such as milk and eggs. The “vegan trademark” denotes products that are vegan as far as possible, which are strict but achievable standards for brands when they register to be awarded the vegan trademark to ensure customers can rely that efforts are made to avoid cross contamination within food services. But this is not guaranteeing free-from allergens because most factories produce non-vegan food and vegan food in the same place, and some cross contamination may take place, which is why some vegan products have “May Contain Milk” on them. But if vegan food had to be made in vegan factories this would drastically reduce provision, and a major problem is that there is no legal definition of vegan food. We hope to discuss these issues at the next APPG meeting in the autumn.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the AGM of the APPG for Compassion in Politics whose aim is to put compassion, inclusion, and co-operation at the heart of politics, to nominate my friend Debbie Abrahams be re-elected chair, and I was honoured to be elected as one of the vice-chairs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was the return of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-11/debates/5D96460C-A67B-4782-B74B-89BDD8ACE51A/IllegalMigrationBill">Illegal Migration Bill</a> from the Lords who had made 114 amendments with cross-Party support, of which 18 were pushed to a vote in the Commons. The UK Government instructed its Conservative MPs to disagree with all Lords Amendments, and won every vote, but 16 Conservative MPs rebelled on Lords Amendment 56. The rebellion was led by former PM Theresa May who spoke in favour of amendment 56, warning that if it is overthrown, “it will consign more people to slavery, no doubt about it”, but the UK Government still defeated the amendment by 285-243 votes, a majority of 42. The votes took nearly 4 hours. I supported all the Lords’ amendments. The Bill was sent back to the Lords so that they could give consideration to the disagreements in the Commons, which took most of the following day, and the Bill will return to the Commons in the near future because the UK Government has indicated that they want the Bill to become an Act before the summer recess begins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called in to the <a href="https://kinship.org.uk/">Kinship Care</a> event to support the #ValueOurLove campaign, and met Lorna, a kinship carer from Cardiff, whom I have had the privilege to meet before. The campaign is urging UK Government to give kinship carers a right to paid leave, like adoptive parents, not a P45.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met doctors from <a href="https://gbss.org.uk/">Group B Strep Support</a> which is the leading charity working to stop Strep B infection in babies. Strep B is the UK’s most common cause of life-threatening infection in newborn babies and of meningitis in children. Approximately 800 babies will develop Strep B every year, with 50 dying, and 70 recovering with life-changing disabilities, which is nearly double the rate of other high-income countries. There is an ongoing landmark clinical trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research named GBS3 is exploring whether routinely testing pregnant women for Strep B will prevent more infections than the UK’s current risk-based approach. GBS3 will involve 320,000 pregnant women, and cost £4.2 million, is run by Nottingham School of Medicine, has 71 sites signed up across England and Wales and will report its results in 2025. Testing-based strategy has been shown to reduce early onset group B Strep by up to 86% in countries which routinely test all pregnant women. Whereas since 2023 the UK has used a risk-factor prevention strategy looking at situations in which a pregnant woman has an increased risk of her baby developing GBS infection has risen by 19%.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a Deferred Division because when a procedure motion was presented to Mr Speaker ratifying the Parliament recess periods for the summer, the conference period, and Christmas 2023 under Standing Order 25 was challenged by an MP, who does not have to state the reason. Under Standing Order 41A, the Deferred Division takes place the day after the challenge is made, and MPs are handed out pink papers in the Division Lobby by clerks between 11.30-2.30pm. Each MP who chooses to vote ticks the Aye or Nae box. The clerks then collect the papers and tally the votes. The result was 395-5 in favour of the recess periods taking place on the dates published.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I held a <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1679454122859429888?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">celebration event for my Shark Fins Act</a> receiving its Royal Assent (on 29th June at 11.06am) when the Lords Speaker announced it in the Lords Chamber. My Act prohibits the import and export of detached shark fins and shark fin-containing products in Great Britain, with routes available for conservation related exemptions. It also extends an existing prohibition on shark finning in place for UK fishing vessels to all vessels operating in UK waters. I was very humbled by the number of people who dropped into the event to show their support. The Shark Conservation charities brought along lots of shark fun stuff. Alex from Shark Guardian brought some amazing shark suits, and some children’s books about the history and lives of sharks. Graham from Bite Back Shark and Marine Conservation brought the biggest banner I have ever seen with a picture of a full-size shark on it, and some luggage tags with fins on them. Ali Hood from The Shark Trust brought “The Big Shark Pledge” banner with important statistics about sharks on it. I shall be forever grateful to the Parliamentarians from all Parties who spoke in support of the Bill as it passed through the Second Reading, Committee Stage, and Third Reading in the Commons and the Lords, and most of them called in to have their celebration photos taken. There are too many to mention them all, so I’ll just give you a flavour of my wonderful day. Baroness Maggie Jones of Whitchurch took my Bill through the Lords. Maggie was having a very busy day, but she found some time to call in. Maggie was a pleasure to work with and ensured that my Bill had cross-Party support in the Lords. Maggie and I have become friends. Minister for Victims and Sentencing, Ed Argar MP and I have been friends since we worked together on my first Private Members’ Bill (PMB) to add mothers’ names and occupations on marriage certificates, because in 2015 this wasn’t possible, and hadn’t been since marriage certificates were created. Unfortunately, the UK Government didn’t support my PMB, but consequently introduced its own legislation for this provision. Ed had resigned from the UK Government when my Bill was at Second Reading, so was able to speak in support from the Conservative backbenches. It was timely because Ed was reappointed to the UK Government two weeks later. My friend Steve Double MP was the UK Government Minister who spoke from the frontbench at Second Reading, and I remember how surprised and thrilled I was when he said that his Government were supporting my Bill. Once the UK Government signalled its support, Conservative Whip Rebecca Harris MP, who is in charge of Friday Sittings for PMBs, was a key figure in coordinating support. Rebecca and I have become close friends, and I am indebted to her for her unwavering solidarity. My dear friends Matt and Matt the Doorkeepers, who have looked after me since I entered Parliament, were on duty on the Fridays that my Bill went through the Commons, and I was so pleased that they popped in to see me during their break from Chamber duty. Some people entered into the absolute joy of the occasion and dressed up in Alex’s shark costumes. My wonderful friend Tracey Crouch MP, former Minister for Sport, has been my fantastic friend since she discovered that I share her passion for sport. Tracey dressed up and really got into character by “jawing” everyone who called in. Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP and I served in the Shadow Cabinet together, and we are close friends. John brought his grandson with him, and he dared his grandson to dress up in a shark’s costume, which he did, and John took a photo which he said he would have great delight in circulating to his grandson’s friends! His grandson was really enjoying himself, and he told me I’d made his day. All enjoyed the Welsh Cakes I’d brought from Neath.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the first joint meeting for the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/">Parkinson’s</a>, <a href="https://crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/info-support/become-a-member?gclid=CjwKCAjwtuOlBhBREiwA7agf1rggAM2MuKE8ov2xWdYxSG38jNu_HSzIPTLmoZ6MJo_OiKFfNutXXRoC7sgQAvD_BwE">Crohn’s and Colitis</a>, and <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/">Multiple Sclerosis</a> (MS) APPGs. I am a vice-chair of the MS APPG, a member of the Crohn’s and Colitis APPG, and the secretary of the Parkinson’s APPG. The meeting discussed 10 Years of PIP, the reasons the criteria do not work for claimants, and suggestions for reforms of the system. Over 130,000 people in the UK have MS, about 145,000 live with Parkinson’s, and over 500,00 have Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis. The additional costs in living with these conditions include mobility aids and equipment; treatments; and care. PIP is meant to help manage these extra costs, but many symptoms of these conditions, such as pain, fatigue, incontinence, and cognitive issues, are hidden, and fluctuate from day to day, hour to hour. The present PIP system doesn’t enable people with hidden symptoms to fully explain how their conditions impact on them, and they are denied the help they desperately need. The meeting called on the UK Government to change the following criteria: the arbitrary 20 metre rule – which currently means that if a claimant can walk one metre over this arbitrary figure they can’t receive the highest rate of mobility support; “informal observations” – PIP assessors often make inaccurate decisions made on informal observations- 67% of MS claimants said this did not accurately reflect their situation, and 50% of Parkinson’s said the assessor did not have good knowledge of their condition; the 50% rule – which states that if your symptoms affect you for less than 50% of the month you are not eligible for support; and PIP descriptors should be overhauled to reflect reality.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to attend the event supporting people who use urinary catheters, which many do so as a result of conditions such as MS or spinal cord injuries, to live their lives to the fullest. I met representatives from the <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/">MS Society</a>, <a href="https://www.theurologyfoundation.org/">The Urology Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.spinal.co.uk/">Spinal Injuries Association</a>, <a href="https://www.coloplast.co.uk/">Coloplast UK</a>, and some wonderful people who use indwelling catheters. The objective of the campaign is to get people talking about the challenges and barriers faced by people who use catheters. Most people don’t like to talk about wee or toilet stuff which is still a taboo and embarrassing subject. Despite bladder problems being one of the easiest medical problems to solve, too many suffer in silence. There are over 90,000 people in the UK using indwelling catheters, and an estimated 90,000 use intermittent catheters. Optimal catheter care means the right care for an individual’s needs and provided with information and specialist support, which reduces the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), which occur when the bladder is not fully emptied and lead to discomfort and even hospitalisation. The estimated cost to the NHS is £99 million per annum for catheter associated UTIs. Patients need to be equipped with the correct knowledge and skills if they are to safely undertake intermittent self-catheterisation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1681982288798834688?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">UNISON 2023 Year of Black Workers event</a> to mark the 75th Anniversary of Windrush, celebrating the contributions of the Windrush Generation, and to reflect the work that still remains to be done for those fighting for justice. I pledged to support Patrick Vernon’s campaign to establish “Windrush Day” on 22nd June, which was the day that HMS Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in 1948, carrying over 800 African Caribbean people. Windrush Day will forever remember the contributions of Black Communities, many of whom came to the UK as immigrants. This historic moment has special meaning for UNISON because workers from the Commonwealth helped rebuild public services and transformed our trade unions. Some months ago, I was proud to be shown the UNISON exhibition in their Cardiff Office Building by my dear friend Steve Belcher. The amazing display sets out the history of the trade union, and I still remember how impressed I was with the depth of knowledge and the detail of every part of the story of UNISON, which covers every wall of the entire second floor of the building.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1681574597739843585?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">attend the APPG for NI Reception</a> with my long-time friend Lord Paul Murphy of Torfaen. Paul was very kind and introduced me to many of his Northern Ireland colleagues who had worked with him to secure the 1998 Peace Agreement. Paul is so well respected in Wales, Northern Ireland, and the UK for his measured and co-operative approach to all matters, but this was particularly important when he played such a crucial role in the negotiations between all parties to bring an end to “the Troubles” in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-17/debates/B90B7C1B-2318-4DB9-BB83-9FD25500C8A6/IllegalMigrationBill">main business in the Chamber</a> was the return from the Lords for the second time of the Illegal Migration Bill. Last week we voted to support the Lords in 18 of their Amendments, but the UK Government won every vote. The Bill went back to the Lords who voted to send 9 Amendments back to the Commons in another round of “ping-pong”. We supported all 9 Amendments, but the UK Government again won every vote, before sending the Bill back to the Lords. The UK Government are adamant that the abhorrent measures which include detention for accompanied and unaccompanied children; removal of LGBT people; modern slavery victims access to support; safe and legal routes; and the inadmissibility of migrants claims. The UK Government hasn’t made a single concession on this round of ping-pong, and it is determined that this Bill will become enshrined in law before Parliament breaks up for the summer recess. But this Bill will substantially increase the asylum backlog, putting tens of thousands of people in long-term hotels and asylum accommodation, costing billions. It won’t tackle criminal gangs nor deter boats, it will make it more difficult to get international return agreements, harder to prosecute traffickers, and will lock-up children, pregnant women, and torture victims.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a PCS retirement reception for its General Secretary, my friend Mark Serwotka, which I managed to pop into for five minutes between votes. Mark was born and brought up in Aberdare to a Polish father and a Welsh mother. He joined PCS on his first day in his first job as a Benefits Clerk in 1979, and became General Secretary of PCS in 2000. After suffering from some heart problems, Mark had a successful heart transplant in 2016. Mark was President of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 2019. I wish Mark a very happy retirement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was privileged to <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1681332794797031426?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">attend the Compassion in Politics APPG</a> to listen to anti-Apartheid activist Dr Mamphela Ramphele to discuss “Why the world needs compassion: Lessons from post-apartheid South Africa” chaired by my dear friend Debbie Abrahams whose partner fled the apartheid regime with his parents when he was 9 years of age. Mamphela is a medical doctor, former vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town, a friend and colleague of the late Nelson Mandela, co-president of the Club of Rome, co-founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, and chair of the Global Compassion Coalition. Mamphela was a partner of the late anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, with whom she had two children. As co-founder of the Black Consciousness Movement and founder of ReimagineSA, Mamphela played a crucial role in the campaign to overturn the apartheid regime in South Africa and has been central to the rebuilding of South Africa (SA) in the decades since. Mamphela spoke about the many occasions she had visited Nelson in prison, and since he was released, including just before he died. She said at the end Nelson was a sad old man because the work he had started to defeat apartheid when he was released from prison in February 1990 had not been taken forward. There is still demarcation in SA because all Africans’ minds are imprisoned. SA is not yet free because what is needed are three pillars – Respect, Fairness and Compassion. But it is a global problem in politics. The ANC has failed to build a platform to deliver because it rejected advice and help from outside experts, and because of jail and exile, don’t know what socio-economic system is needed in SA, so it’s not different from the apartheid system. Most young and older people can’t read or write, and 70% of youngsters are unemployed. GDP and well-being should be driving the SA economy but SA Government not listening. Mamphela also said that the ANC edited Steve Biko out of Nelson’s “Road to Freedom” book.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have been campaigning to <a href="https://bantrophyhunting.org/">ban Trophy Hunting</a> since I became an MP eight years ago. Henry Smith MP has a Private Members’ Bill which passed with all-party support at every stage through the Commons to ban the import and export of trophies, which have been cruelly hacked off defenceless animals that these “hunters” pay thousands of pounds to shoot and kill whilst on a shooting safari abroad. The Bill is now making its way through its stages in the Lords, and at its Second Reading received a very rough ride from Peers on the Tory benches who are members of the “shooting and hunting” brigade. The Bill will be entering its Committee Stage which will be taken in the Lords Chamber sometime in the autumn, and the rumour is that the Tory Lords will table many amendments which will in effect wreck the Bill because the UK Government will not allocate the time needed for all the amendments to be discussed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I dropped into the Visit Britain Delivering growth for the British Economy event to make sure that Visit Wales was playing a part in being promoted as a wonderful place to visit in the UK. The briefing from Visit Britain told us that tourism is a growing sector providing inward investment, jobs, and supporting SMEs in every nation and region. Tourism usually generates £127 billion and supports 3.1 million jobs every year in the UK. The Treasury saw £12 billion income from the visitor economy in 2019. Visit Britain/Visit England funded by £20.1 million (DCMS), Visit Britain – £7.1 million, Visit England – £18.73 million, from Cabinet Office. <a href="https://www.visitwales.com/">Visit Wales</a> is the devolved Welsh Government Tourism Organisation to promote tourism to and in Wales. Tourism is very important to the economy of Wales, and it generates £6.3 billion a year, supporting local businesses, jobs, and SMEs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected vice-chair at the AGM of the <a href="https://rjappg.co.uk/inquiryreport/">Restorative Justice (RJ) APPG</a>, and I look forward to working with chair Elliot Colburn MP, and the Restorative Justice Council to continue to raise awareness of the benefits of RJ. And to lobby the UK Government to adopt and fund RJ throughout all sectors of society.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was humbled to attend the funeral of Violet Poole in Margam Crematorium. Violet was a childhood and university friend of my brother James, who sadly passed away before Christmas. Violet was born and brought up in The Farmer’s Arms Public House in Cefn Cribbw, and my brother was born and brought up in The Walnut Tree Public House in the adjacent village of Kenfig Hill. James kept in touch with Violet over the many years they were friends, and Violet became my friend through my brother. Cllr Huw David from Cefn Cribbw introduced the funeral service. Violet’s granddaughter Anna sang Imagine (John Lennon) live. Violet’s daughters read out Violet’s words about her memories of the Farmer’s Arms, and Cefn; and the poem Stones by Alfred Kreymborg. We sang Calon Lan, and listened to Violet’s favourite “Redemption Song” by Bob Marley. Violet regularly telephoned me, wrote wonderful long letters, and mentored me in many ways when I became involved in politics at a young age. There were many people from all over the world at Violet’s funeral, because she reached out to so many people during her 93 years. I shall never forget her kindness and I shall miss our long chats.</p>

  <summary type="text">In Parliament this week, South Lakes MP Tim Farron urged ministers to give the green light to a satellite radiotherapy centre at the Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal.

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In Parliament this week, South Lakes MP Tim Farron urged ministers to give the green light to a satellite radiotherapy centre at the Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal.</p>
<p>During a debate in Westminster Hall, Tim cited research undertaken by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Radiotherapy, which Tim chairs, which showed that for every time a new satellite unit opens, there is at least 20% more demand than was expected.</p>
<p>Tim also mentioned shocking new stats which showed that 3.5 million people live in 'radiotherapy deserts', where cancer patients live more than a 45-minute journey away from the nearest radiotherapy treatment centre.</p>
<p>The national radiotherapy advisory group says that any trust that allows that to happen is guilty of bad practice.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament, Tim said: "<em>People in Kendal, Grange, Windermere, Kirkby Stephen, Appleby, Sedbergh, Ambleside, Coniston, Grasmere and the rest of our communities in rural Cumbria are facing not just longer journeys, but shorter lives. That is not acceptable.</em></p>
<p><em>"We are desperate for action in Westmorland. We are desperate to see our satellite radiotherapy unit delivered at the Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal. I ask the Minister to act personally now and look at our bid for a satellite unit.</em></p>
<p><em>"If he acts and instructs commissioners to get on with the business of commissioning, I promise that our community will raise at least £2 million to help him to make that case in a partnership bid. If he commits to helping people in Westmorland to have better treatment, shorter journeys and longer lives, I will be permanently, eternally grateful."</em></p>
<p>Responding, the Minister for Health and Secondary Care, Will Quince said: <em>"The honourable Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale has been campaigning on the issue for around a decade, or perhaps longer, and he has met several Ministers.</em></p>
<p><em>"I am yet to meet with the honourable gentleman, and I know he was due to meet my honourable Friend the Minister for Social Care, but I am happy to honour that meeting.</em></p>
<p><em>"He recently met his local hospital trust to discuss radiotherapy being part of the new hospital programme. Ultimately, that is a matter for commissioners, but we can certainly have that conversation when we meet and try to find a way forward."</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, welcomed Google to his constituency where they hosted a ‘Digital Garage’ which sought to support local businesses and individuals in improving their digital skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Google Digital Garage is a multi-million-pound investment in free digital skills training for adults in the UK. Over the last five years, the programme has trained over 800,000 small businesses and individuals, providing free digital skills training both in person and online.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Over 30 local businesses attended this free event which hosted a variety of workshops and talks. They focused on a wide range of digital skills from branding to social media to graphic design. The individuals in attendance were invited to put questions to Google’s Digital Coaches about how they might better utilise these digital skills to help grow their businesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps had previously invited Google to his constituency to host this event and was very pleased they could help level up the digital skills of the many fantastic local businesses in Welwyn Hatfield. He met both local businesses owners and residents who attended and talked to them about how they were going take their business to the next level thanks to the new skills they learnt from Google.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps commented:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was great to welcome Google for part of their Google Digital Garage tour. I was really pleased to see so many local businesses and residents attend to hear from Google’s fantastic Digital Garage trainers, and I enjoyed meeting a number of local businesses and residents, to hear about how they plan to use the skills learnt today, and to see first-hand the importance of improving digital skills”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rikesh Valand, Google Digital Garage trainer from Google, who helped facilitate the event, thanked Mr Shapps for attending&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was great to be joined by Grant Shapps MP in Welwyn Hatfield today for a Google Digital Garage. As ever, we as trainers love getting on the road and speaking to business owners and individuals across the country about their needs, and how the Digital Garage and Skills to Go training programmes can help them in their professional lives.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He continued:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thank you to Grant Shapps MP for joining us, to learn more about the programme and to support their constituents”.&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps thanked Google for putting on this fantastic event and looks forward to seeing local businesses make use of their new digital skills in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The signature is the formal confirmation of agreement for the UK to join the group, following substantial conclusion of negotiations earlier this year. The Government will now seek to ratify the agreement, which will include parliamentary scrutiny, whilst other CPTPP countries complete their own legislative processes.  </p>

<p>The signing comes as a new government report reveals one in every 100 UK workers was employed by a business headquartered in a CPTPP member nation in 2019, equating to over 400,000 jobs across the country.   </p>

<p>Membership of the trade group is expected to spark further investment in the UK by CPTPP countries, already worth £182 billion in 2021, by guaranteeing protections for investors.  </p>

<p><strong>Mr Dunne said: </strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Growing our economy relies on boosting trade across the globe, and tariff free access to some of the fastest growing markets in the world is a crucial step in driving forward UK sales to international consumers.  </p>

    <title>PRAISE FOR WEST DUNBARTONSHIRE COMMUNITY TRANSPORT VOLUNTEERS</title>

<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has praised the impact of a voluntary group in West Dunbartonshire helping to provide door-to-door transport for vulnerable residents.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064785753378">West Dunbartonshire Community Transport</a> (WDCT) was established in 2019 to help reduce social isolation by working with community groups, and improve health outcomes by helping people to health appointments.</p>



<p>The volunteer-led group runs a free Health Appointment Transport Scheme for residents across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven – helping people with essential journeys including GP and hospital visits.</p>



<p>The area’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes met with community transport volunteers during a visit in Dumbarton, and is supporting a recruitment drive for volunteer drivers.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“I have been really impressed by the work of the volunteers at West Dunbartonshire Community Transport (WDCT). They are providing a valuable service for residents who would otherwise find it challenging to travel for essential healthcare appointments.</p>



<p>“The free community transport initiative particularly benefits vulnerable people; helping to tackle social isolation and improve health outcomes.</p>



<p>“I was delighted to catch-up with the team at WDCT and hope to see them serving the communities of West Dunbartonshire for years to come.</p>



<p>“The charity’s community driver scheme is currently on the lookout for volunteers – I’d encourage anyone interested in volunteering to get in touch.”</p>



<p><em><strong>If you’d like to book transport with WDCT – or are interested in helping out as a volunteer driver – you can contact the charity by email on <a href="mailto:wdctag@gmail.com">wdctag@gmail.com</a> or call 07990 825 754.</strong></em></p>

<p>I started the week in Uxbridge supporting the efforts of Labour’s candidate Danny Beales in the by-election that is taking place next week.<br/>
It’s clear that the people in Uxbridge are annoyed and frustrated with what they see as an absentee MP and want an MP who will representative them to Parliament and be a real party of their community.</p>
<p>Listening to voters in Uxbridge, there were lots of overlaps with the issues I am contacted about by my constituents in Bristol South. From the Cost-of-Living Crisis, particularly rising mortgage and rent costs, food price rises and soaring energy bills to concerns about our health service and police numbers. Only a Labour Government can now give the country a fresh start and deal with the issues that ordinary people are facing every day.</p>
<p>In Parliament this week, I was pleased to speak on the importance of pharmacy services, the way they can help ease pressure on GPs and A&amp;Es and highlight the challenges that people are facing when trying to find a local pharmacist.</p>
<p>Across the country, those who rely on local, accessible pharmacies are finding it more and more difficult to access the services they need. Whether it is because of the closure of pharmacies on the high street or supply problems leading to situations where women are having to chase around to find the correct prescribed dose of hormone replacement therapy drugs, it is not good enough.<br/>
The repeated announcements from the Government’s plans to expand the role of community pharmacies have not been followed up with action and the needed updates to legislation that could help has not been brought forward.</p>
<p>The House of Commons keeps ending earlier than normal and there is plenty of time for MPs to consider the rule changes that could help pharmacies so there is no good reason for this problem to continue.</p>
<p>Continuing the focus of pharmacies, I was able to speak at the launch event for the Pharmaceuticals sponsored report on ‘Model of Pharmacy in Years 2025-2030’.</p>
<p>There has been some fantastic research from Sigma Plc and the University of Bath into the work that pharmacies can offer. I’m pleased that the Labour Party has committed to ensuring that community pharmacies will be a key part of our reforming agenda if we win the next election.</p>
<p>I met students from Bedminster Down, Merchants Academy and Bridge Learning Campus. The students visited London and Parliament as part of the South Bristol Youth programme to help young people find out about apprenticeships, higher education and high-quality employment. Unfortunately, the timetable meant I didn’t get to see the pupils from Ashton Park and St Bernadettes. These visits happen because of great work done by South Bristol Youth and Parliament’s Democratic Access tours and the students were great at quizzing me about my work and role and key issues for Bristol South. Top of the issue list being buses.</p>
<p>The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) met this week to talk to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to examine standards and the appointment processes in Government.<br/>
We also spoke to Darren Tierney, the Director General of the Propriety and Ethics Team.</p>
<p>There has been concern recently with appointments to the House of Lords after the former Prime Minister’s resignation honours list provoked controversy. It is unclear how many of his appointments will contribute to just and effective law-making and highlights the need to reform the House of Lords and bring much needed openness and transparency.</p>
<p>Today, I had a wonderful visit to Knowle DGE, a specialist academy for young people with additional educational needs. I am always pleased to see students thrive in an environment where their individual needs and challenges are understood. The staff are supportive and allow the learners to achieve their potential while meeting the demands of the national curriculum in areas such as speech and communication and emotional mental health.</p>
<p>The school is a caring and enthusiastic place with happy students.  I can only say “Thank you” for having me!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to another hectic weekend in the constituency – I’ll be visiting the Holy Nativity ‘Open Church’ event and the Wilmott Park Bowls Club. If you’re also going to be there, please come and say hi – I’d love a chat!</p>
<p>If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575.</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/07/14/weekly-round-up-14th-july/">Weekly Round-up :: 14th July</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>Isles MP says ferry booking windows could be on the horizon</title>

<p>Isles MP Angus MacNeil is encouraged that Transport Scotland are now actively exploring the feasibility of a pilot scheme to retain ferry deck capacity for short-notice travel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-attachment-id="4238" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/20160617_140243/" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/20160617_140243.jpg" data-orig-size="1648,927" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="20160617_140243" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/20160617_140243.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/20160617_140243.jpg?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/20160617_140243.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4238"/></figure>



<p>Mr MacNeil has been in contact with the Scottish Government calling for a staggered release of vehicle bookings which would improve access to ferries for all, including islands residents who need to travel at short notice.</p>



<p>Commenting on the response he received from the Transport Minister, Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased to hear that Calmac are working with Transport Scotland and island communities to investigate a pilot to hold back some vehicle deck capacity for short-notice travel.</p>



<p>“I have been suggesting that, regardless of where people come from, there be a staggered release of space on car decks. 70% in the beginning, then 20% the month before and the last 10% in the week before the sailing. This gives different types of travellers, regardless of where people live, the ability to make these bookings. It gives businesses and people who need to travel at short notice or attend hospital, the hope of being able to travel.”</p>



<p>As part of the Islands Connectivity Plan (ICP) alongside the wider Fair Fares Review, Transport Scotland will consider all issues raised around this proposal. Engagement and consultation will be central to the ICP and will provide the opportunity to ensure that the ferry policy addresses the needs of island residents, businesses, and communities.</p>

    <title>Statement on Boundary Changes and the Next General Election</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">Since being elected in 2015, it has been my absolute privilege to serve the diverse communities of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency. Therefore, today’s Boundary Commission announcement brings both personal sadness and a wider concern for our region.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The changes mean that at next year’s General Election, our region will only be represented by two constituencies, reduced from the current three, and that is bad news for us all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, the re-drawn boundaries mean that, regardless of the wishes of the voters at the ballot box, I will no longer represent some of the communities I hold dear in the next election.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While the plans to reduce representation without fully considering our region’s unique geography and distinct needs are disheartening, the Commission did see sense and made some changes from previous proposals. In that regard, I want to thank everyone who shared their views with the Boundary Commission.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our concerted campaigning means the communities of Culloden, Balloch, and Smithton have been returned to the Inverness constituency where they rightfully belong, and new constituency titles now rightly include other communities such as Skye, Nairn, and Strathspey.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to the opportunity to continue serving the City of Inverness, Aird &amp; Loch Ness and other neighbouring communities while establishing new friendships with the residents of Skye, Fort William and Wester Ross communities as I seek to represent their distinct needs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the challenges these changes bring, I remain dedicated to serving all our communities. Your voices and your needs are at the heart of my work and, together with my SNP colleagues, I will continue to strive for the very best outcomes for our communities.</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing with some information about upcoming events and other local matters.</p>
<h2>Local Fairs</h2>
<p>Firstly my apology for missing out the month for Ewell Village Fair in my last update. The Fair is on Saturday July 15th. Fingers crossed for a sunny day.</p>
<p>There is also an Eco Fair at St Martin’s Church in Epsom from 10am to 2pm on Saturday 1st July 2023. There will be a range of volunteer and Council stalls, children’s activities and food. I went last year and it is a good event, with a lot of good local initiatives, particularly on protecting nature.</p>
<h2>Ashtead Consultation – Proposal for All Weather Football Pitch</h2>
<p>There has been a lively debate in Ashtead about the proposal by the Football Club to build a new all weather pitch on the Ashtead recreation ground. Mole Valley Council is now consulting on whether to give this the go ahead, and residents have until 31st July to respond.</p>
<p>If you want to take part in the consultation, this is the link to do so.</p>

<p>Or you can email AshteadConsultation@molevalley.gov.uk</p>
<h2>Surrey Stands with Ukraine</h2>
<p>The Epsom based team supporting Ukraine has asked me to give you an update and reminder about what they are doing.<br/>
Surrey Stands with Ukraine (SSWU) is an Epsom based charity. 100% of money raised goes towards life-saving supplies for the people of Ukraine, as well as covering transport costs to get these items into the hands of the people who need it most.</p>
<p>They are currently prioritising the collection funds to purchase electric generators and asking for tinned food, particularly meat and fish, to be left at our Stand in the Ashley Centre. To date they have sent over 75 truck loads of aid direct to those in need in Ukraine.</p>
<p>There are more details of their work and how to support them here<br/>
<a class="x1fey0fg xmper1u x1edh9d7" href="https://surreystandswithukraine.org/">https://surreystandswithukraine.org/</a></p>
<h2>Solar Panels</h2>
<p>If you are looking to install solar panels on your home, Surrey has just reopened its programme which allows people to get a cheaper price by being part of a county wide scheme. Details are at <a class="x1fey0fg xmper1u x1edh9d7" href="www.solartogether.co.uk/surrey">www.solartogether.co.uk/surrey</a></p>
<h2>Lavender Theatre</h2>
<p>If you are a theatre goer, there is a new, temporary outdoor theatre operating in Epsom this summer. It is performing Annie Get Your Gun. Details are at <a class="x1fey0fg xmper1u x1edh9d7" href="https://lavendertheatre.com/">https://lavendertheatre.com/</a></p>
<h2>Defibrillator – Grant Scheme</h2>

If you want to apply please register here:<br/>
<a class="x1fey0fg xmper1u x1edh9d7" href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MIwnYaiRMUyMH-9N6Jc6HLfy1IJ_lPFFotCZIB4mEYlUQ1VUWU9ISjI4MjNTVzlPWFk1SDQ2SzhRSi4u">https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MIwnYaiRMUyMH-9N6Jc6HLfy1IJ_lPFFotCZIB4mEYlUQ1VUWU9ISjI4MjNTVzlPWFk1SDQ2SzhRSi4u</a></p>
<h2>Volunteer Vacancies</h2>
<p>Finally a number of local Charities are looking for new trustees at the moment.</p>

			<p>Oldham East and Saddleworth MP Debbie Abrahams marked World Wellbeing Week this week by calling for people’s wellbeing to be a key objective of Government, and not just economic growth.</p>
<p>The theme of 2023’s world wellbeing week is anxiety.</p>
<p>Before being elected as the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Ms Abrahams was a public health consultant focusing on health inequalities and Chair of an NHS Trust.</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams MP said:</p>
<p>“World Wellbeing Week is a chance for policymakers to reflect on the centrality of wellbeing in policy decision-making. For too long, policies have chased economic growth at all costs, without considering the importance of the wellbeing of people. Most importantly, we must focus on the equity of this wellbeing – being working 3 jobs while still being poor, cold and hungry will clearly not contribute to people’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>“This year’s theme is anxiety, which is particularly relevant given last week’s rise in interest rates. Constituents across Oldham East and Saddleworth have been in touch with me to express their anxiety about the impact of this on their household finances, and how for many this has increased their anxiety.</p>
<p>“The World Wellbeing Movement has set a challenge to Governments but also local authorities, businesses, schools and individuals to think ‘beyond GDP’ as a success measure, and to look at what gives us fulfilment and enjoyment – our relationships, our green spaces and so on. I hope you can join this movement to a greater enjoyment and fulfilment.”</p>

    <title>Nottingham castle reopens for all</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/06/26/nottingham-castle-reopens-for-all/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Labour is very pleased that the castle has re-opened today Monday 26th June. On Exec Board meeting we announced that the re-opening of the castle would take place in June and we are delivering on our promise.&lt;br&gt;We have announced a new general admission price of £12 per adult, allowing people to return as many times as they like for a year, along with free entry for up to three accompanied kids aged 15 and under. This is in response to the rising cost of living, which is a serious problem for many of our communities, and will ensure that all families in Nottingham can once again access the castle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are also proud to be opening the castle with an exhibition to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Windrush in cooperation with Museumand and the National Caribbean Heritage museum and to recognise the massive contribution of the Windrush generation and their descendants on our city’s society and economy.&lt;br&gt;Today the reopening of the castle, was marked by Robin Hood and a merry band of local schoolchildren storming the gates, reclaiming the castle for the Nottingham people. Lots of people benefited from a special £1 ticket for the opening day to make our popular heritage site to all.&lt;br&gt;The opening will include access to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the newly reinvigorated Brewhouse Yard that showcases life of Nottingham through the ages from the 1500s to 1900s,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;the launch of ‘70 Objeks &amp;amp; Tings,’ to celebrate Windrush, brought to one of the Museum’s temporary galleries by Museumand (The National Caribbean Heritage Museum)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;a series of artist commissions and interventions on display around the museum, by Jemisha Maadhavji and Tim Fowler.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A visitor centre and café at the entrance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Access to the Robin Hood and Rebellion Galleries&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use of the land train for the first time after a few years&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;a Hood’s Hideout adventure playground in the dry moat for children to enjoy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;access to the caves- Mortimers Hole and King David’s dungeon for £5 per person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will develop a programme of events, exhibitions, gallery talks and school visits, and offer the site for events such as weddings and corporate functions to ensure that the castle provides a wide range of activities for all to enjoy in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pavlos-Lo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pavlos-Lo-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3097"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cllr Kotsonis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The City Council’s Portfolio Holder for Leisure, Culture and Planning, Cllr Pavlos Kotsonis, said: “We are thrilled to reopen Nottingham Castle for the people of Nottingham and for visitors from beyond the city. The castle belongs to the city’s residents and to all our diverse communities and it gives me great joy to be delivering on the promise made for a June reopening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We worked hard to achieve this in such a short time and we are looking forward to seeing people reconnect with a site that is so important to local people and to the city. We feel sure that the reinvigorated offer available will encourage many people to come back time and time again, with the new ticket allowing people to pay £12 once and visit all year round!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>To save lives, the Government must set new targets to tackle the ‘silent disease’</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As many people die from preventable hip fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes, Judith Cummins MP has revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Tuesday in the House of Commons, Bradford South MP Judith Cummins called on the Government to step up its game on bone fracture prevention and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith has been vocal on the issue of Osteoporosis, which affects half of all women and a fifth of all men over 50. It is characterised by a loss of bone density, leaving people vulnerable to breaks and fractures. Because symptoms often aren’t noticed until a serious break, osteoporosis has been called the ‘silent disease’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raising the issue in Parliament, Judith highlighted the shocking reality of the condition:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Many of these will be serious hip fractures, and as many people will die from these fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questioning the Minister, Judith asked why such a serious condition is so often overlooked in healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Can the Minister explain why not even one of the 63 key performance indicators set by NHS England for Integrated Care Boards sets a target for fracture prevention?’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Maria Caulfield MP, Minister for Women’s Health Strategy, thanked Judith for her longstanding work on bone health. The Minister also highlighted measures the Government is undertaking to tackle Osteoporosis:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘NHS England is expanding fracture services for higher risk women who do have Osteoporosis to prevent falls in the first place.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the Government’s claims to be stepping up fracture services, the limits of the current services mean that 74,000 preventable fractures will occur over the next five years, costing the NHS £665 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making fracture prevention a key performance target could lead to stronger delivery of these services, preventing unnecessary pain, giving patients the level of care they deserve, and saving vital NHS resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the exchange, Judith said that Government support for fracture prevention was still inadequate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Whilst Bradford offers a trailblazing service for those with Osteoporosis, this is not always the case nationally.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘The argument for investing in the prevention of fractures is clear: To save money and save lives, we need a government with the sense to invest in the future of women’s health in this country.’&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="636" height="791" src="https://nigelmillsmp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3375" srcset="https://nigelmillsmp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.jpeg 636w, https://nigelmillsmp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-241x300.jpeg 241w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></figure>



<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684233937.JPG" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684234142.jpg" alt=""/></figure>

    <title>Matt Warman MP welcomes school debaters to Downing Street</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2023/03/29/matt-warman-mp-welcomes-school-debaters-to-downing-street/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-4189 aligncenter" srcset="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png 300w, https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the visit &lt;strong&gt;Matt Warman MP commented&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith&lt;/strong&gt; who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you.

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was deeply concerned to read the decision taken by the Court in this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63313556">case</a>.</p>
<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p></div>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">Compensation package for Waspi women</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="213" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Labour has pledged compensation packages for millions of women hit by state pension age rises imposed by the Tories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a historic debt of honour to them.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
