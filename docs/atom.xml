      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is not the Happy New Year we were hoping for.

    <title>Vaccinations</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/01/06/vaccinations/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today I expect Parliament to want more detail on how we get out of lockdown. The Regulations imply another quarter of badly disrupted jobs and businesses, with no early let up in controls. What would be the trigger to allow some relaxation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; As the NHS experts see vaccines as the ultimate way out, there will be active debate on how the vaccinations can be speeded up. Presumably if enough people can be protected the government’s experts would then consider allowing more social contact and economic activity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would be helpful to know how much vaccine of the approved types is available on delivery schedules, and to be offered reassurance about who is going to administer the doses. Will the NHS seek the help of pharmacies as with annual flu vaccines? Will the NHS speed up accepting the volunteers with medical training who are willing to cone back to work and would help inoculate  people? Will others be trained to carry out the work? Will all GP surgeries and hospitals be offering  the  service and have supplies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sooner we can get back to saving jobs the better. Another national lock down has a big economic price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the experts now seem to think getting the first jab into people gives a decent  level of protection. This will speed up the process if they adopt that approach, which will require clarity for those receiving the vaccine over whether to expect a second dose and if so at what interval. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>“It is vitally important that we follow lockdown rules to stop the spread of this virus” – Karin Smyth MP</title>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“It is vitally important that we follow lockdown rules to stop the spread of this virus” – Karin Smyth MP</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Local MP, Karin Smyth, is encouraging all constituents to follow the rules laid down by the Government this week in order to protect those vulnerable to this virus and to support the work of NHS staff. This comes after the UK Government finally acted upon the SAGE documents published before Christmas.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Government has now implemented a national lockdown in England, and everyone must now stay at home to try to slow the spread of the virus; that means, working from home where possible and only go out for essential reasons: to shop for basic necessities, to exercise, to seek or provide medical assistance, and to attend education for those eligible. Most children and university students will now learn remotely until February half term.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For greater detail on the rules and exceptions, check the UK Government website at: <a href="http://gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609947550551000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLiV7obsfUO_K8WoTzkvmzXLrfJQ">gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Karin Smyth MP said:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“2020 was an incredibly difficult year for many and this was not the start we wanted to the New Year, but the third lockdown announced this week is vital to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to protect those most at risk from this virus. It’s important that we all act quickly on Government advice as we need to make up for time lost through dither and delay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The vaccine is being rolled out, but until sufficient numbers have been vaccinated, we need to continue to pull together and protect our family and friends, and all those we come into contact with. I know it’s difficult, that we all miss seeing those we love, and that we are weary of the frequently changing rules, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, and we must not stop now.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Support for constituents can be found on the Bristol Council website at <a href="https://www.bristol.gov.uk/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bristol.gov.uk/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609947550551000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnuP4YCjbRT0MAvCOYX50KuJjtJw">https://www.bristol.gov.uk/coronavirus/what-you-need-to-know</a> and from the local Citizens Advice Bureau at <a href="http://bristolcab.org.uk/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bristolcab.org.uk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1609947550551000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKa93gq4aVSLQZwsamnHRlO8xtHQ">bristolcab.org.uk</a> or on the phone at 0808 278 7957.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Last week MPs in parliament finally voted to approve a Brexit deal. Jon Cruddas MP, who was elected in 2017 and 2019 on a mandate to respect the outcome of the referendum, voted in favour of the deal. His full statement can be found below.</p>
              <p>
                <em>We were told that getting a trade deal with the EU would be easy. The deal we have been presented with is desperately thin and there are massive gaps and failures. 80% of our economy is now based on services and yet financial services don’t feature. The negative reaction of Britain’s fishing fleet and industry shows that we have not taken control of our waters as promised. Whilst it is a relief that our trade with the countries of the EU will not face tariffs nor quotas, there will be extra costs and bureaucracy imposed on businesses, so frictionless trade it is not.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Let there be no misunderstanding, this deal with all its shortcomings belongs to this Prime Minister and his Government. I will continue to stand up for local people and businesses and draw attention to the deficiencies of this agreement and the harm done.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>But the choice before Parliament was a simple, if a very unappealing one; to vote for a thin and inadequate deal or vote no deal which would be disastrous for our economy, local businesses and jobs. So I voted for the deal.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Having a deal with our largest trading partners means that in the future a Labour Government will build upon the current arrangements to strengthen environmental protection, improve consumer standards and extend the rights of workers.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Over these last terrible months when so many families have endured losses we have seen some of the best of Britain with our vital health and care workers, the workers that have kept society going and the inspiring efforts of so many people who have come forward to volunteer across Dagenham and Rainham. I am in no doubt that we can build a strong future for Britain outside the EU but that will require a competent Government that properly recognises and rewards those people who will bring about that brighter future.</em>

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-27/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituents</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update on the coronavirus pandemic. You will be aware that the Prime Minister last night announced a further lockdown across England.</p>
<p>The main thing that is changing for us locally is that schools are to close for all except the children of key workers. In addition, shielding is to be reintroduced for the most vulnerable. Most other rules, and particularly for local businesses, remain unchanged from what they were under the Tier 4 regime.</p>
<p>All the details about school, colleges and university closures can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#going-to-school-college-and-university"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Surrey Covid-19 Cases</strong></h3>
<p>The new measures have been prompted by a continued increase in the rate of infections locally and around the country and continuing increases in pressure on hospitals. The number of patients with the virus in Epsom and St Helier Hospitals continues to rise sharply.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/249378/Daily-Dashboard_0501.pdf"><strong>Here</strong></a> are the latest infection figures that I have for Surrey. You will see just how much of an increase there has been.</p>
<h3><strong>Business Support</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you in business who have been affected by the requirement to close, the Government has this morning announced additional grant support.</p>
<p>The first details of these are <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/46-billion-in-new-lockdown-grants-to-support-businesses-and-protect-jobs">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>These are in addition to the previous grants announced before Christmas.</p>
<h3><strong>Vaccination Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Many of you have sent me further questions about the vaccination programme.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.royalfree.nhs.uk/Patient_resources/COVID-19/(External_leaflet)_PHE_11843_Covid-19_why_do_I_have_to_wait_leaflet_download.pdf">Here</a> </strong>is the official NHS leaflet about the programme. I hope it answers many of your questions.</p>
<p>I know that the local NHS is ready to administer vaccines as soon as each delivery arrives in our area.</p>
<h3><strong>Shielding</strong></h3>
<p>With the return of shielding and the lockdown, if you have any difficulties getting access to support or to get essential things like food shopping done, please contact me and I will point you to where you can get help.</p>
<p>I will give you any more information as I get it.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

    <title>The UK’s future relationship with the EU</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/the-uks-future-relationship-with-the-eu/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p class="xmsonormal">On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister heralded the deal his negotiators had struck with European Union counterparts concerning our future relationship with our nearest neighbours and the largest trading bloc in the world. After running a General Election over a year ago to ‘Get Brexit Done’ and boasting he had an ‘oven-ready deal’, he seemed incapable of delivering this ‘gas mark 4, 20 minutes’ deal for the country until the last possible moment. Why is that?</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Well some, including the Government, have blamed the European Union. But I believe, this is all about the Government playing politics. It was clear where they were heading several weeks ago, and I predicted that just before Christmas, the Prime Minister would strike a deal and claim to have saved the day.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The theatrics, posturing and even the insincerity in how some politicians and their acolytes chose to behave is, for me, the worst aspect of what should be a noble profession. Instead this disingenuous, calculated game-playing demeans the role of MPs, and certainly discredits the title of honourable, let alone right honourable, members.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The fact that the Prime Minister had already signed the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement before the EU (Future Relationship) Bill had been voted on by MPs, makes an absolute mockery of Brexit being about taking back control and Parliamentary sovereignty. It is an appalling charade.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">But what about the Agreement itself? I think describing this deal as ‘thin’ is being kind to say the least. It is true it is better than no deal but there are many omissions, for example, on financial services which accounts for 80% of the UK economy, and there are many shortfalls, not least the aspect of the deal on fisheries.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The Agreement consists of three pillars: a trade agreement, collaboration on security and governance arrangements. The trade agreement provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods as long as UK goods have the same standards as the EU; however, that does not mean there are no costs to businesses.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">There will be costs associated with SPS checks, customs formalities and in establishing the rules of origin of UK goods. As mentioned above there is no financial services passport and professional qualifications from the UK will not be recognised. And although we no longer have access to most EU programmes, our experience this year with managing the Covid pandemic has made some in the Government realise the importance of co-operation with EU countries in life sciences research; as such the deal retains participation in Horizon Europe for the next few years, subject to the UK’s financial contribution.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">There are new security arrangements with the EU as we lose access to the European Arrest Warrant, but these are subject to the retention and implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights. And where either the UK or EU disagree with the interpretation or implementation of this new Agreement a soon-to-be-established (at what costs one wonders) Joint Partnership Council will seek to pass judgement on the dispute.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">But fear not! Our post-Covid holiday plans to Europe won’t be affected. We will be able to travel to EU countries for up to 90 days without a visa, but unfortunately our pets won’t. And there’s no protection from mobile phone roaming charges being re-introduced.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The reciprocal rights of EU and UK citizens, and peace and stability on the island of Ireland are still protected under the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland within this.</p>
<p><span style="color: black;">The new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement took effect on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2021. And as the European Commission states:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt;"><em><span style="color: black;">‘On that date, the UK will leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union, as well as all EU policies and international agreements. The free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the UK and the EU will end.</span></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.0pt;"><em><span style="color: black;">The EU and the UK will form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist today.’</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">It is difficult to do justice to the tens of thousands of pages that have been written about Brexit and what will happen now in a few hundred words. This deal is the result of what most British people said they voted for back in 2016, and what many people told me that they wanted last year when I campaigned during the General Election. I hope they’re right. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">But I fear that there will be many detrimental impacts resulting from this appalling deal, some of which may not emerge for months or even years. I hope I am wrong. So, I am putting you on notice, Mr Johnson, I will hold you to account for every empty promise that you have made, for the inequality that you say you can now vanquish and the ‘levelling up’ across our country that you claim can only now happen. I’m not going to let you get away with any more lies.   </span></p>

Last night the House of Commons voted by a decisive majority to support that deal. Four and a half years on from the biggest democratic exercise in our country’s history we now have a deal that takes back control, while maintaining a friendly relationship based on free trade with our nearest friends and neighbours. This delivers on all the manifesto commitments on which the Conservative Party was re-elected in 2019 and on my long-standing ambition to ensure we secured a deal with the European Union based on full restoration of U.K. sovereignty and free trade.</p>
<p>I always believed that a full and fair referendum on EU membership was the only right thing to do as I saw our relationship with our neighbours changed and like many people felt that too many decisions were being taken over the heads of the British electorate. I campaigned for a referendum even before it was my party’s policy, I campaigned for reform of that relationship and although I campaigned to remain during the Brexit referendum campaign as I believed that remaining was the right pragmatic choice to make at that time, I always respected the fact that the electorate would decide.  When the British people spoke and people in Worcester voted decisively to leave the EU I immediately accepted  that it was incumbent on the government to deliver on the will of the British people.</p>
<p>After the referendum I was appointed one of the first Ministers in the Department for Exiting the European Union and over two and half years in that department, as it’s longest serving Minister I worked to secure the Withdrawal Agreement including the protection of rights for four million U.K. and EU citizens living in each other’s territories, the transition period and to set up our approach to the future relationship negotiations. There I set out the preferred future partnership of a relationship with a strong security partnership, an economic deal without tariffs on all goods and services; reduction of trade barriers without being bound by European rules; personal data protections; and associate membership of the Horizon programme so that our academic institutions can continue to work together to ensure we’re at the cutting edge of science and technology. All of these ambitions are achieved by the deal on which the House of Commons voted yesterday. Also at DExEU I prioritised protecting our citizens in Gibraltar by enabling them to have visa-free access to the Spanish mainland. Gibraltarians will have full access to the Schengen free travel area, protecting both their sovereignty and their ability to trade and travel.</p>
<p>The deal we have reached is a good deal for the United Kingdom and one that I am proud to have voted for. There will be no tariffs or quotas, meaning that many businesses will be able to continue to trade within Europe without extra baggage or cost and that British consumers will be protected from the negative impact of tariffs.   Security cooperation can continue in a way that benefits the safety and security of our people and there will continue to be a basis for the free exchange of data between the U.K. and the EU as well as recognition for our world leading standards for food and farming. Northern Ireland’s place in the U.K. customers territory and our internal market is protected but so is the absence of a border with the Republic of Ireland which has proved so important to the working of the Good Friday Agreement and the Peace Process.</p>
<p>A truly sovereign British Parliament will regain full control of British law, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. As promised we will continue to maintain the highest labour, environmental and climate standards. But we will do so because it is the right thing to do and it will be our elected MPs who set and are held accountable for these rules.</p>
<p>Fish featured heavily in the Brexit negotiations and I’m glad that this deal will take back control of our waters. Fishing communities will benefit from a boost of £100 million to expand and update their fleet of vessels. A five year period will help ease the transition, after which we will have full control of our waters. Crucially we continue to be able to export fish tariff free to our biggest market in Europe but our fisherman shall immediately begin to see the benefits of an increased share of catch.</p>
<p>In leaving the European Union and bringing and end to the transition period we are delivering on a solemn promise made to the British people, one which was reconfirmed in both the 2017 and 2019 elections. In December 2019 I was re-elected to represent Worcester with an increased majority and over 50 per cent of the vote after promising to get Brexit done. Within weeks we had passed the Withdrawal Agreement and now, one year later, we have a trade deal that will allow us to show what Global Britain means to the world. We can strike our own trade deals and set our own laws. We have control over our borders and our waters and we can thrive as an independent nation.</p>
<p>The people of Worcester 54:46 in favour of voting to leave the EU and this deal delivers on that outcome. Respecting the fact that the majority voted to leave but also that a significant minority wanted to protect our trading relationship with European neighbours. It protects the interests of businesses and consumers by ensuring no quotas or tariffs are introduced that would hinder trade with the EU.</p>
<p>This deal allows us to close this particular chapter and get on with the priority of British people which is combatting Covid, getting the country back to some kind of normality and then building back better and levelling up our economy. With this deal marking the largest and most comprehensive trade deal ever reached by the European Union it shows that we can get off to a new start as friendly neighbours and with over 60 other trade deals already signed this year it is a great jumping off point for our ambitions for Global Britain. I hope that after so many debates and arguments over the last few years this deal settles the issue of our departure from the EU and avoids the unacceptable extremes of either reversing the referendum result or leaving on bad terms and in dispute with our neighbours. Now is a time for the whole country to come together and make a success of our new position and it is time to look to the future with confidence.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting on the passing of the UK-EU future relationship deal, Andrew Gwynne MP said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We left the European Union formally back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in January and now the 11 month transition period ends at midnight tomorrow which means all our previous EU benefits and obligations terminate. That process cannot be stopped, it’s automatic as a result of the Article 50 provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So Parliament had a binary choice: a trade and security deal agreed between the UK and EU or us trading on WTO terms, which Labour has always said it would seek to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s lots more that could and should have been negotiated in this deal, and while it gives us tariff-free trade, there will still be new burdens like customs checks. It isn’t perfect. It does also provide a platform for security co-operation across the continent which is so important in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, which is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However thin, this deal is a million times better than no deal, and at this late stage it had to be approved ahead of the transition period ending tomorrow.  Hopefully now our country can heal, come together and face the future &amp;#8211; whatever it may bring &amp;#8211; united for the first time in four years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Losses due to UK Government induced panic must be repaired, says Isles MP</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has written to Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, urging him to repair the losses faced by the shellfish and fish operators in the Hebrides due to UK Government induced panic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “There will be many losses suffered by operators, shellfish producers and shellfish sellers who can ill-afford this. This is particularly felt in the Christmas market which is often a make or break market for companies. To have that snatched away from them at the last minute because of UK Government induced panic is doubly sickening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The UK Government caused the population of London to flee, caused the French to close the border.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The UK Government has been printing money left right and centre for bankers and handing out contracts worth billions to their friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They must not walk away from the problems they have created for fishermen, fish producers and fish processors here in the islands and the West Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I have therefore written to the Chancellor to make good any losses sustained to shellfish and fish operators in the Hebrides and west coast of Scotland. Our communities, which are going to be the hardest hit in all of Europe by the coming Brexit, can ill afford this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christmas cheer for the Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/christmas-cheer-for-the-friends-of-neath-abbey-iron-company/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Hard-working volunteers with the Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company have pulled another iron from the fund-raising fire – a £9,300 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to take the project to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Part of the cash will be used to create a digital guide to the history of Neath Abbey – including not only the world-famous ironworks but the impressive remains of the Cistercian monastery close by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;And with open days, guided tours and personal presentations all off-limits while the corona virus pandemic continues, digital outreach has become an essential tool in raising awareness of the project by allowing people to visualise the ironworks at its world-beating peak – when it powered the industrial revolution of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Data will be posted on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and People’s Collection Wales, creating a virtual guided tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;In addition, new interpretive panels at the ironworks will explain the history and function of the various structures and buildings on site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;The remainder of the money will be used to renovate an old BT telephone kiosk – which cost £1 – and convert it into a heritage centre at the nearby Longford housing estate where local people can, via a display book and works of art, discover the area’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;The artworks will be created by children of the local Dwr y Felin Comprehensive School. Other community groups such as Bryncoch Environment Group, Dyffryn Clydach Community Council, Dyffryn Clydach and Bryncoch Historic Group will also display community news, events and information in the kiosk.&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2344"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2344" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8DCDF1DF-42F0-4CD0-97E0-3676E4E7186B-560x297.png" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this challenging year draws to a close, our&amp;nbsp;thoughts and prayers are with the families who have lost someone to Covid, while those of us lucky enough to be untouched by such tragedy, will hopefully be thinking of our own families with fondness and thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We owe so much to our NHS and care staff but also to all the key workers who have kept us safe, maintained food or energy supplies, kept us informed and connected, and kept our schools and other critical public services functioning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the start of the vaccination programme, we can see light at the end of the tunnel, but this&amp;nbsp;winter will still be challenging, so let’s all continue to play our part by following the rules to keep each other safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it will be different for everyone this year, whatever your plans are, I wish you and your family a Peaceful Christmas and a Happy and Healthy New Year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take care,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Philippa&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color"&gt;To ensure we all minimise the risk of transmission and keep the virus suppressed,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;remember the FACTS for a safer Scotland:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate entitled &lt;strong&gt;Future of fairs and Showgrounds&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted to support those showmen and women here in South Shields which has a long history of welcoming traveling showmen and women that dates back almost 100 years. It is imperative that the Government stops ignoring the fairground and showmen community and steps in to provide vital support before it is too late. As a longstanding supporter and advocate for show people and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fairs and Showgrounds, I will continue to be a voice for this community and press the Government at every opportunity for better support and recognition. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the pandemic, many fairs were either cancelled or postponed – from summer fetes to Christmas Markets. As a result of the closures and postponing of fairs, many show people suffered huge financial loss, plunging them into financial insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The heart of the issue is that the financial support offered to the tourism industry during COVID-19 continually excluded the fairground community. Showmen and women also did not qualify for the assistance announced in the recent budget for retail, leisure and hospitality firms relating to business rates in the coming year, due to the way that the Show people operate, which falls outside the scope of static leisure providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Show people across the UK and particularly those here in South Shields, now face losing their businesses and livelihoods if the UK Government does not step in.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP John Penrose has welcomed news the Government will drop proposals to increase North Somerset’s housebuilding targets from 1,365 to 1,708 a year.</p>



<p>This announcement comes just months after John wrote to Ministers raising concerns that the proposed new housebuilding targets were unrealistic and weeks after John and Liam Fox raised the issue in a debate on housebuilding in North Somerset. John made the point that the algorithm being used&nbsp;encouraged environmentally damaging housebuilding over green fields rather than investment and regeneration in urban areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John said: &#8220;It&#8217;s great that the Government has listened to what I, Liam Fox, North Somerset Council and others have been saying. This is a big step in the right direction, although the existing building targets are still pretty high. But if we Build Up Not Out in urban areas like central Weston or Bristol, and use local Council-approved Design Codes so the new builds match the best of what’s already here, we can build a lot more green, good-looking homes that local people can afford, that are close to work, transport-links, shops, schools and GP surgeries, and which revive our town centres and High Streets too.&#8221;</p>

<p>2020 has left us with many legacies as we’ve coped with a set of circumstances none of us would have imagined. As we look to the light provided by new vaccines and as we approach a new year, there is yet another nasty legacy sting in the tail of 2020 – a rise in feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p>Research from Age UK has shown that this Christmas is set to be the loneliest yet for older people. Over 160,000 people over the age of 65 will suffer from feeling lonely this festive season, with nearly 60% of them fearing that they won’t see any family and friends. Those are heartbreaking numbers, even one person feeling like this is one too many.</p>
<p>Our communities can carry another more positive legacy from 2020. The Age UK research also highlighted that over 100,000 older people were helped to get through the pandemic by the kindness of strangers. The simple act of checking on people made a life-enhancing difference for so many, we can never know for sure, but it’s probably safe to assume that in some instances, it was life-saving.</p>
<p>Of course, loneliness and isolation don’t discriminate; young people are also affected. The Office of National statistics were able to point out that, during the first month of the pandemic, 7. 4 million people, across the nations of the UK said that their wellbeing was affected through feeling isolated.</p>
<p>We all knew that these restrictions were essential to protect lives, but the collateral effect was, as predicted, substantial. Recently, we have become more aware of a problem that has existed for some time but rarely brought into public debate. Work undertaken for the charities MIND and Mental Health UK confirmed that young people are particularly affected by loneliness.</p>
<p>During the pandemic almost half of 18-24-year-olds experienced, and those aged 25-34 are twice – yes twice – as likely to be lonely at Christmas than older people. That’s a lot of lonely people out there feeling isolated.</p>
<p>While we cannot visit indoors, there are many other ways we can help people feel less isolated. Given that a third of people are too embarrassed to admit that they are lonely, it is small acts that make a difference; it might be a note through the door or a phone call to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. Simple offers of contact, help with shopping, a chat a few steps back from the doorstep could mean a big deal to reassure folk that they are valued and to feel a little less alone.</p>

    <title>West Mercia Police to receive an additional £13m next year</title>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Mercia Police to receive an additional £13m next year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Mercia Police is set to receive an additional £13m in its funding next year, thanks to the Government’s increase to police budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced policing will receive up to £15.8 billion in 2021-22 – an increase of £636 million on last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes over £400 million to recruit 20,000 extra police officers by 2023, delivering on the promise made by the Conservatives in last year’s General Election. West Mercia has already benefited from an additional 105 officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding will be also be used to bolster counter-terrorism policing, including money for armed policing and more officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conservative Government has been determined to support the police throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as officers have worked tirelessly to keep communities safe. The Government has provided £30 million to help forces step up coronavirus enforcement and has reimbursed forces for all additional PPE purchased between March and July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Dunne said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Officers and staff at West Mercia have been instrumental in keeping our community safe this year, and I pay tribute to them for their hard work and professionalism, particularly in this challenging year. I have engaged with Police leaders here in Shropshire throughout the pandemic, and commend local officers for the way in which they have applied their tact and good judgment to keep our community safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to see West Mercia getting an additional £13m next year. I know the presence of additional officers on our streets has already helped reassure local residents. I look forward to speaking to our Police &amp; Crime Commissioner, John Campion, to learn how he intends to deploy the extra resource in South Shropshire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

<p>The MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, has welcomed that Holderness Health in his constituency is one of the first GP practices to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination against Covid-19 to their most vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>The UK became the first country in the world to approve the vaccine on 2nd December, when the independent Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency gave it the go-ahead. The NHS is now in the process of delivering the largest programme of immunisation in the country’s history, and subsequently announced that Castle Hill Hospital would act as a vaccine hub to protect the most vulnerable patients and healthcare staff in the region.</p>
<p>Now, GP practices are being added to the list of sites approved to administer the vaccine, despite health bosses having to contend with the practicalities of storing and transporting the vaccine, which must be stored between -80°C and -60°C and given to patients within six hours of being thawed.</p>
<p>As a result, Holderness Health has been chosen as one of four local Covid-19 vaccination centres in Hull and the East Riding, with more practices joining on a phased basis over the course of the coming months. The first GP-led vaccinations were carried out at Holderness Health yesterday afternoon (14th December).</p>
<p>Patients over the age of 80 with the greatest clinical risk are being offered appointments first, with priority groups determined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination &amp; Immunisation. Eventually, mass vaccinations will be offered in sports venues and conference centres once further vaccine supplies become available.</p>
<p>Graham commented, “This is fantastic news for vulnerable constituents in Beverley and Holderness, who will be among the first to be offered this vaccination by their family GPs.</p>
<p>“I know Holderness Health have plenty of experience in delivering safe and effective vaccination programmes, as they do every year with the flu jab, so I have every confidence that they will rise to the challenge despite its scale and complexity.</p>
<p>“The public can really help with this by not contacting the surgery to ask for a jab, because eligible people will be proactively contacted by phone, letter, or the national booking system.”</p>
<p>For it to be effective, people are required to have two doses of the vaccine 3 weeks apart and the NHS is urging people to ensure that they book their jabs when contacted and are emphasising the importance of attending both appointments: Dr Craig Dobson, medical advisor to the East Riding CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) said, “The vaccine has been shown to be effective and it is fantastic news that in our local area we can start to vaccinate our more vulnerable residents, who need it most.</p>
<p>“If you are in one of the priority groups, I would urge that when your GP Practice contacts you, please make sure you book and attend your appointments when you arrange them.”</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>

					&lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&amp;nbsp;UK&amp;nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video was produced during the visit, which can be viewed below:&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 2nd of December Hampshire will be in Tier 2, this means:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you must not socialise with anyone you do not live with or who is not in your support bubble in any indoor setting, whether at home or in a public place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you must not socialise in a group of more than 6 people outside, including in a garden or a public space&amp;nbsp;– this is called the ‘rule of 6’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;businesses and venues can continue to operate, in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;COVID-Secure&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;manner, other than those which remain closed by law, such as nightclubs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pubs and bars must close, unless operating as restaurants.

    <title>Letter from Cllr David Mellen to the PM on COVID Tiers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2020/11/25/letter-from-cllr-david-mellen-to-the-pm-on-covid-tiers/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;Cllr David Mellen&lt;br&gt;Leader, Nottingham City Council&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith tells Government ‘the people of the north will hold you to account’ on rebalancing the economy.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-tells-government-the-people-of-the-north-will-hold-you-to-account-on-rebalancing-the-economy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I took part in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DanJarvisMP&lt;/a&gt; debate on support for the economy in the North. We need a fundamental rebalancing of our economy after Covid. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this Government to account for their promises and their actions. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCcp6jNBhp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCcp6jNBhp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judith Cummins (@JudithCummins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudithCummins/status/1326541226452004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;

We're looking to relaunch the APPG and I'm hoping to hold a debate on the issue soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cprp_tags"&gt;Tags: judith, support, news, local, press&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div class="cprp_data"&gt;&lt;div class="cprp_title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-urges-pm-to-allow-visits-from-loved-ones/" title="Judith urges PM to allow visits from loved ones"&gt;Judith urges PM to allow visits from loved ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cprp_percentage"&gt;90&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cprp_excerpt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-urges-pm-to-allow-visits-from-loved-ones/" title="Judith urges PM to allow visits from loved ones"&gt;&lt;img src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JC-portrait-150x150.jpeg" class="cprp_thumbnail" title="Judith urges PM to allow visits from loved ones" alt="Judith urges PM to allow visits from loved ones" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="cprp_excerpt_content"&gt;Yesterday I urged the Prime Minister to do everything he can to keep care home residents &amp; staff safe and allow visits from loved ones where possible, including by testing family members.
