              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Sunday 14 November is World Diabetes Day. Over 4 million people in the UK are affected by diabetes, with 400,000 individuals having Type 1. The cause of Type 1 is unknown and is not a consequence of life choices, and many people are likely to have had it since childhood.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This year Dexcom have launched the #SeeDiabetes campaign to raise awareness and urge the government to invest in transformative CGM systems, which would significantly improve the lives of people living with Type 1 diabetes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">CGM systems work by measuring glucose at regular intervals using a sensor inserted just under the skin. Unlike fingerstick tests, which involve the patient pricking their finger up to 10 times a day, the devise wirelessly transmits glucose readings to a compatible smartphone and can alert users when their levels rise too high or drop too low, helping to reduce hyper and hypoglycaemia.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Whilst the technology has advanced, the ability of patients to access it on the NHS has not. Rather than being free at the point of use, access to the system is a postcode lottery with 47% of users having to self-fund it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The #SeeDiabetes campaign is calling on MPs to ask Parliamentary Questions about CGM technology and diabetes funding, and to table debates on the issue where possible in order to raise awareness in the House of Commons.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas MP for Dagenham and Rainham said:</strong> <em>“This is a really important campaign and could help transform the lives of people with Type 1 diabetes living in my constituency and across the country. Many with Type 1 have to self-fund CGM systems and I am calling on the government to invest in the technology to ensure it is made widely available on the NHS.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>“Whilst the campaign focuses on CGM tech and Type 1 it also provides an opportunity to raise awareness about those with Type 2. In Barking and Dagenham people are more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age, and it is something that needs addressing through the local NHS Trust with support from the CCGs and other health bodies.”</em>

    <title>Delivering for Sustainability in Future Planning Developments.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/11/09/delivering-for-sustainability-in-future-planning-developments/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the 13th of
January 2020 Nottingham Labour proposed and approved the Carbon Neutral Charter
and Action Plan. It was then agreed to declare a climate and ecological
emergency, to adopt the Carbon Neutral Charter and to consult on the Action
Plan. A strategic step was made, setting our ambitions for carbon neutrality by
2028.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the 19th of July this year
a motion was moved reiterating our ambition for carbon neutrality. As part of
that motion we committed to specific actions, including to “introduce a
Planning Department Sustainability Checklist as a matter of urgency …” We are
now delivering on this commitment;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buildings have an important
role to play in Nottingham’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality. That’s why the
draft informal planning sustainability checklist that went out in consultation
on the 18th of October is so significant. It’s the first step in holding the
development community accountable to higher ecological standards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This guidance requires
planning applications made for major developments to demonstrate how they help
the city meet its ambitions for carbon neutrality. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The policy proposes that new applications for development of 10 or
more residential or commercial units of 1000 m2 and above will need a Carbon
Reduction/Energy Statement to be submitted. On that statement the developers
will be asked to explain their proposed energy efficiency measures, their use
of renewable energy, sustainable design and construction features etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The document is intended when
possible, to encourage the use of technologies such as air source, ground
source heat pumps and photovoltaic panels for the generation of
energy/electricity on site reducing the reliance of future developments on the
national grid.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It’s also intended to encourage the use of LED
lighting, which uses 90% less energy than conventional bulbs, to increase the
provision of cycle spaces and EV charging points and to promote high fabric
standards protecting future buildings from energy loss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the 6th of November it was
the global day of action for climate justice. Climate activists, residents and
democratic representatives marched in Nottingham to demand justice for the
environment whilst at the same time talks were taking place at the United
Nations’s COP 26 summit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to encourage
Nottingham residents to help us get our policy-making right. The informal
sustainability planning guidance Nottingham City Council is consulting upon can
be viewed here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This draft paper will be in
consultation up until the 29th of November 2021 at 5pm. Do you have ideas on
how to improve/strengthen this policy document? Is there anything we missed? We
ask our communities to directly participate in planning policy formation by
sending comments and opinions by email to &lt;a href="mailto:localplan@nottinghamcity.gov.uk"&gt;localplan@nottinghamcity.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cllr Pavlos Kotsonis,
Executive Assistant for Planning and Heritage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/11/09/global-government-elite-restrictions/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Brexit vote was above all a vote to take back control from an unaccountable international body. People were fed up with rules and taxes that we had little influence over, that were then imposed against our wishes and enforced through a foreign political court.</p>
<p>Brexit voters want to see the promise that our votes would be respected and implemented seen through. We still have not taken back control of our fishing grounds, nor of Northern Ireland trade and   NI market rules and laws. This is unfinished business that the government needs to get on with.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some parts of the UK establishment, the senior civil service, the courts and the big quangos seem to  thrive on the idea that they can still get the UK signed up to international Agreements or Treaties to bind future governments and where necessary to thwart the wishes of  UK voters.</p>
<p>It is untrue to say the 2018 Global Compact for Migration signed by Mrs May is another such binding Treaty, as it expressly says it is not legally  binding and claims to respect the sovereignty of nations over  border matters. It is however part of a wide patchwork of international Agreements and more importantly  human rights law which is used by some to make it difficult for the Home Secretary to implement the public wish to see lower migration. The Home Secretary needs to come up with a strengthening of UK migration law to allow us to have sustainable and fair immigration.</p>
<p>Some are  similarly seeking to sign us up to as many international agreements under COP 28 as possible. These could  then  be used to limit UK freedom in making policy in everything from agriculture through transport to energy and industry, despite the fact that the world’s largest CO2 producers like China, Russia and India have not similarly committed. The UK needs to ensure that all the actions we take to cut carbon dioxide output cut the global output at the same time. International Agreements must be signed by  those who produce most CO2 as well as by us.  Ending up importing more from countries that do not control CO2 in the same way damages our economy whilst failing to tackle the CO2 totals.</p>
<p>An independent country needs to limit the amount of autonomy it signs away. Getting out of the EU is a huge step in the right direction, but we need to watch out for steps back again from a clever world establishment which does not trust the people nor the politicians who want to represent  their views. Some in the global  Establishment prefer to deal with politicians that they call grown ups, which means politicians who will ignore the public will or mislead the public over what is actually going on and who is in charge.</p>
<p>The most serious sacrifice of sovereignty was to the EU, with its binding legal structure and its own supreme court. Other international Agreements are subject to independent arbitration where there are disputes, and are best where there is a provision to allow a country to leave should circumstances alter.</p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP urges residents in Boston &amp; Skegness to protect themselves as the UK reaches historic milestone of 10 million booster jabs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2021/11/08/matt-warman-mp-urges-residents-in-boston-skegness-to-protect-themselves-as-the-uk-reaches-historic-milestone-of-10-million-booster-jabs/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>More than 10 million people across the UK – including 1,552,387 across the Midlands – have now received a COVID-19 booster or third jab to protect themselves and their loved ones this winter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Matt Warman is calling for vulnerable people in Boston &amp; Skegness who have not yet come forward to do so as soon as possible to help build our wall of defence and keep people safe over the winter months.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is making it easier than ever to get topped-up by allowing people to book their appointments five months after their second dose from Monday and making booster jabs available at walk-in centres without appointments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that 1,552,387 people in the Midlands have received their COVID-19 booster or third jab as the Conservative government continues to step up efforts to ensure that vulnerable people are fully protected against COVID-19 over the winter.</p>
<p>The latest figures show that more than 10 million people across the UK have received their COVID-19 booster or third jabs, ensuring the vital protection they have secured from their first two doses is maintained over the winter months.</p>
<p>A total of 10,062,704 people have received their booster and third jabs in the UK. 45,836,791 people have had two doses (79.7%) and 50,234,416 people have received one dose (87.4%).</p>
<p>Seven in 10 over 80s and three in five over-50s in England are already vaccinated with top-up jabs.</p>
<p>NHS England will be inviting another three million people who will become eligible for their booster next week. More than 13 million invites, including texts, letters and emails, have already been sent to eligible people in England so far asking them to book their booster online through the National Booking Service. The additional letters due to land next week will mean around 16 million invites have been sent in England since the NHS booster programme began.</p>
<p>The National Booking Service will be updated tomorrow (Monday 8 November) to allow those eligible for a booster vaccine – people over 50 and those most at risk of COVID-19 – to pre-book their jab five months after their second dose.</p>
<p>People will still receive their vaccine six months after their second dose, but the change will speed up the vaccination programme by allowing people to receive a jab the day they become eligible, rather than waiting for a convenient appointment.</p>
<p>People will also be able to book by calling 119 and can get vaccinated at hundreds of walk-in sites across the country six months after their second dose without an appointment. Those eligible can use the NHS online walk-in finder to locate the most convenient site.</p>
<p>COVID-19 booster vaccines have been delivered or booked in at every older adult care home in England where safe to do so, with almost nine in 10 care homes already visited.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolutely fantastic news that 1,552,387 people across the Midlands have received a booster dose or third vaccination, which will offer life-saving protection to them and their loved ones this winter.</p>
<p>“Those people, including everyone who has got their third jab in Boston &amp; Skegness, are part of the ten million people across the country who have already received a booster jab. I would urge anyone who is eligible and hasn’t yet come forward to get a booster jab as soon as possible, by booking online or at one of our local walk-in sites.</p>
<p>We can all do our bit this winter to protect our loved ones and the NHS, and to stay ahead in the race against the virus, by taking up the offer of a vaccine as soon as we are eligible.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“More than 10 million people across the UK now have the vital protection boosters provide, building our wall of defence and keeping people safe over the winter months. We know immunity begins to wane after six months, particularly for the elderly and at-risk groups, and booster jabs will ensure our most vulnerable are protected over the winter.</p>
<p>“It’s never been easier to get your top-up jabs now that those eligible can book in advance or visit hundreds of walk-in sites across the country.</p>
<p>“Please do not delay – get your vaccines as soon as you can to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter so we can keep the virus at bay.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes to Editors:</strong></p>
<p>The Conservative government is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling out the fastest vaccine programme in Europe, allowing us to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms.</strong> Almost nine in ten people aged 12 and over have now received a first vaccine dose – with almost eight in ten having also received a second dose. The latest data shows that vaccines have saved almost 130,000 deaths and prevented almost 250,000 hospitalisations. <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/"> Public Health England, Coronavirus Dashboard, accessed 21October 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Securing two new ground-breaking Covid antiviral drugs, preventing the spread of the virus and bolstering our defence for the winter months ahead.</strong> We have secured 730,000 doses of two new ground-breaking antiviral drugs – which will help to prevent the infection from spreading and speed up recovery times for people. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-secures-groundbreaking-covid-19-antivirals">DHSC, Press Release, 20 October 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Securing a portfolio of 517 million doses of the eight most promising vaccines through our Vaccine Taskforce for the whole of the Union.</strong> We have secured a portfolio of 517 million doses of the most promising vaccines, including over 210 million doses of the Oxford-Astrazenca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines being administered across the UK, as well as 20 million doses of the Janssen vaccine which be rolled out later this year. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/janssen-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-by-uk-medicines-regulator">DHSC, Press Release, 28 May 2021</a>; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-thirds-of-uk-adults-receive-first-dose-of-a-covid-19-vaccine">DHSC, Press Release, 7 May 2021</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting the NHS on a sustainable financial footing, so it is there for future generations.</strong> We will deliver around £12 billion a year in extra funding for our frontline health and social care across the UK over the next three years – a total of £36 billion. This is in addition to our historic settlement for the NHS in 2018, which will see its budget rise by £33.9 billion a year by 2023-24. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015736/Build_Back_Better-_Our_Plan_for_Health_and_Social_Care.pdf">Prime Minister’s Office, Build Back Better: Our Plan for Health and Social Care, 7 September 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Delivering the biggest catch-up programme in the NHS’s history, so that everyone can get the care they deserve.</strong> Over the next three years, will deliver the equivalent of around nine million more checks, scans and procedures – and elective activity will be around 30 per cent than it was before the pandemic. Once the NHS has recovered from the pandemic, activity should be ten per cent higher than under the NHS Long Term Plan. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015736/Build_Back_Better-_Our_Plan_for_Health_and_Social_Care.pdf">Prime Minister’s Office, Build Back Better: Our Plan for Health and Social Care, 7 September 2021</a></li>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-66/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Monday, the UK Conservative Government refused to endorse an anti-sleaze report by Lord Evans of Weardale, chair of the Committee on Standards of Public Life. In hindsight, this was an early indication of the Prime Minister’s stance that he would take on Wednesday when he opposed the Standards Committee’s report into the conduct of Owen Paterson MP. The report stated that Mr Paterson should receive a suspension of 30 days for being paid nearly £9000 a month by Randox and Lynn’s Country Foods to promote commercial interests, and by misusing his position as a former Government Minister, when he set up meetings for Randox and Lynn’s with UK Government Ministers and officials.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, as a member of the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/event/5569/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/">Petitions Committee</a>, I attended the first evidence session of tackling online abuse since the resumption of the Committee’s enquiry into this matter following the UK Government’s publication of its draft Online Safety Bill earlier this year. The Committee will be holding 3 evidence sessions this month, and will focus on the lived experience of people receiving online abuse; social, regulatory and technical solutions to online abuse; and the availability and enforcement of legal penalties for online abuse. In this first session we questioned 2 panels of 3 expert witnesses. The first panel consisted of Nancy Kelley, Chief Executive of Stonewall since June 2020; Danny Stone MBE, Chief Executive of the Antisemitism Policy Trust since 2009; and Matt Harrison of Mencap, Co-Chair of the Disability Benefits Consortium. The second panel was made up of Ruth Smeeth, former MP, and CEO of the Index on Censorship since 2020; Dr Chara Bakalis, Principal Lecturer in the School of Law at Oxford Brookes University; and Dr Joe Mughal, Senior Researcher at HOPE Not Hate, an anti-fascism and anti-racism organisation.</p>
<p>The Budget debates which started on the day of the Chancellor’s speech on Wednesday 27th October concluded on Tuesday night. We voted against the budget because the UK Conservative Government has no plan to: tackle the growing cost of living crisis; remove the enormous tax burden placed on working people and businesses; and to improve growth to boost our economy. And Wales was much maligned, as usual. Unfortunately, we lost the votes, and the budget was passed.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned, on Wednesday the Leader of the House, Rees-Mogg, brought forward a motion on the report of the Standards Committee report which had endorsed the conclusions of the Standard Commissioner (Kathryn Stone) investigation into the lobbying conduct of Owen Paterson MP. The cross party Standards Committee, chaired by Chris Bryant MP for Rhondda, which includes 4 Tory MPs, had endorsed the Commissioner’s 30-day sanction for breaching the rule on paid advocacy. Normal convention dictates that these reports are accepted by the House without divisions. However, as you have probably read in the media, Andrea Leadsom Conservative MP, former Leader of the House, tabled an amendment to the motion in order to save Mr Paterson from the report’s conclusion of a 30-day suspension, which would probably have triggered a recall petition, and could have resulted in a by-election for Mr Paterson’s seat. The amendment also linked the report to overhauling the standards system, that had found Mr Paterson guilty of paid advocacy, to change the rules retrospectively, and support cash for access. This was a blatant attempt to change due process, at the last stage of the process, to save a named individual who was a Conservative MP. All Conservative MPs were on a three-line whip to vote for the amendment, which means that they were ordered to vote for the amendment, because the Prime Minister had made it known that he and his Government supported the amendment. However, some Tory MPs rebelled and voted against the amendment and some abstained, so the amendment was passed by only 18 votes, whereas the Prime Minister normally has a majority of 80 at votes taken in the Commons.</p>
<p>The Leadsom amendment included a proposal to set up another standards committee made up of 8 backbenchers, 4 Tories, 3 Labour, 1 SNP – and the chair had already been chosen – former Tory minister John Wittingdale MP. It is ironic that when Leadsom was Leader of the House, and brought forward the motion to set up the original Standards Committee on 7th January 2019, she said that the committee provided the right balance – having 7 lay members with independent experience and 7 Parliamentary members. Leadsom’s new standards committee would have no independent input, and be a rival to the original standards committee.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip seriously misjudged the magnitude of the backlash to this manipulation of Parliamentary process. The opposition Parties subsequently refused to take part in the new Leadsom committee and many Tories made it known publicly and privately that they disagreed with changing the rules at this time in order to save one of their own MPs.</p>
<p>Leadsom and the Prime Minister’s victory was short lived. On Thursday morning Rees-Mogg announced a U-turn in the Commons. He accepted the Standards Committee’s report, the sanction for Mr Paterson, and he scrapped the setting up of a rival standards committee. Then on Thursday afternoon Owen Paterson resigned as an MP – avoiding his 30 day suspension sanction, a recall petition, and a by-election. But of course there will now be a by-election to replace him, and the repercussions of the Prime Minister’s actions have continued with many senior Tories, such as former Prime Minister John Major, publicly criticising Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>As a Vice-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Boxing, I was honoured to chair the “Women in Boxing” virtual event. We had 5 amazing female guest speakers who told their stories about the challenges and obstacles that they have experienced in their chosen sport. Natasha Jonas, who was the first female boxer to compete for GB Boxing and the first female boxer to qualify for the Olympics. Natasha is a professional boxer who has fought for the WBC and IBO female super-featherweight titles in August 2020. Hilary Lissenden, former board director of England Boxing, the CEO of London Community Boxing, and Head of Sport at the Mayor of London’s office. Dr Kathy Adcock, is founder of “In Your Corner”, a boxing club which helps children and adults at risk of, or under referral to mental health services, and is a registered HCPC Clinical Psychologist, a boxer, and accredited England Boxing coach. Holly Hefferon is a young female boxer at the Heart of Portsmouth Boxing Club, and Sameenah Toussaint is a young female boxer at New Kings Boxing Club. It was a full and frank discussion with many online participants asking questions of our guests. There was general agreement on the practical and social issues facing women in boxing, for example: feeling intimidated by male boxers and male coaches; boxing is an old fashioned sport biased towards men; there are no female changing rooms in most clubs; when sparring, males either took it easy or went full on; a lack of female coaches; the chest protective gear is so uncomfortable that many females don’t wear it; there are no separate rooms at weigh-ins and the supervising officials are male; there are less weight divisions than in male boxing, which leads to mis-matches; the massive gender disparity in prize money; and many social media negative comments such as – female boxers not being feminine. But on the positive side – after the 2012 Olympics – female boxing has become more accepted; more females are taking part; with more funding opportunities; there are more female coaching staff and more female referees and judges; and better designed female boxing kit. However, the participants in the meeting concluded that, even though great progress has been achieved, there was still a long way to go before female boxing achieves parity.</p>
<p>Members of the Petitions Committee have the opportunity to open debates, and on 15th November I shall be opening on behalf of Parliamentary Petitions 323926 and 575620 which relate to road traffic offences for fatal collisions. The petitions call for tougher sentences for hit and run drivers who cause death, and seeks to introduce “Ryan’s Law” which proposes to change the written definition of death by dangerous driving. The current maximum penalty for failing to stop after a vehicle collision is licence points, plus 6 months custodial sentence. And the penalty for causing death by careless or dangerous driving is a custodial sentence of 5-14 years.</p>
<p>I held a virtual meeting with the petitioners – Louise Smyth and Helen Wood, whose sons Matt aged 25, and Paul aged 23, both died in separate motorbike accidents and in each accident, the person who caused the accident left the accident scene. Matt and Paul were best friends, and died within 9 months of each other. Leanne Saltern whose brother Ryan (Ryan’s Law) aged 31, died in a road accident, and their parents, Helen and Mark were also in the meeting. I listened to their harrowing accounts of the accidents, the deaths, and how it has affected them, and the reasons why they are fighting for justice for people who may be killed in similar circumstances in the future. It was a very emotional meeting, and I shall do my very best to represent the petitioners at the forthcoming debate.</p>
<p>This week the annual Poppy Appeal started in Parliament with a Poppy Ride. It’s such an important time of the year for raising awareness of those who have given so much in service to their country. The Royal British Legion are not just around in November, however, and work tirelessly throughout the year to ensure that serving personnel, veterans, and their families are supported with the challenges that they may face. The Legion are there with everything from physical and mental wellbeing to financial and employment support and it’s our donations that help make that happen. You can donate in any way you choose – whether that’s buying a poppy on the high street, making a donation online, or taking part in a charity event. See <a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/poppy-appeal">the website</a> for more information. I am very honoured to be asked to deliver the reading, the Gospel of St. Mark Chapter 1 vv 14-20, at the Remembrance Service in St. David’s Church in Neath on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> November, led by our Rector, Canon Lynda Newman.</p>
<p>Last week was UK Parliament Week – a great way for people to learn more about politics in the UK and how to participate actively. A thriving democracy relies on participation and communication between elected representatives and our constituents. It’s especially important to engage young people in politics – this is their country and many of the challenges that we face today will have to be dealt with by the younger generations. However, whenever I speak to young people in our schools and visiting local activities, I am thrilled to see the passion and engagement in the issues that they find important. UK Parliamentary outreach happens throughout the year, not only during this week and there are plenty of ways to get involved. Find out more on their <a href="https://www.ukparliamentweek.org/en/resources/">website</a>.</p>
<p>This week applications opened for the Queen’s Green Canopy Project. This is a fantastic scheme which ensures everyone in the UK has the opportunity to contribute to tree-planting, so I’d encourage schools and community groups in Neath to apply for their free tree and commemorate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee at the same time.  Together we can help the UK plant enough trees to reach its 2050 carbon net-zero target. Find out more about the scheme and apply for a tree <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/schools-and-communities/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Trustees week I  gave my thanks to the 137 charities in Neath and their trustees who play a vital role in running a charity, volunteering their time to help make important decisions about their charity’s work, and providing advice and guidance to help charities make a difference.  We can all be proud of our community champions who support so many people in our area and do great work for Neath.  If you are interested in becoming a trustee, find out more about what this involves <a href="https://trusteesweek.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152 – we are here to help.</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/11/05/weekly-round-up-8/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-8" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to be able to ask a question during the debate on the Plan for Jobs this week and ask the Economic Secretary to the Treasury about the Government’s plans to significantly reduce the number of BTECs. I recently visited the newly opened jobcentre in Knowle which supports people back to work and I have previously been chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Apprenticeships. I have seen how crucial these qualifications are to young people in Bristol South and I cannot fathom why the Government is abolishing BTECs. I wanted to know if an Impact Assessment of the decision had been done and whether the Government would reconsider. The answer contained no mention of an assessment and was merely a reiteration of previous promises of investment in T-levels and apprenticeships, but it is simply not going far enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work on improving Trailer Safety continues following a hasty decision by the Government to bring in legislation that would allow ‘light’ trailer towing without an additional test to ascertain the safety and knowledge of drivers. Studies have suggested that failure rates for this trailer towing test, known as the B+E test, are at around 30% – 8,575 people failed the test in 2019-20. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government’s decision to scrap the test which gives drivers the knowledge on how to tow safely is extremely concerning, particularly as they have made this legislation without conducting any assessment of the impact this will have on safety on the roads. No one should be driving with a trailer that is not safe, and I have raised questions with the Ministers concerned to highlight the potentially disastrous implications of this measure.  This matters because the consequences of unsafe trailers are catastrophic. Donna and Scott Hussey’s son Freddie was killed as he walked along Parson Street in Bedminster with his mum in 2014 when he was hit by a 2-tonne trailer that had come loose from a Land Rover. The trailer’s tow hitch was not secure as the position of its handbrake prevented it from being locked down. This terrible accident should never have happened. We need greater trailer safety and testing to prevent senseless tragedies like Freddie’s death from ever happening again. The government’s decision to rush through this ill-thought through legislation is a bitter blow for all those campaigning for greater safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday morning I spoke to BBC Radio Bristol about the Assisted Dying Bill.  I strongly believe that in the end stages of someone’s life, they should have a choice over their treatment.  Research shows that in countries where assisted dying is legal, the amount of people who actually choose to go down this path is very low, but having that choice gives so many people the peace of mind and a sense of control, just as we expect in other stages in our lives.  The safeguards proposed by the Assisted Dying Bill, including requiring a six months terminal diagnosis and two independent evaluations by different doctors, would ensure assisted dying could take place safely, as it already does in countries around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to join in with the Industry and Parliamentary Trust’s Poppy Ride on Wednesday in Portcullis House. It’s a fun competition for MPs and parliamentary staff but there is a serious message and I was very happy to support this fantastic organisation and thrilled that I managed to cycle 2.1km in 5 minutes! The sale of poppies each year supports the vital work of the Royal British Legion who help look after our serving personnel as well as our veterans and their families. British Legion fundraising continues throughout the year and you can also take part in a Poppy Ride next May. On the </span><a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/things-to-do/events/poppy-ride"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website to register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can also read the testimonials of those who have been helped by the work of the Royal British Legion and see the vital work that your donations contribute to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for the Queen’s Green Canopy Project are now officially open.  Schools and community groups in Bristol South can apply for a free tree as part of the scheme, and it’s a fantastic way to green our community and commemorate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK needs millions more trees to reach its 2050 carbon net-zero target, so this is a great way to do your bit and help us reach this goal. Find out more about the scheme and apply for a tree </span><a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/schools-and-communities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week is Trustees Week, so I want to give my thanks to the 115 charities and their trustees in Bristol South who do so much for local people.  Charities are the backbone of our communities and have kept so many people going through the difficult years of the pandemic, despite times being so tough for charities themselves.  Trustees voluntarily give up their time to help make our neighbourhoods the best places to live – I am grateful to all of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/11/05/weekly-round-up-8/">Weekly Round-Up</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

  <summary type="text">This week, local MP Tim Farron met with the Immigration Minister Kevin Foster to make the case for the Government to fix the staffing crisis in the Lake District hospitality and tourism sector.
Tim encouraged the minister to extending the Youth Mobility Scheme visa to European countries.

<p>Tim encouraged the minister to extending the Youth Mobility Scheme visa to European countries.</p>
<p>The visa allows young people aged 18-30 to come and live and work in the UK for up to two years but is currently only available to Australia, Canada, Monaco, New Zealand and San Marino.</p>
<p>The latest research conducted by Cumbria Tourism found that 85% of businesses in the sector are struggling with recruitment issues.</p>
<p>On average, 14% of available roles are vacant (up to 50% for some businesses), with 86% reporting a lack of applicants for roles.</p>
<p>Over half of businesses surveyed cite the loss of European staff post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"I'm grateful to the minister for giving his time to listen to my case.</em></p>
<p><em>"Of course first and foremost I want to see young people from Cumbria given the opportunities to work in our world class hospitality and tourism industry.</em></p>
<p><em>"However with around 80% of the local working age population in the Lake District already working in this sector, it's always been clear that we need people from outside the area to fill the huge recruitment gaps.</em></p>
<p><em>"Fundamentally, if the Government fail to take the necessary action to fix this it will be local businesses and local workers that will suffer."</em></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>I have spoken out against the Government’s plans to pass a new bill to reorganise the NHS in England.</p>
<p>As a long-time campaigner against NHS privatisation, previously resigning as Chair of Rochdale Primary Care Trust over concerns of the increase in use of private healthcare companies in the NHS, I am speaking out this time against the Government’s Health and Care Bill.</p>
<p>The action comes as a new poll by We Own It, the campaign for public ownership of public services, shows that 8 in 10 people want the Government to fix waiting lists and ensure that people can see their GPs face-to-face as their top priority, compared to just 2 in 10 who said reorganising the NHS should be a top priority.</p>
<p>The Bill, which had its second reading in the House of Commons on 14 July, is expected to enter the next stage of its passage on 9 November. The Bill will divide the NHS in England into 42 areas, called Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), each with its own budget and a board to oversee the delivery of health services for the area.</p>
<p>This is the wrong bill at the wrong time.</p>
<p>To introduce a bill like this when the Covid pandemic is far from over, and staff are on their knees, shows a lack of understanding of what’s needed. I’m also concerned that this re-organisation of the NHS is being used as an opportunity to extend the involvement of UK and international private healthcare companies.</p>
<p>The bill is proposing that private healthcare companies can become members of integrated care boards (ICBs) potentially procuring health services from their own companies, and this is entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Campaigners and trade unionists say the Bill will allow private companies to sit on the boards that oversee the new ICSs and make decisions about how the budget is spent. They also claim that by repealing Section 75 of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which required that all contracts be put through a competitive tendering process, the Bill will open the NHS to more crony contracts.</p>
<p>The new poll also shows that 70% of the public, including 70% of Conservative voters and 82% of Labour voters, say they are worried that the Bill would open the NHS to contracts being given out to private companies without scrutiny. 60% of those polled say they want the Bill to be amended to make NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts the default providers of all NHS services.</p>
<p>The Westminster protest was joined by more than 35 Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and SNP Members of Parliament. Organisers say further local actions are planned to take place in more than 100 constituencies, with local people dropping off letters to their MP’s offices asking them to oppose the Health and Care bill.</p>
<p>The protest was organised by We Own It and Just Treatment, a patient-led group that represents the voice of patients. It was also supported by Unite the Union, the British Medical Association, the National Pensioners Convention, and more.</p>
<p>Johnbosco Nwogbo, Campaigns Lead for We Own It, one of the key organisations involved in the action said: “This Bill will put on steroids the government’s unlawful contracting we’ve seen during the pandemic. With the Secretary of State for Health set to receive increased powers in this bill, Sajid Javid will be enabled to simply hand out contracts to party donors and friends without any kind of scrutiny”.</p>
<p>He added, “It’s clear that a lot of MPs are really worried about how this bill will change our NHS and open it to being used as a profit-making venture for profit-greedy private companies within it. We just hope more of them, including Conservatives, will speak out.”</p>
<p>Hope Worsdale, Digital Comms and Campaign Lead from Just Treatment, said: “All the patients we work with are deeply worried about the future of our NHS, so this week we took the fight against this dangerous Bill to right outside Parliament, and it was fantastic to be joined by so many MPs. This parliamentary support shows that our campaigning is working, and that we have people in the House of Commons willing to fight for the future of our NHS. We know that the government’s plans will fail patients across the country – so now we need even more people to get involved in ramping up the pressure on their MPs to reject the bill.”</p>

<p>I recently met, on Zoom, with constituents from B30 Churches Together to think about Cop26 and discuss what might be done locally to tackle climate change.</p>



<p>We talked about community recycling, cleaner transport and many other initiatives and they reminded me of the positive impact that the Jubilee 2000 Debt Campaign had on world leaders.</p>



<p>Cop26 is the annual meeting of the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It&#8217;s expected to attract 30,000 attendees, not to mention thousands more for fringe events, plus all the security personnel and protestors. That&#8217;s a lot of air miles!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also surprised that the minister, chosen by Boris Johnson to oversee Cop26, had to fly to over 30 countries, travelling some 200,000 miles, that&#8217;s eight times round the earth, as part of his preparations.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not very environmentally friendly, especially in an age of Zoom.</p>



<p>Cop26 is supposed to agree trading rules for carbon, a $100 billion dollar fund to help poorer countries, decide how to end dependence on fossil fuels like coal and oil and set realistic measures to reach net zero before it&#8217;s too late.</p>



<p>A green economy can provide the jobs for the future. JLR should be helped to build electric cars and we need a giga factory in Coventry for the batteries they&#8217;ll require.</p>



<p>The Energy Research Accelerator projects in Birmingham can deliver hydrogen fuel, combined heat and power and smart, energy efficient homes.</p>



<p>Green jobs and a green economy are the way forward but I wonder if our government is treating it seriously enough.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve finally produced their long-awaited Heat and Buildings strategy with promises of £5,000 grants to phase out gas boilers and convert to heat pumps. It sounds good, except that a conversion of that kind costs about £20,000 per household and their plans only cover 30,000 homes per year while their own targets say it should be 600,000.</p>



<p>I want to share the hope and optimism Churches Together draw from the Jubilee 2000 campaign but right now Glasgow looks like a bit like a jamboree when what we need is leadership and real action designed to save the planet.</p>

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP John Penrose has welcomed over £2.8million in Government cash to support levelling up Weston and North Somerset.</p>



<p>The funding comes as a result of the Council&#8217;s Community Renewal Fund bid that John wrote to the Government in support of back in July.</p>



<p>The money will be put towards a number of projects aimed at increased business resilience, boosting local employability, work towards zero carbon targets, and a series of community hubs</p>



<p>John said: &#8220;This is a large sum of money from the Government for imaginative new approaches and programmes that unleash local potential and instil pride in the community. I&#8217;m a huge believer in levelling up areas outside of London &#8211; it brings money into our local economy; makes it easier to succeed for existing businesses and more attractive for new businesses to come here; it means improved opportunities, wages, and living standards for people who live here too. Like everyone in Weston, I look forward to seeing this money put into action!&#8221;</p>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is supporting a Bill which aims to ban plastic in wet wipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill was introduced to Parliament on Tuesday by Labour MP Fleur Anderson, and has cross-party backing alongside the support of Thames Water and leading ecological and wildlife charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 11 billion wet wipes are sold in the UK every year and 90% of these contain plastic. This is the equivalent of 163 wet wipes per person. The plastic in wet wipes breaks down into microplastics, which can be ingested by marine and riverine animals. 100 million marine animals die each year from plastic waste alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wet wipes are blockages in UK sewers, and are changing the shape of rivers as they pile up on beds and banks. There is currently relatively little regulation or government policy governing the manufacture, advertising and guidance on wet wipes. Non-plastic wet wipe alternatives include: bamboo fibre wipes, plant-based wipes, organic cotton wipes and washable re-usable cloths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting the Bill, Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plastic pollution is a huge issue. In my constituency, the River Tame has the largest concentration of microplastics in any river in Britain, and it’s caused in no small part by the plastics in things like wet wipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleur’s Bill would make a simple change to legislation but have huge environmental benefits. I’m proud to be supporting it, and I hope that as it progresses through Parliament, it receives the Government and cross-party support it needs to come into law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USEFUL COMPUTER GAMES FOR CHILDREN</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/useful-computer-games-for-children/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s children master the computer even before school. Not all parents like it: dubious entertainment that can grow into an addiction. On the other hand, the world is changing, and it will definitely need IT-specialists and robotics. By the way you can find fastest payout online casino in New Zealand &lt;a href="https://newzealandcasinosonline.co.nz/fastest-payout-online-casinos/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;1. Pay attention to your child&amp;#8217;s interests&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A deep interest in the computer, in &amp;#8220;how everything works&amp;#8221;, in contrast to a passion for games, does not occur just like that. Initially the child shows abstract thinking, interest in logical operations, solving problems. It is important to notice this interest in time and develop it: with strategic games, constructors, interesting applications: Scratch, Factorio, CodeCombat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;2. Suggest games for the development of abstract thinking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Playing games on the computer for a 3-year-old child is not the best option. For children 3-4 years old simple games are more useful. Developing &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; thinking in kids will help with logic problems, a construction set, puzzles, plasticine. At this age, it is important to get to know one&amp;#8217;s space and body, and to develop motor skills, including those guided by parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;3 Don&amp;#8217;t try to remake your child.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better help him or her develop their abilities. The example of the current world chess champion Magnus Carlsen is illustrative. He belongs to the first generation of sportsmen who got an opportunity to train while sitting in front of the computer without constantly going to the chess club (at the age of 8 Magnus was blitzing in the Internet for several hours a day). The future champion was a reserved child, but always showed an interest in logical problems. His parents noticed this and helped him by steering him in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;4. Determine the appropriate age&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children are ready to approach programming consciously from the age of 12. At this age they memorize quickly, begin to grasp key concepts. That&amp;#8217;s when you can give them a programming or development course. For younger children, simple games with parental supervision are more suitable: puzzles, lego, board games with strategy building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;5. Choose the right computer games&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If useful computer games for children 4 years old is not easy to find, then educational games for a child 7 years on the computer &amp;#8211; not so rare. Contrary to parental stereotypes, there are many useful games and apps for school children. The best ones are the ones where the child not only plays, but also participates in the creation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scratch (from 7 years old). A variant for the youngest. You can easily build animations, simple games, cartoons.&lt;br&gt;CodeCombat (9-14 years old). The design is similar to a real online game, while using writing code for game mechanics. For example, for a character to go forward &amp;#8211; you have to write a command to jump &amp;#8211; to create some code.&lt;br&gt;Swift Playgrounds (10-15 years). A good option for spending a few evenings with your child. This is not only a beautiful toy, it teaches the basics of the Swift language, in which mobile and desktop applications for Apple devices are written.&lt;br&gt;Factorio (ages 12 and up). This game helps develop systemic thinking and logic by building complex conveyors and factories and extracting resources, doing research and building infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;Human Resource (age 12 and up). A good cartoon game where you have to solve algorithmic tasks, similar to those faced by programmers.&lt;br&gt;Maincraft (ages 12-16). An add-on to the game Maincraft in the form of a local server. This is more of a &amp;#8220;teen + parent&amp;#8221; format. Adults should be willing to dive in: help with set-up and walkthrough tasks.&lt;br&gt;SHENZHEN I/O (ages 16 and up). A game that teaches how to program boards in the assembly language. Suitable for keen teenagers and for adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you should stick to the rule: &amp;#8220;We only play games that we have written ourselves.&amp;#8221; So the child is better able to remember the rules of coding, and all the time he wants to improve his game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These games are essentially programs for learning code, only adapted for children. But there is also a base on how to work with code: Processing, Studio Code, Python I.&lt;br&gt;If you are looking for minimum deposit casinos in Canada you can visit &lt;a href="https://bestcasinocanadaonline.com/5-minimum-deposit-casinos-in-canada/"&gt;https://bestcasinocanadaonline.com/5-minimum-deposit-casinos-in-canada/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;6. Some programming languages even teenagers can master&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basics of web development, programming languages Java and Python, big data processing can be learned at the age of 14-15. The acquired skills will be appreciated by employers in different areas, not only in programming. For example, a science lab needs someone who knows how to process big data with computer programs. A journalist who understands the basics of web development will be able to launch his or her own Internet publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-37/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Covid and other local issues. If you are receiving one of these emails for the first time, it is because you have contacted me recently. I have been sending these updates throughout the pandemic to help provide information to people about what is going on locally. If you do not want to be included in further updates about the pandemic and other issues, please use the unsubscribe button at the bottom of this message.</p>
<h3><strong>Booster dose of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine</strong></h3>
<p>A number of people have contacted me to say that they have been unable to organise booster jabs when they thought they should be receiving them. I have checked this and the trigger point for eligibility comes six months and one week after the second vaccine jab earlier in the year. So anyone who had their jab on May 1st would be able to get their jab from next week.</p>
<p>If you are eligible but have not yet received an invitation to book from the NHS, please use <a href="https://news.chrisgrayling-mp.org.uk/4F6F6E5283BF934361A94E3CEA6B1685D0D29CAE573DBB1E3486A2A25B4F9FB9/5D97560853D6236792D3116494E87D84/LE35"><strong>this link</strong></a> to do so.</p>
<h3><strong>Face-to-face GP appointments</strong></h3>
<p>Many people have also contacted me about the availability of face to face appointments with local GPs. I know that this has been a frustration for many people. But I should also say that both GPs and the NHS have been under enormous pressure in recent months and the level of demand for appointments of all sorts has been very high indeed.</p>
<p>For many people a virtual appointment is a much easier way to deal with a GP. But I have spoken to the leadership of the NHS in Surrey and they have told me that anyone who needs a face to face appointment should be able to get one.</p>
<h3><strong>Train services to London</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you who are commuters, I am stepping up pressure on the train companies and the Department for Transport to get back to a much closer to normal timetable. The Tattenham Corner direct trains have now been restored, and I have been promised that there will be a regular through service from Ashtead and Epsom to London Bridge in the peak by next May at the latest, though I am pushing for this to be earlier.</p>
<p>There remains a serious issue around the SWR services to Waterloo and I have asked for a further meeting with the company about what is happening. If you find yourself on a train which is very overcrowded and people are struggling to get on as it gets closer to central London, it would be very helpful if you could let me know.</p>
<h3><strong>The Chalk Pit Site Epsom</strong></h3>
<p>The controversial planning application for the Chalk Pit in Epsom is due to be heard by the County Council on the 17th November. I have also met the Secretary of State to discuss the performance of the Environment Agency on the issue, and there is now an investigation taking place to see whether they have taken sufficient action on the blight to local residents.</p>
<p>I will continue to do what I can to get the issue resolved.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooding issues in Nork &amp; Tattenhams</strong></h3>
<p>Last Thursday I was at a meeting with councillors and local residents in Nork and Tattenhams and Surrey County Council about the flooding issue in the area. If you were not able to be there and your home is affected by the problem, please do<strong> <a href="mailto:chris.grayling.mp@parliament.uk">get in touch</a> </strong>and I will update you about the potential ways forward that were discussed.Future Mole Valley Local Plan</p>
<h3><strong>Mole Valley Local Plan</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you in Ashtead, the deadline to comment on the Mole Valley local plan is this coming weekend. I know that many people are very concerned about the scale of what is proposed by the Council for the area around Ashtead. If you want to comment, the link is <a href="https://news.chrisgrayling-mp.org.uk/87667194E53429415FEB1B971292AA929B66B9C20B22D6D0E3A2D094918BEBA1/5D97560853D6236792D3116494E87D84/LE35"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you have any particular issues that you need to raise, please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

    <title>ARTICLE: How long can we survive shackled to Westminster?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Government is all about making choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;In his budget, the UK Chancellor had the opportunity to do the decent thing for millions of people affected by the combination of rising costs and income that fails to match it. He chose not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that inflation and higher taxes would dwarf any small increases for middle-wage earners and that low-income households will feel &amp;#8220;real pain&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;They pointed out that families struggling on Universal Credit must endure a £20 per week and that the Chancellor&amp;#8217;s adjustments won&amp;#8217;t make up for that cut, even before national insurance rises come in the Spring. Another organisation, initially set up by the UK Government to monitor spending, said that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years. Inflation is set to soar over 4% &amp;#8211; that has a massive effect on the ability of households to meet their living costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Here in the Highlands, we have the extra challenges of having higher transport costs and higher costs for energy and fuel.  In households across our communities, people no longer have to choose between food and heat – because thanks to this Chancellor and this UK Government,  they cannot afford to buy either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;In the spending review, the Chancellor chose not to invest in children who have the most difficult starts in life. He chose not to invest in sorting the mess created by Brexit – felt in every household in Scotland and across the nations of the UK. Instead, he chose to give a tax cut to his old pals in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;It seems there is no money to invest in tackling the fact that the UK has the worst poverty levels in western Europe. Still, there was money for encouraging more short-haul air travel &amp;#8211; on the eve of the COP 26 Climate conference. There is also money for cutting tax on ships that will fly the British flag and multinational companies, like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;And, whilst any money for our region is welcome, let&amp;#8217;s not fall for the small pockets of money earmarked for Highland projects. The money offered up is nothing compared to the EU money lost to the region, and it does not even come close to the £83 million still missing from the City Region Deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;A Tory Chancellor at Westminster made his choices. Like every other Tory budget or spending review that came before – he made them for ideological reasons. To them, if anyone is poor, that&amp;#8217;s their hard luck – they just have to try harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;The fact is, those who are the poorest today have spent most of their lives governed by people who have no concept about what it is like to live without privilege. There is always money for contracts for pals, never for hard-pressed families. History shows us that the choices Westminster makes for us are never going to change. We need different choices to be made, to see fairness, justice, and hope for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Scotland will thrive without Westminster, but how long can we survive being shackled to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in politics may now mean for certain that a referendum on Scottish independence is blocked and the only avenue to ask the population the question on independence is at an election.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;#8217;s Supreme Court decision on blocking Scottish Parliament bills was a seismic event which could affect the independence process for Scotland for years to come.&amp;nbsp; The court told Scotland, pretty bluntly, what we all should actually know, that power devolved is power retained, and Scotland’s parliament is not the most powerful parliament in Scotland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;129 MSPs of all the parties, who all backed the legislation incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the European Charter on Local Self Government thought this legislation was within the powers of the Scottish Parliament – but it was not.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the politicians can be excused given 3 groups of lawyers likely thought similarly.&amp;nbsp; Namely, the Scottish Government’s lawyers, the Scottish Parliament’s lawyers and the Scotland Office’s lawyers all, thought the same, (the latter of course being the lawyers of Tory Secretary of State Alister Jack), for these Bills to reach Royal Assent stage.&amp;nbsp; All have been reminded that Holyrood is, indeed, closer to a council than a sovereign parliament, clearly a trapped vassal, which might come as a surprise to most at Holyrood.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently I went to a Holyrood Magazine award ceremony, (I am not often around Holyrood) and was seated at a table with some convivial Labour and Tory MSPs.&amp;nbsp; What struck me about the event, is that all MSPs see themselves as parliamentarians in a proper parliament and vassals of no one.&amp;nbsp; Alas to paraphrase Dylan Thomas, “They sing in their chains like the sea”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the Supreme Court has just reminded the Scottish Parliament that they have had clipped wings from the outset, as opposed to being the body that clipped their wings, as some construe the Court’s ruling.&amp;nbsp; The Court is the referee making judgements on the law as it stands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the question arises, what will happen to a contentious Referendum Bill, where MSPs and 3 groups of lawyers will certainly not agree, with many voices convinced that this too is outside the powers of the Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the SNP’s architect of the “11 Point Plan” for a referendum in this Scot Parliamentary term, incorporated a visit to the Supreme Court at Point 10, reaching Point 11 may well be a forlorn hope. I certainly would not bet on the Scottish Government managing to hold a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people in the only debate forum we have had in this area, Twitter, feel that any denial of a mandated referendum is riding roughshod over democracy, it may well be, and I have every sympathy, but such an opinion is not considering the vassal creature that is the Scottish Parliament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Scottish Parliament looks to be no freer in organising a referendum on Scottish independence, than the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar might be to have a referendum for rescinding the 1266 Treaty of Perth and&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;return the Hebrides to Norway.&amp;nbsp; Either body, the council or the Scottish Parliament may get a mandate for something, but if it is not within their powers to deliver, they therefore cannot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not to say all is lost for independence, it is just to say that a referendum is likely to be blocked regardless of the party in power in Scotland whether it be the SNP, Greens, Alba or the man in the moon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flipside is that the Tory Government at Westminster are clearly very anxious that the Scottish people do not get asked on independence.&amp;nbsp; Hence, they will do all they can to prevent the Scottish people giving a verdict on the issue.&amp;nbsp; The best way the UK Government sees to achieve that end, is ensuring their vassal Scottish Parliament cannot hold a referendum, by blocking the asking of a question, because the answer could be problematic for them. If the Scottish people demonstrate a democratic desire for independence, this a problem for Tory Westminster does not want to arise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with a referendum effectively ruled out, the Tories will still raise it as an issue not because it has a chance of happening but because it will keep their unionist voters twitchy and anxious, and the Tories hope they will continue to almost unthinkingly vote Tory for reasons of constitutional angst.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If referendums are indeed to be blocked, due to lack of power at the Scottish Parliament, then the clever thing to do will be to use elections, in fact it will be the only ballot-box option left open. Elections also happen every 5 years which may console nationalists needlessly nervous of losing a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alternative to a referendum on independence is not unthinkable &amp;#8211; it is humdrum now!&amp;nbsp; Further we should not wallow in the &amp;#8220;tranquilising drug of gradualism&amp;#8221; as Martin Luther King might have cautioned.&amp;nbsp; For the good of society, national and international, we need an urgency in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some cynics may feel that sharp minds in the Scottish Government are quite aware the Referendum Bill will falter and hence there is no rush to push the Bill in Holyrood. Later disappointment is better than early disappointment from an activist management point of view. Who would want to face activists when pertinent warnings for a Plan B&amp;nbsp; have been wilfully ignored?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it must be dawning now on the few minds that were too thrawn to allow a debate on “Plan B” in the last few years, that now there is probably no other option but to use an election for independence.&amp;nbsp; It was quipped before the 2021 election that the 2026 election would be the 2021 election for slow learners. Let us hope that the 2031 election is not therefore the 2026 election for the most stubborn of slowest learners.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Best we all get our heads around the simple fact that there likely will be no referendum before the next Scottish election, which for the purposes of a majority and the franchise, will be the next best independence opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Independence needs the permission of the people and can neither be declared or indeed conversely denied by opposing sets of politicians.  There is always hope, with clever moves reacting to an opponent’s strategy and even a vassal parliament can pull off a checkmate, but only if we can capture the will of the people for independence in the ballot boxes of Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my October email newsletter. It has been a busy but sombre month in parliament, as the Spending Review has been&nbsp;published in full and we celebrate the life, and mourn the death, of James Brokenshire MP and Sir David Amess MP.</p>



<p>Below you’ll find updates on the Budget, local Covid-19 case rates, a new charity in Langley Mill, more support for local pubs, an explanation on proposed&nbsp;amendments to the Environment Bill, and my view on a mayor for the East Midlands.</p>



<p><strong><u>Autumn Budget &amp; Spending Review</u></strong></p>



<p>On Wednesday 27th October, the Chancellor released the Autumn Budget and Spending Review, revealing the Government’s plans for spending, taxes, and borrowing. Prior to its release, I expected to see some pretty alarming public finances as a result of the pandemic, and to be fair, we have seen some difficult&nbsp;numbers. The deficits for the last financial year and the current year total £500 billion, and we will still be running a deficit this year of about £130 billion.</p>



<p>However, despite the storm of the pandemic crashing over our economy, it is forecasted that the books will be completely balanced in the financial year after next. I could not possibly have expected that we could go from the economic tempest that was the pandemic, back to balanced public finances in less than a couple of years. This is a tremendous achievement. That we can even forecast that position demonstrates how successful the Government’s measures to save the economy have been over the past 18 months.</p>



<p>The success of these forecasts depends largely upon the growth of our economy. At the minute, the UK economy is growing faster than our major international competitors, more people are in work, and growth is up. However, uncertainty in the global economy means that this rate of recovery is not guaranteed. Therefore, we need to focus on what more we can do to increase the long-term trend in the rate of growth. That is why we need to make sure that the very welcome measures to increase investment, improve skills, and boost productivity are driven through and made to work.</p>



<p>Policies of particular interest to the residents of Amber Valley include:</p>



<p>. More money for local NHS services and schools;</p>



<p>. Increasing the National Living Wage by 6.6% to £9.50;&nbsp;</p>



<p>. The end of the public sector pay freeze;</p>



<p>. A 5% cut to pub beer duty through a new Draught Relief, simplifying wider alcohol duties and freezing fuel duty;</p>



<p>. Cutting business rates by at least 50% next year for 90% of retail, hospitality and leisure businesses;&nbsp;</p>



<p>. A reduction in the universal credit taper from the current 63p to 55p &#8211; allowing claimants who are in work to keep more of their benefits, ensuring that being in work pays more.</p>



<p>Speaking in the House of Commons on 27th October, I wholeheartedly welcomed the Autumn Budget and Spending Review. I believe it to be a hugely powerful budget that sets our country and economy in the right direction. It shows a welcome improvement in the public finances and delivers on many of the priorities of Amber Valley residents.</p>



<p>You can find the Chancellor&#8217;s statement in full <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents">here</a>, and my speech in the House following it <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-27a.288.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g340.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Covid-19 and Vaccination Update</u></strong></p>



<p>558 Positive cases have been confirmed in Amber Valley over the last 7 days, that’s 433 cases per 100,000 people. This remains below the national average for England, which currently stands at 484 cases per 100,000 people.o</p>



<p>The number of people testing positive for coronavirus in Amber Valley has been fluctuating since restrictions in England were lifted on 19<sup>th</sup> July, and as predicted, case rates began to increase considerably as we moved through autumn into the colder months. This led to some of the highest case rates we have seen in our constituency, with 157 people testing positive on the 4<sup>th</sup> October. However, despite some projections that case rates would continue to rise, they have actually been falling consistently throughout this month, so that the 7 day average for positive cases currently sits at 79.</p>



<p>Compared to last winter, hospitalisations relating to coronavirus continue to remain well below what we would expect, given the relatively high prevalence of the virus in the community. It is clear for the time being, that while health services in Amber Valley remain under some strain, owing in no small part to the unprecedented backlog in treatments, the risk of it being overwhelmed remains low. It is for this reason, therefore, that I do not support the introduction of so-called “plan-b” coronavirus restrictions at this time.</p>



<p>Our first line of defence against this virus continues to be our exemplary vaccination rollout, a terrific local and national effort. With everyone over the age of 50 being offered a booster jab, I urge anyone who is eligible to come forward and get jabbed. To protect themselves, our community, and our local health services.</p>



<p>As with the first doses of the vaccine, when you are eligible you should be notified by text, letter, or by your GP to arrange a booking. However, if you think you are eligible but have not been notified you can book the booster by calling 119 or online via the NHS website: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/book-or-manage-a-booster-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/book-or-manage-a-booster-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/</a></p>



<p><strong><u>Breast Milk Hub opening &#8211; Langley Mill</u></strong></p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was honoured to open Lauren’s Milk Hub in Langley Mill. This new Hub will help provide donor human breast milk that can then be transported to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) at hospitals across the East Midlands. It is an excellent addition to our local health networks as it will allow more sick and premature babies in the region to receive safe, screened donor milk.</p>



<p><strong><u>Support for Local Pubs</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 20<sup>th</sup> October I met with Emma McClarkin, Head of the British Beer and Pub Association, to sign a petition calling on the Government to lower draught beer duty ahead of the autumn budget. I am delighted that upon release of the budget, the Chancellor announced that tax on draught beer and cider will indeed be cut by 5%. The duty cut will bring down the cost of a pint by 3p, or as much as 25p for beer below 3.5% ABV.</p>



<p>The local pub is at the heart of many of our communities in Amber Valley, and is vital for creating jobs, boosting the local economy, and combatting loneliness and social isolation. In our constituency alone, pubs support 1,103 jobs and contribute £25m per year to the local economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an especially difficult time for pubs, and local owners and staff have made clear to me how precarious the past 2 years have been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, I am very pleased that the Government has continued to demonstrate its firm commitment to this most vital industry. With the lower duty on draught beer set to help our locals in Amber Valley thrive.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have recently been in contact with me to raise concerns about access to GP appointments following the pandemic. I&#8217;m very grateful for the work of our GPs, and all our NHS, throughout Covid-19 and always, and so I raised this issue in the House with the Secretary of State during Health &amp; Social Care Questions to see how we can support both GPs and constituents. I welcome the recent announcement of a £250 million winter access fund for GPs as a positive step, and I will continue to follow this closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Investment in the East Midlands</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament on the 26<sup>th</sup> of this month, I urged the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, to make progress on devolution and additional investment in the&nbsp;East Midlands. Our region has looked with some deserved envy at neighbouring regions that have elected mayors and have successfully attracted more investment.</p>



<p>It is my firm belief that the East Midlands would benefit greatly from an elected mayor to represent the region on the national stage. However, in the meantime I also reminded the Secretary of State that Derbyshire stands ready for a county deal of investment and would appreciate being a pathfinder for this scheme. You can see my question and the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-25a.8.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g8.1">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Preet discusses the impact of climate change on women and girls with the Women’s Institute  </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-discusses-impact-climate-change-women-and-girls-women%E2%80%99s-institute" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">

        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Ahead of COP26, local MP Preet Kaur Gill who serves as shadow secretary for international development, met with the local Harborne Village branch from the Women’s Institute (WI) to discuss the impact that climate change is having on the lives of women and girls across the world.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston, Birmingham said, “We have seen that time and again, women and girls are bearing the brunt of the climate change crisis, and this is exactly what is at stake for COP26. The Government is running out of time to make the summit a success, but it’s not too late. It is vital for everyone that the Prime Minister steps up and get the agreements with nations around the world to commit to the cause of climate crisis.” </p>
<p>The impact of climate change is not affecting people equally. Women and girls are being displaced from their communities, are facing gender violence and are being forced to drop out of education all due to climate-related disasters. Child marriage is used by families to cope with economic hardships caused by climate change. This puts millions of girls at risk of sexual and physical abuse, early pregnancy and maternal death. </p>
<p>Preet continued, “Climate change cannot be tackled in isolation that is why it was fantastic to be able to discuss this with local WI groups. We all need to play our part and it was an honour to see the action being taken by local residents.” </p>
<p>At the meeting, WI members from Harborne Village presented Preet with ‘no more loopholes’ bracelets. </p>
<p>Lynda Gibbon, WI member from Harborne Village explained, “It was fantastic to be able to discuss the issue with Preet and pass on these bracelets. A common criticism of climate conferences is that they ‘manufacture loopholes’, delivering agreements which allow national Governments worldwide to avoid fully implementing high-ambition climate agreements or emissions reductions.  </p>
<p>“As COP26 hosts, the UK Government has a responsibility to make sure that all climate agreements produced at COP26 are without these loopholes, delivering a greener, cleaner and healthier future for everyone, especially those that are the most climate vulnerable.  </p>
<p>“These bracelets form a physical representation of this situation – crochet is formed by creating a series of loops using a hook.” </p>

    <title>The Budget 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/the-budget-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out on behalf of the Government a budget that seeks to look to a more optimistic future as we move beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst we have endured challenging times, the budget prepares a new economy with higher wages, higher skills and rising productivity which will deliver for all the residents of Aldridge-Brownhills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ability to be able to successfully fight the Covid-19 pandemic was due to the enormous effort of our precious National Health Service. It was therefore extremely welcome news that there would be further investment in our NHS with a commitment to 40 new hospitals and the recruitment of 50,000 new nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget once again reaffirmed our commitment to hard working families with a 6.6% increase in the National Living Wage equivalent of £1,000, and a tax cut for families on Universal Credit putting more money back in their pockets. Recognising the squeeze that so many families are feeling due to the increase in fuel prices the Chancellor scrapped the anticipated rise in fuel duty, saving families’ money at the pumps will be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government’s priority as we move beyond the global pandemic is an ambitious programme of frontline investment to level up right across our country to close the gap between London and regions like ours. As independent commentators have observed our economy is fundamentally strong and whilst Covid-19 has had an impact on our economy, the Government stands on the side of families and businesses to support our precious public services and business community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public services are the People’s Priorities and at the heart of the budget was support for young people with an investment of over £500 million in youth services, 30,000 new school places for Special Educational Needs, a further £3 billion to help all pupils as part of the Covid-19 education recovery fund and a £4.7 billion of funding for education meaning per pupil funding will rise on average to £1,500 per pupil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sustained investment to deliver on key infrastructure projects, research and development and a commitment to greater productivity across the economy we will deliver on our ambition for Britain to be a global leader. With record investment in new transport projects the West Midlands Mayor Andy Street will receive more than £1billion for new transportation projects across our region to help level up our local areas and extend our economic reach. At the same time the new funding also represents a major step forward to realise my long held ambition to reopen a railway station in Aldridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commitment to build 180,000 new affordable new homes with a £1.8 billion investment in brownfield development means we will get the homes we need in the right places. It will also mean that we can protect our precious Green Belt and truly live up to our ambition of a ‘Brownfield First’ approach to development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This additional funding will be extremely important to all of us in Aldridge-Brownhills as we continue to work with Mayor Andy Street to stop speculative and unsuitable development on our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting businesses and High Streets is a key part of our economic recovery and I was pleased the Chancellor announced the long awaited review of Business Rates. I was also pleased that next year’s planned increases in Business Rates have been halted and that our Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Sector will receive a 50% discount, helping our High Streets and Village Centres through challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Government we are focussed on ensuring that we have Higher Skills, Higher Productivity and Higher Wages focussing on the ‘People’s Priorities’. The Budget represents our commitment to level up right across the whole United Kingdom delivering on our promises to the British people and all of the hard working families of Aldridge-Brownhills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Opened in 2013, the facility operates 24/7, 364 days a year, delivering brands such as Cravendale to stores around the country, to retailers like Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s. The centre employs a team of 500 people, 60% of which are Welwyn Hatfield residents.</p>
<p>Prior to the tour of the distribution centre, Mr Shapps sat down with Ash Amirahmadi- Managing Director of Arla Foods UK- and other members of the local team to discuss the challenges and pressures facing the company, and food distribution more widely, during the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>At the centre of discussions was the HGV driver shortage. At Arla, HGV salaries have been going up to meet demand for drivers- with annual salaries of £50,000-£70,000 depending on shift pattern.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of Arla Foods said: “We were delighted to welcome Grant Shapps to Arla Hatfield. We had a very constructive and positive discussion about our cooperative and the wider dairy sector with him, both as our local MP and as the Transport Secretary. We look forward to continuing to work closely together in the future.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s been really great to come to Arla, and hear first hand how businesses with a presence in my own constituency have been reacting to the international HGV driver shortage, as well as how the company has adapted to doing business post-covid.</p>
<p>“I commend Arla for their commitment to improving pay and conditions for HGV drivers. Increases in pay, starting a driving academy to train new drivers, as well as a programme to rehabilitate former prisoners to drive lorries and improvements to their facilities- all of these things will help make driving an HGV a more attractive career choice for those looking to get into the industry. Our plan seems to be working, with 1,000 provisional HGV licenses being applied for each day- that’s 3 times higher than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As Transport Secretary, I’ve put together a list of 25 separate measures to help ease the pressure on businesses like Arla- including increasing driving test capacity at the DVSA to clear the covid backlog, making those tests faster by stream-lining them and getting the army in to take on some of the strain in the short-term.</p>
<p>“These measures, combined with the hard work of the food distributors I’ve met today, will keep our supplies stocked as the global economy gets back up and running.”</p></div>

    <title>A government in chaos, a country in crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/a-government-in-chaos-a-country-in-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Judith&amp;#8217;s latest op-ed for the Telegraph &amp;amp; Argus Weds 13 October 2021:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With winter almost upon us, we see the Government of our country in chaos and our country teetering on the brink of crisis with queues at the forecourts; empty shelves and energy prices skyrocketing. A basic principle of government is to insulate the country from external shocks, but a lack of planning, a Prime Minister seemingly absent from duty and soaking up the Marbella sun and cabinet ministers squabbling is in fact risking turning crises into disasters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past week we’ve seen denials from the Treasury that the claims of the Secretary of State for Business, Kwasi Kwarteng MP, that he is speaking to the Chancellor about urgent support for firms struggling with fast-rising energy prices are untrue – who are we meant to believe? But more importantly, the question I ask is why the Chancellor and the Business Secretary are not talking to each other to avert a fast-approaching crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crisis where millions of families are set to be squeezed by a triple whammy of rising energy prices, an increase in national insurance, and the cut to Universal Credit. This will be felt by families not only in my Bradford South constituency and the wider Bradford District, but right across the country. Recent statistics show that the decisions of the Government will leave the average working family over £1700 worse off by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government must change course and protect working families whilst they still have the chance. By cancelling&amp;nbsp;the Universal Credit cut, dropping the tax rises on working people and businesses, and urgently exploring further measures to help households alleviate the cost of rising bills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning now to Northern Powerhouse Rail, reports are rife that the government is expected to block the inclusion of Bradford on the route in a bid to save money. Whilst for the current government spending money on Transport infrastructure in the South East is seen as an investment it appears that once again, spending money in the North is non-existent. This is just not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s time for the Prime Minister to put his money where his mouth is and deliver action on his levelling-up agenda, starting with a Bradford stop on the Northern Powerhouse rail route.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as delivering on improved infrastructure and opportunity for the North, the Prime Minister and his Government must work to urgently address backlogs in the DVLA. This coupled with the HGV driver shortage has left motorists struggling to fill up their cars and shops unable to fill the shelves to their usual capacity. Over the past few months, I’ve had many Bradford South constituents contact me to say that their license renewal has been pending for weeks; they are unable to contact the DVLA to progress or check the status of their application and some have even approached me to say that their employment is at risk because of DVLA delays. This cannot continue. We need the DVLA backlog to be resolved sooner rather than later. The government needs to get a grip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as issues with the DVLA, my mailbox has recently seen an increase in constituents contacting me who are struggling to get a face-to-face appointment with their GP. Whilst I and many others appreciate that for some people digital and remote consultations with their GP will be welcomed, it is imperative that face to face appointments continue to be commonplace and that all GP Practices are open and operational. Access to GP services is vital and I know that our GPs are trying their best in difficult circumstances, but they need better support from the Government to be able to triage and treat patients in way that works for all. That is why I have previously and will continue to raise access to GPs both locally with the Bradford District and Craven CCG and nationally with the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care to try and secure a better deal for both GPs and patients alike.  On a final note, next week parliament will return from the conference recess and there will be an important adjournment debate on Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) within Bradford. I’m clear that we need to reflect and learn lessons from the past and ensure that such acts cannot happen again. But I also feel just as strongly that we need to ensure that this debate looks at the ways in which agencies and individuals can all work together to make Bradford not only safer but the safest place in the country for children to grow up in. We’ve seen first-hand in our city what can happen when we don’t get this right, we cannot afford to let that happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16 Air Assault Brigade, the Army&amp;#8217;s airborne rapid reaction force, is now returning home to the UK.&lt;br&gt;I want to say a massive thank for their hard work to save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
