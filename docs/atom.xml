  <summary type="text">On the floor of the House of Commons last night, South Lakes MP Tim Farron made the case for people to stay vigilant over the Christmas period, saying it would be a 'tragedy' if it led to loved ones dying of COVID-19 just before they were able to be vaccinated from the virus.
It comes as the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal have joined forces this morning to call on the Government to reverse their decision to allow household mixing this Christmas, describing it as 'a major error that will cost many lives'.</summary>

<p>It comes as the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal have joined forces this morning to call on the Government to reverse their decision to allow household mixing this Christmas, describing it as 'a major error that will cost many lives'.</p>
<p>Speaking during a debate on COVID-19 in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"Here is the thing that concerns me: we are close, potentially, to seeing light at the end of the tunnel and we can almost sense people beginning not to dip for the tape but to just let their guard drop. On behalf of everyone in this Chamber and beyond, I just want to say that this is the moment for utmost vigilance.</em></p>
<p><em>"My dad was sharing that very thought with me the other day and he made the analogy with those tragic people who fell in the hours before the guns stopped on 11 November 1918. What a particular tragedy it was to be those who died at the end when the end was in sight.</em></p>
<p><em>"That is what we have ahead of us now, which is why if we need to tighten up restrictions over Christmas, miserable though that may be, we must think, for pity's sake, don't we want our loved ones to see summer? Aren't we prepared to make some restrictions now?"</em></p>
<p><em>"We know we are not going to have to live with this for years and years. We know that the light at the end of the tunnel is now visible. That is a glorious thing we can cling on to, but it is not an excuse - in fact it is the opposite of an excuse - to let our guard down."</em></p>

    <title>Energy paper launches consultations</title>

<p>We waited a long time for an energy policy. The energy paper released yesterday still leaves open how we will expand capacity to  allow for an industrial recovery and cut our dependence on imported electricity.</p>



<p>Whilst we read that new nuclear is a good answer in the press, what the paper says is</p>



<p>“No decision has yet been taken to proceed with Sizewell C” and the government  is working on ” creating an up to £385 million Advanced Nuclear fund to support the development of small modular reactors”</p>



<p>There is the suggestion the whole of this Parliament will be spent negotiating and planning a possible new nuclear power station with no guarantee it will be built. They also hope for modest grants to companies who might be able to commercialise smaller nuclear generation plants in due course. </p>



<p>The paper suggests a doubling of electricity capacity in total, but this seems to rely on the pledge already made to take offshore wind power up to 40GW. There is no satisfactory account of what the stand by or back up power will be, given the unreliability of wind power and the clear indication there might not be new nuclear after all. </p>



<p>The only  new policy which kicks in from 1 January 2021 is a UK Emissions trading system to replace the EU with the promise that it will be tougher, implying dearer power. </p>



<p>We need a greater sense of urgency and some investments soon to secure the extra capacity this country already  needs. We also need better policies for cheaper power for industry, in  order to win back lost market share in making and growing things. The affordability package is targetted on retail consumers alone. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In 2019 London City Airport undertook an extensive 16-week public consultation on their draft master plan which proposed airport expansion and a change to operating hours. The plans raised a number of concerns which ranged from increased noise pollution in flight path areas to issues of air quality. Jon Cruddas MP was contacted by many constituents during the consultation period and met with London City Airport to discuss their concerns.</p>
              <p><strong>At the time Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> “I just can’t see the justification for supporting airport expansion in London. Knowing what we do now about emissions and the goal to reach net-zero carbon in 11 years, airport expansion is at odds with the current social, economic and political direction of travel.”</p>
              <p>The results of the consultation have now been published in a new finalised master plan which can be found here: <em><strong><a href="https://www.londoncityairport.com/corporate/master-plan ">https://www.londoncityairport.com/corporate/master-plan </a></strong></em></p>
              <p>Recognising the concerns that were raised by those that took part in the consultation alongside key stakeholders, London City Airport have adapted the master plan to maintain current operating hours, including the existing eight-hour night-time flight curfew.</p>
              <p>City Airport have also expressed that they recognise growth must go hand in hand with the highest environmental standards which means they will now focus on providing capacity for up to 11 million passengers and 151,000 aircraft movements each year, by making best use of the existing runway.</p>
              <p><strong>Jon Cruddas said:</strong> “we need to get the right balance between supporting business, protecting the environment and meeting the climate change challenge by transitioning to net zero. The changes to London City Airport’s master plan is a victory for all those that questioned the negative impacts expansion could have on life in Dagenham and Rainham.”</p>
              <p><strong>A London City Airport representative said:</strong> “We remain very confident in the long-term prospects of London City Airport and our ability to return to growth and create more local jobs in the years to come. In the short term, we will focus on recovering from COVID-19, supporting our local communities and welcoming back passengers and airlines to London’s most central airport.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;Denton and Reddish MP, Andrew Gwynne, has reacted angrily to revised plans for the Bredbury Industrial Estate extension submitted today to Stockport Council by developer Quorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer has again proposed environmentally damaging industrial sheds deep into the Tame Valley on the border of Stockport and Tameside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking out, the Labour MP said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What part of leave, go away, you’re not welcome &amp;#8211; our shared Tame Valley is not for grabs, don’t they understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will not allow this environmental rape of our cherished narrow strip of green space separating Denton, Bredbury and Woodley at the River Tame. The Tame Valley is for recreation and nature, not HGVs, pollution and tin sheds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stockport might be out of the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework, but the planning sequential test still applies. The fact is there are other suitable sites to relocate displaced businesses from the Mayoral Development Corporation area in Stockport. In any case, there is nothing in the MDC area which requires such large-scale logistics premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Furthermore, there is an oversupply of sites for logistics warehousing in Greater Manchester. There is no justification for taking green belt land for this use at this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sooner Quorum understands there’s no fast buck to be made at Bredbury and that we will fight them all the way to save our Tame Valley from their grubby money grabbing mitts, the better. I reiterate: our Tame Valley is not up for grabs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Tameside Council, led by the Denton South Labour Councillors, had passed a motion opposing the development because of the destruction of the river valley, the negative impact it would have on the Haughton Dale and Hulmes Woods Local Nature Reserves, and on traffic and air quality in Denton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tameside’s motion was sent to Stockport Council as a formal objection and to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, asking for him to ‘call-in’ any decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People can object to the latest planning application by writing to Stockport Council at Planning Services, Place Directorate, Stopford House, Picadilly, Stockport SK1 3XE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;or online at &lt;a href="https://www.stockport.gov.uk/topic/planning"&gt;https://www.stockport.gov.uk/topic/planning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And quoting reference: DC/074399&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This complements the core funding for the project from the European Regional Development Fund, as well as earlier commitments from the Arts Council, Shropshire Council, and Ludlow Assembly Room’s own significant fundraising efforts, to transform the venue into a financially and environmentally sound flagship for the arts in South Shropshire. It follows an earlier grant of £97,250 from the Culture Recovery Fund in October. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: “I was really pleased to have been able to take a socially-distanced look at the works to transform Ludlow Assembly Rooms with the Trust chair Gareth Williams, volunteer Chief Executive Helen Hughes, and Shropshire Council Leader Peter Nutting.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This was on the day the Assembly Rooms received news of an additional £130,000 grant through the government’s Culture Recovery Fund, distributed by the Arts Council as part of a £600 million package to help arts organisations who have suffered delays in capital projects due to the COVID pandemic.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This funding will help get this major refurbishment project back on track, hopefully to open when performing arts events are able to return to normal next year. The Assembly Rooms are being transformed to maintain this important venue to sustain much of the cultural vibrancy available for Ludlow and wider South Shropshire area. I commend everyone involved who have been working so hard to make Ludlow Assembly Rooms sustainable for the future, and can’t wait to get back to watching performances there again next year.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Gareth Williams, Chair of Ludlow Assembly Rooms said: “Throughout our long period of closure for building works and then Coronavirus, we have stood by the community and Ludlow and by our hardworking staff.  This funding means we can look ahead with confidence to being able to reopen in the spring, even if we still have small amounts of money to raise to finish the task we have set ourselves.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Helen Hughes, Voluntary CEO of Ludlow Assembly Rooms said: “These last few months have been extraordinarily difficult for both the Trustees who manage the charity and for the staff, who have been unstinting in their support.  This funding will act as a springboard for the opening of this much loved facility for the whole community of Ludlow.”</span></span></span></p></div>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-37/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last Saturday I spent the day on the Wales Co-operative Council Zoom call meeting. As a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, I presented a report on the activities of the Parliamentary Co-operative Group over the past two months. We have been very active. We have drawn the attention to the need for free school meals during holiday periods in England, which are provided in Wales, and the UK Government eventually climbed down. International development and fair trade is a key co-operative value and we have called for this to be at the heart of any future trade deals. We opposed the merging of the Department for International Development into the FCO, and voiced our objection to the abolishment of the International Trade Select Committee. We have continued to campaign to give shop workers greater protection against violence and abuse they suffer at work. At our Co-operative Party Local Government Conference our Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds announced that we will be working together on a Labour and Co-operative Recovery Partnership, towards a Labour and Co-operative Government.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, as chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Vegetarians and Vegans, I hosted a virtual event about food security. The World Food Summit of 1996 defined food security as existing when “all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious, food to maintain a healthy, active life”. During the Coronavirus pandemic issues around access to food have become more widespread. With many people losing their jobs or being paid less, the number of people using food banks has increased. We heard from people in communities involved in helping people with restricted diets access suitable foods during this pandemic. Speakers included, a vegan food bank, The Vegetarian Society and V for Life. It was a pleasure to welcome Baroness Anita Gale, former General Secretary of Welsh Labour, and a lifelong vegetarian to become a member of the APPG.</p>
<p>On Monday evening I joined the <a href="https://ukabif.org.uk/news/542352/-UKABIF-participates-in-All-Party-Parliamentary-Group-Roundtable-on-COVID-19.htm">All Party Parliamentary Group for Acquired Brain Injury Roundtable</a> discussion on Covid-19 rehabilitation and neurological conditions. Speakers from the Neurological Alliance, Parkinson’s UK, MS Society, SUDEP Action, MND Association, Epilepsy Action, and the UK Acquired Brain Injury Forum discussed the impact of Covid-19 on people with neurological conditions and the need for increased access and provision of rehabilitation services during this pandemic and into the future.</p>
<p>The Sepsis APPG, of which I am the chair, works closely with the UK Sepsis Trust who are investigating the strong link between Sepsis and Long-Covid. Both of these conditions require rehabilitation services and should be joined with rehabilitation services for other high risk conditions such as those discussed in the Roundtable.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, as vice chair of the <a href="https://hs-8074033.t.hubspotstarter-h6.net/e2t/tc/VVY6FH7tvG03W27wqRj3K6B2HW2z6fd_4kswX2N2L_pzS3lGnpV1-WJV7CgVTZW4NK-f76vmxSKW8SctfR28RdzVW7146t11Dtp3xW1ZMNVL1-4l6hW2ZV9Pj5VGv4lW1W9jfK6s03fKV6tzPs5BYjxnVjQHrl4-K-vnVY4tNd3h34kCVmtfQL7y-BfZW3z2C1y8wnP3bW6VZbGm9bwfDQVD7pQx6BjTS4W5dG-1Q6fqt7dW48ybB668PbWnVJRbj_4sDWVsW1hDvWL4Sr3RXN5V2BpdF6xMNW7MD-n58kR72-VV9mZ64_5qShW5vXRsT4RmNrwW7Dc1q24VY64ZW6fBNqC4c48TnW40nffn24YKl2W4JqKkD8Bp8Z5W49wSDz91DLHr34qy1">APPG for Gaps in Support</a>, I joined its meeting addressed by Metro Mayors Dan Jarvis MP, Sheffield City Region, Steve Rotherham, Liverpool City Region, and Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester Region. They spoke about being in the highest COVID-19 restrictions in England, how this had affected the people and communities they represent and about their campaigns to secure funds from UK Government for those who had fallen through the gaps. This APPG probably has the largest membership in Parliament and represents the people and businesses who are excluded from UK Government support schemes.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening I joined the last ever Parliamentary Mindfulness session, virtually. Some eight years ago my dear friend Chris Ruane, former MP for Vale of Clwyd, teamed up with the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre and organised drop in sessions, courses and retreats for MPs, Peers and Parliamentary staff. The sessions were run by the Oxford Mindfulness Foundation, which is a charity for the research, teaching and education of mindfulness, focusing on well being and resilience. Unfortunately the funding has run out. Over the years, over 250 parliamentarians and 500 staff have taken part in these sessions and we will all miss the opportunity to come together and support each other trying to cope with the stress and challenges of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I joined the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group zoom meeting. The General Secretary of the Co-operative Party, Joe Fortune, and his Political and Parliamentary Officer, Rob Bates, gave us an update on plans for future activities and campaigns. We will continue to support Alex Norris MP’s Private Members Bill protecting shop workers from violence and abuse in work when it returns to be debated when Friday Sittings are resumed; amend forthcoming legislation; ask oral questions; and set down written questions to pursue co-operative values.</p>
<p>I was drawn on the Call List for the Westminster Hall debate “That this House has Considered support for people ineligible for UK Government COVID-19 Support Schemes” scheduled for 4:30pm, and was going to speak about the rigid, inflexible, criteria and rules attached to the UK Government support schemes which has resulted in 3 million people being excluded from support during this pandemic. And how the Chancellor has not corrected these gaps. Whereas the Welsh Government has plugged holes in the Chancellor’s schemes and created its own, so that businesses in Welsh communities continue to trade and workers spend locally, giving our high streets the best chance of surviving. However, I was summoned to chair in Westminster Hall from 4pm for the rest of the sitting, and did not therefore speak in the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/1d9ad65f-923b-47cb-946f-c463eb5e30ab">debate</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning I chaired the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/a9509d52-5d67-485d-bdbf-841ca78d526b">Fifteenth Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which considered two Statutory Instruments amending the Draft Health and Social Care Act 2008 in respect of Coronavirus regulations in England. The aim of both instruments is to establish consistent regulation for all providers in the rapidly expanding COVID-19 testing market and aim to make it quicker for new test providers to gain certification and start providing testing services. After discussions by members of the committee, both instruments were unanimously approved.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I chaired a <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28ba4159-070b-485a-8516-8f91fcaf990e">Westminster Hall debate</a> on UK – Qatar Relations led by Alistair Carmichael MP in which members discussed the merits of continuing this relationship for the benefit of the UK.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Artwork featuring the best entries to our Annual MP / MS Christmas Card Competition will be on display from tomorrow (Saturday, 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December) in the St Elli Shopping Centre adding some much-needed cheer to the town during the festive period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shoppers will be able to see eye-catching designs from
youngsters across the Llanelli constituency including from pupils from Ysgol
Llannon, Swiss Valley Primary, Ysgol Y Castell, Ysgol Gymunedol Bancffosfelen,
Burry Port Primary and Ysgol Y Felin.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of the exhibition will be the winning designs
from Mia Emoka of Ysgol Llannon who won the Infants category and Megan-Lily
Killick who picked up the prize for the best Junior entry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has been a pleasure to see that even after all the
upheaval of the last few months, so many children taking part in the
competition and submitting colourful and optimistic entries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2020 has been a tough year for many people but we hope that the display will bring a little bit of extra happiness to Llanelli not only to those whose work will feature on it but also to anyone who takes the time to pop along and appreciate the wonderful work of our local young people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, has welcomed today’s news that Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital in Cottingham, is to benefit from £5,925,000.</p>
<p>The funding comes from a pot of £600 million, which is earmarked to tackle critical maintenance work at 178 NHS Trusts across England. This work could include building new or refurbishing buildings, installing brand-new electrics, upgrading ventilations systems, improving fire safety or replacing aging lifts.</p>
<p>In all, the local NHS Trust will spend the new cash on 11 different projects, with all work due to be completed by March 2021 so that hospital staff, patients and visitors will see immediate improvements.</p>
<p>The £600 million comes itself from a £1.5 billion pledge made by Boris Johnson back in June, with the rest of the funding going towards modernising mental health facilities and expanding A&amp;E capacity by expanding waiting areas and increasing the number of treatment cubicles, as well as improving infection control ahead of winter.</p>
<p>Hull hospitals had previously benefited from £4,297,000 of this capacity-building and infection control funding back in August.</p>
<p>Graham said, “The Government has pledged to give more funding to our NHS, so I’m very pleased to see that it is following through on these promises – especially at such a crucial time.</p>
<p>“The tough restrictions during November have succeeded in bringing the coronavirus ‘R’ rate down, the rate at which it spreads, but we still have to be extra careful at a time when the NHS also experiences its usual winter pressures. That’s why our unprecedented flu and Covid-19 vaccine rollouts are so important – to prevent the most vulnerable from falling ill.</p>
<p>“This funding is great news, coming as it does on top of billions of pounds for dozens of new hospitals by 2030 and tens of thousands more nurses and doctors by 2025.”</p>
<p>Castle Hill Hospital was recently confirmed as one of the country’s 50-odd Covid-19 vaccination hubs, meaning that eligible people in the East Riding and Hull will be able to benefit from local access to the UK’s largest programme of immunisation in its history.</p>
<p>The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, added: “These crucial maintenance projects will deliver immediate benefits and provide NHS staff with the facilities they need to provide world-class care to their patients this winter, helping ensure the NHS is always there for you when you need it.”</p>
<p>The Government has also confirmed that the Yorkshire Ambulance Service is set to benefit from £148,000 funding to carry out maintenance.</p>

    <title>Harsh reality of Brexit is on the horizon, says Isles MP Angus MacNeil</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2020/12/09/harsh-reality-of-brexit-is-on-the-horizon-says-isles-mp-angus-macneil/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The concerned countdown to Brexit is on, states Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil who says we must brace ourselves for the major impacts this will have on day to day life and the economy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People must also understand that neither Deal or No Deal is a good option and puts the UK in a worse trading position than any major European nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking ahead of crunch meetings between UK PM Boris Johnson’s final round of talks with President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, Mr MacNeil says he is pessimistic for what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has had talks with many bodies across industries in his capacity as Chair of the International Trade Committee of the House of Commons and none have outlined the benefits of Brexit, whether the outcome is Deal or No Deal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “I have had many conversations about Brexit over the last couple of years, they have got worse and more intensely concerning as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Industries are actually complaining that the UK Government is not listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many people will have heard the news that Honda have stopped manufacturing due to a lack of parts. This is no major surprise, manufacturing in the UK is going to be severely impacted by Brexit, especially just in time manufacturing relying on truckloads of components daily arriving at factories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haulage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most pivotal news comes from the Road Haulage Association who have an overview of traffic coming in and out of the UK and I think it is worth repeating some of things they have told me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“85% of haulage to the UK is from EU lorries, 35% of those are Polish, 16% Spanish, with Slovak and Lithuanian being the next biggest groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These carriers are paid by the kilometre; they have debt on tractor units, so they need to keep moving to be earning. Clearly with border friction and talk of tailbacks of up to 70 miles with two days to be cleared &amp;#8211; in a worst-case scenario &amp;#8211; does not make the UK an attractive destination for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“The Road Haulage Association estimates that traffic between this part of Europe across the English Channel to continent of Europe will be between 65 and 85% if there is a deal and between 40 and 65% if there is no deal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that there is plenty of work for these lorries across Europe so to pay the debts on lorries, they don’t need to be parked up in Calais or Dover and not earning money. This is one of the likely coming harsh realities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poultry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Speaking to the British Poultry Council – deal or no deal, the price of chicken is going up. It will go up 5% in the case of a deal or 25% if No Deal as they find cost inputs rising as they lose part of their Euro markets for some of the meat that would have been sold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Animal medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“81% of animal medicines come from EU, this is a concern for sheep producers. That was been brought to my attention by those in animal veterinary services. This could become problem in the New Year as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Tariffs may or may not be there depending if there is Deal or No Deal, but there will certainly be border friction, due to the many non-tariff barriers. The UK will be about the only sizable country in Europe outside both the Customs Union and Single Market.&amp;nbsp; Even traditional outliers of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland being in the Single Market will have more developed relationships with the EU than the UK, this is clearly going to impact trade.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cost of pallets is also going up, transportation of goods which have to be heat treated for travel at certain temperatures and their cost may double per wooden pallet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving permit and insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For those who wish to travel to EU they will need an international driving licence, an international driving permit which is available at Post Office’s because the UK driving licence will no longer be acceptable in the EU anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Drivers may also need a “Green Card” to show car insurance abroad is valid if they are taking their own car abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Passports will need at least 6 months validity. It is EU law for the Schengen passport area, coming in from outside the EU, you need 6 months validity. This will be the case for deal or no deal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“European Health Insurance card is not valid from January 1 and travellers will need to have their own travel insurance and make sure it includes coverage for pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “Essentially the easy right to free movement is gone and its evaporation is creating a lot of difficulties, a lot of form filling, a lot of costs are all going to be in the way and this is all thanks to the stupidity of Brexit hidden by the misinformation of leading Brexiteers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“I did note also in the news in the last few days, one of the leading Brexiteer voices, Jim Radcliffe, Chief Executive of INEOS, who is developing an off road vehicle, unbelievably he has chosen to construct it in France which is in the EU, as opposed to constructing in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“It just about sums up the crazy situation the UK finds itself in now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The best advice would be to abandon Brexit at this stage but unfortunately that doesn’t look to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now more than ever it makes sense for Scotland to be a normal independent nation, we in Scotland voted against this crazy choice but the expected worst impacted area in all of the UK and Europe from Brexit will be the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In short, food prices are going up, haulage is more difficult and general everyday hassles will be increasing.”&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&amp;nbsp;UK&amp;nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video was produced during the visit, which can be viewed below:&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s get behind all our fantastic small businesses</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/lets-to-get-behind-our-fantastic-local-small-businesses/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=lets-to-get-behind-our-fantastic-local-small-businesses" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This has been an unprecedented year, and the effects of the pandemic have undoubtedly hit small businesses hard. That’s why I’m pledging to buy over 50% of my Christmas shopping from local businesses this year, and I want to encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Across the Highlands, over 90 per cent of registered businesses are small businesses, and whilst online purchases from large retailers have now become a way of life, I am asking people to consider a couple of simple strategies to help out locally. Could you find a Highland supplier to deliver to you, could you support a local venue, hotel or restaurant and buy a voucher, or could you give the gift of giving by donating to a local charity or group, in their name.</p>
<p>My team and I have pulled together a list of our favourite small businesses from across the constituency, and would like to encourage you to shop with them, and the many other small businesses this festive season:</p>

<p><strong>Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</strong></p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is encouraging all constituents to put safety first when shopping online for their Christmas presents this year.</p>
<p>With online marketplaces not bound by the same laws as traditional retailers, fake and dangerous electrical products are being sold to unknowing customers. Containing sub-standard or counterfeit parts, they present a serious risk of fire or electric shock.  In research conducted by Electrical Safety First, 14 out of 15 sampled products from third-party sellers failed basic safety tests.</p>
<p>Electrical Safety First are encouraging consumers to make sure you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller, to check packaging and the item carefully for tell-tale signs that the product is not genuine, and to check for safety certifications on labelling.</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth said: </strong></p>
<p>“With Covid restrictions still affecting everyday life, many constituents will be doing their Christmas shopping online this year.</p>
<p>“If you are planning on buying electrical goods please make sure that you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller. Avoid third-party sellers for electrical goods and if you are unsure at all when your product arrives, do not use it.</p>
<p>“I know it’s been a tough year and finances are tight, but it’s not worth risking fire and electrocution to save a few pounds”.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/12/04/bristol-south-mp-warns-constituents-about-electrical-safety-in-the-run-up-to-christmas/" target="_blank">Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Challenging the Prime Minister during PMQs</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Yesterday (Wed 2<sup>nd</sup> Dec) I was lucky enough to be drawn to ask a question during Prime Minister’s Question Time.</p>



<p>Seeing as it’s almost twelve months since Boris Johnson took the mantle of Prime Minister, I thought I’d remind him of this anniversary and challenge him on his record.</p>



<p>Just some of the ‘highlights’ of the Prime Minister’s tenure that I chose to remind him of were; 71,000 Covid-19 deaths, which tragically is the highest rate in Europe. We have seen our national debt balloon to two trillion pounds for first time ever, meaning we are now officially the worst performing economy in the G7. With just weeks to go, our Brexit negotiations are failing, and we face leaving the EU without a deal which would spell disaster for jobs and businesses. Finally, during the pandemic, the Government have given at least £1.5 billion of taxpayer’s money in contracts to Tory friends and donors and at the same time whipped his MPs to vote against feeding hungry children free school meals. It’s a record that any decent person should be ashamed of however, I asked the Prime Minister which of these achievements he was most proud of.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly the Prime Minister failed to answer my question, avoiding defending himself he dithered and blustered his was and attempted to criticise the Labour Party. During my time as an MP I have sat opposite three different Prime Ministers and whilst none have left with records to be proud of, we really have sunk to a new low with Boris Johnson.</p>

<p><strong>Question by John to the Chancellor and Minister for the Cabinet Office:</strong></p>



<p>With reference to the National Audit Office report on Government procurement during the covid-19 pandemic, published 18 November 2020, [I would like to ask] whether the same standard of due diligence checks was carried out on potential suppliers and contracts in the (a) high priority lane and (b) normal lane.</p>



<p><strong>Answer from Ministers:</strong></p>



<p>Being able to procure at speed has been critical in providing the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>We welcome the NAO report which recognises that the government ‘needed to procure with extreme urgency’ and ‘secured unprecedented volumes of essential supplies necessary to protect front-line workers’.</p>



<p>All contracts, including those designed to tackle coronavirus issues, must continue to achieve value for money for taxpayers, use good commercial judgement and the details of any awards made should be published as soon as possible in line with Government transparency guidelines.</p>



<p>Robust processes are in place for the award of government contracts. PPE offers were assessed using the same eight step process, including quality checks, price controls and other due diligence, no matter where the original referral came from. This eight step process has been published in the NAO’s report. For further details please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-government-procurement-following-this-weeks-nao-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on gov.uk.(opens in a new tab)</a></p>



<p>We are committed to transparency in public procurement. Details of central government contracts above £10,000 are published on Contracts Finder. We regret that some details have not been uploaded in a timely fashion. All will be published as soon as possible and significant information is already available online.</p>



<p>The forthcoming Green Paper on transforming the UK’s public procurement regulations will strengthen our longstanding and essential policies that are fundamental to public procurement including transparency, ensuring value for money and fair treatment of suppliers. As part of this, we will propose legislating to reinforce that contracting authorities would need to publish basic disclosure information, including the basis of award decisions.</p>



<p>We have always accepted that there are lessons to be learned from how we responded to this unprecedented global pandemic and the government is fully committed to doing so. We will address the NAO report’s recommendations in due course. As I stated in my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-11-12/debates/46D252DF-18D4-40EE-9AD5-0439F9106839/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-ED32E98C-15B1-4BEF-A267-47FB68033CDF" target="_blank">answer on 12 November (opens in a new tab)</a>, we are engaged in both internal and external audit to review how our procurements during this period have been conducted.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-heading-link-color-mariner-color">Responding to the answer from Government, John wrote on social media: &#8220;Got answers to my Questions on Government covid contracts. Good that all suppliers faced same quality checks no matter who recommended them, but publication backlog of contract details still needs fixing. Big post-brexit opportunity for faster, more digital &amp; transparent, less bureaucratic Government buying process so small firms can challenge big incumbents easily!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

    <title>Covid-19 Tier Restrictions</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2020/12/02/covid-19-tier-restrictions/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yesterday (01/12/20), Parliament was presented with a simple, for or against, choice to vote on the renewed ‘Tier’ restrictions which have subsequently come into place this morning and the additional financial support package on offer to businesses, workers and households across Gateshead and the North East.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I wanted to take some time to explain my position on this matter and why I voted against the imposition of this package yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>At the outset, I absolutely agree with experts here in Gateshead and Nationally that we must prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout our communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>I also agree that the best way to do this is through limiting social interaction especially among meetings of multiple households.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The package of restrictions are not perfect, they appear to be ever more complicated and the allocation of tiers to different regions appears to be unequal at first glance, with areas in the North and North East subjected to greater levels of restrictions compared to other parts of the UK with similar or higher rates of incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>To this end, I have formally requested the Government publish the criteria used and set out some clarity on how regions will move between tiers while we await the rollout of a number of vaccine programmes.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The restrictions in place since the spring, closing large numbers of businesses across Gateshead and limiting the trade of so many others, have had an incredibly damaging impact on the lives and livelihoods and overall wellbeing of so many people.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government has a duty and the means to provide proper financial support to these businesses and their employees, and to this end, I firmly believe they have failed. While the initial business rate grant scheme and the furlough scheme seemed generous, many millions of people have been left without any support whatsoever and continue to be ignored 9 months on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>In addition, businesses in Gateshead which have either had to remain closed or have been once again forced to close – hospitality, fitness suites and retail particularly – alongside many self employed workers; have been left with meagre amounts of support, if any, as many businesses enter what would traditionally be their busiest trading period.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government appear to have prioritised funnelling billions of pounds of tax payer money into, sometimes selective, elements of the private sector to provide inadequate PPE and an ineffective test, track and trace system. Instead, they should be prioritising financial support for businesses, employees and families affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Failure to do so has not only had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of so many people, but it has had a detrimental impact on adherence to the restrictions. The Government must understand that many people can not work from home and do not have ready access to utilities and food, and many can not afford to withstand repeated periods of self isolation without proper financial support – Statutory Sick Pay is simply totally inadequate.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Notwithstanding the urgent need to restrict the spread of Covid-19, I voted against the motion yesterday evening, as I firmly believe the Government can and must do more to provide adequate financial support for every person and business affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have raised the inadequate financial support with the Government since the spring and will continue to do so until they meet their responsibility in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Now that the North East is officially subject to tier 3 restrictions, I would urge all residents to follow the rules closely, as this is the only way we can reduce the spread of the virus enough to move down the tier system. With our infection rates declining, because of everyone’s efforts and with positive news of vaccinations in the very near future, it is imperative that we all do whatever we can to further drive down the spread of Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I hope this sets out my view clearly, however, if you have any further questions please do contact my office.</span></p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

        <p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/2020/11/26/amber-valley-derbyshire-tier-update-from-the-2nd-december-2020/"><![CDATA[<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

    <title>Letter from Cllr David Mellen to the PM on COVID Tiers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2020/11/25/letter-from-cllr-david-mellen-to-the-pm-on-covid-tiers/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;Cllr David Mellen&lt;br&gt;Leader, Nottingham City Council&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;I am writing to you with a further update about the coronavirus crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;Firstly, I am expecting details of what arrangements will follow the current lockdown next week. I will provide you with an update as soon as I get them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;For your information, the latest statistics for Surrey and for our area are &lt;a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/244872/Surrey_covid-19_infographic_2011.pdf"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;You will see that Epsom and Ewell and Reigate and Banstead have been rising in the past few days while Mole Valley has declined. But these figures have been moving up and down fairly rapidly as there are still only a relatively small number of people with the virus locally and so a small change can move the overall statistics significantly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;I have been asked to remind people who use grandparents for childcare that this is permitted to continue during the current lockdown. Details of the rules are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;This also applies to friends who provide childcare for each other. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;Please do save your Christmas shopping for the period after the lockdown and spend as much as you can locally. All of our local shops need your help when they reopen. Unless you are buying Christmas wine – you can do that now as the wine shops are open. I’ve done that bit already! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;Epsom Rotary Competitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;Epsom Rotary tell me that they are doing two competitions for the festive season. Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/homepage.php?ClubID=874"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;details&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;I will be back in touch next week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;With best wishes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>As we approach the halfway point of the Government’s nationwide lockdown, I want to thank constituents and businesses for abiding by the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The Government has lost control of the virus, and my first duty is to keep my constituents safe. That is why I voted for the lockdown. Nobody voted for the regulations with anything but a heavy heart. I did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>This period must be used to undertake the transfer of test and trace to local public health departments, including a full resource transfer. In addition, the Government must ensure that the NHS and social care are fully prepared with adequate PPE, as high as possible uptake of flu vaccinations and regular testing regimes.</p>
<p>I have proposed measures to protect the clinically vulnerable and providing ‘supportive shielding’ so that people don’t experience the devastating isolation that happened last time. We must also make sure we have simple, coherent messaging with local community engagement as well as monitoring and enforcement capacity to support people complying during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Local restrictions have had a devastating effect on people living in care homes and their families.  As co-Chair of the APPG on Dementia I have received heart-breaking stories from Oldhamers, unable to visit their loved ones for months on end, and who have seen a marked deterioration in their condition, particularly for those living with dementia.</p>
<p>I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the impact of coronavirus on people living with dementia, their families and carers last week, where I challenged the Minister on these issues. I pressed the Minister to report back to Parliament on her trial of visitor testing which starts on 16<sup>th</sup> November in 30 care homes, with the intention of rolling out testing for visitors across the country in December.  It is essential that family members are able to safely visit their loved ones in care homes, especially as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>I have also been challenging the Government on how they’ve been awarding Covid-related contracts. Billions of pounds of public money has been awarded to private companies often with no experience in delivering medical supplies. The Government’s repeated refusal to come clean about where this public money has left no option but to compel the Government to come clean through the courts. This is why I partnered with Caroline Lucas MP, Layla Moran MP and the Good Law Project in legal action to force the Government to publish details of private covid and PPE related contracts.</p>
<p>Whilst we recognise that at the beginning of the pandemic we needed to move quickly, this does not justify the Government’s wholesale disregard for transparency including the publication of contracts awarded. The Government has now disclosed that at least £17 billion worth of Covid-19 contracts have been awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care since April, with over £4 billion of these contracts being hidden. The transparency gap is therefore growing.</p>
<p>I am pleased that last week the High Court granted our judicial review to challenge the Government’s persistent failure to publish these contracts. The hearing is scheduled for mid-January 2021 and I’ll keep you informed of our progress.</p>
<p>Do look after yourselves and stay safe.</p>

    <title>Judith tells Government ‘the people of the north will hold you to account’ on rebalancing the economy.</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I took part in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DanJarvisMP&lt;/a&gt; debate on support for the economy in the North. We need a fundamental rebalancing of our economy after Covid. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this Government to account for their promises and their actions. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCcp6jNBhp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCcp6jNBhp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judith Cummins (@JudithCummins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudithCummins/status/1326541226452004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>
