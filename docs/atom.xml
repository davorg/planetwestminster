<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus B MacNeil yesterday participated in a Westminster cross-party debate on the impact that the EU exit deal is having on the fishing industry.</p>



<p>Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:</p>

<p>“The difficulties faced by the Scottish fishing industry because of the Brexit deal continue to hit our fishing industry and I was glad to have had the opportunity to participate in this debate.</p>



<p>“I highlighted the deal Norway currently has, a deal which has a detrimental impact on the fishing industry. The UK government has given the Norwegians the greater part of our market overnight and achieved nothing in return for fishermen.</p>



<p>“I also highlighted the delay with the £100 million scheme that was promised by the UK Government in January, nearly seven months later, fishermen are still waiting. The UK Government needs to move quickly and deliver on their promise to help our fishing industry which is caught up in bureaucracy as a result of the Brexit deal.</p>



<p>“Prior to Brexit, three-quarters of Scottish fishermen’s exports went to the European Union, but there has been an almost exponential rise in costs. As an example, Barratlantic, a local fish factory in my constituency, tell me that where a delivery note used to suffice, it now needs a catch certificate, packing lists and commodity codes, scientific names on consignments, a commercial invoice and an import and export declaration form, a staggering eight pieces of paper before it starts exporting. In addition, this fish factory pays the French Government VAT at 5.5%, and it also needs a health certificate.</p>



<p>“Export costs to get a product to the continent has trebled from 32p per kilo to around £1 a kilo. Whereas consignments could be sent in three to four pallets, they now have to be sent in pallet loads of 10 to make matters viable and economical, this affects the bottom line of many businesses.</p>



<p>“The Government really have to look quickly at ways of streamlining exports and along with Luke Pollard MP and Alistair Carmichael MP, I have been in touch with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on several occasions to try to get these matters streamlined so that multiple data entries and paperwork are not required. Some things could and should be digitised to enable the transfer of data from one place to the other without the onerous time.”</p>

    <title>My speech during the debate on English Votes for English Laws</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/07/14/my-speech-during-the-debate-on-english-votes-for-english-laws/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>England deserves better. England expects better. It is a sad occasion that this Government should wish to dismiss the only modest devolution ever offered to England, with nothing to put in its place. They leave instead Labour’s lopsided and unfair devolution, a devolution proposed and forced through a previous Parliament, on a large majority, by a Labour party that said it would settle the constitution and unite the country behind the Union once and for all. It did nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Surely this Government can now see that if they carry on, as Labour did, appeasing the forces that would pull the Union asunder, they will not bring the Union together but give those forces greater strength and a better platform. Instead of Scottish electors welcoming their devolved powers and deciding to continue in the traditional mould of two United Kingdom parties contesting power, they chose a party that wishes to pull the Union apart. Some of them chose that party because they thought the Government would give in to it, and so get a better deal for Scotland; and some of them chose that party because they genuinely wanted to pull the Union apart, although they were, of course, in a minority.</p>
<p>The Government and I treasure our United Kingdom. We wish this Union to work for everyone, but it has to be a fair Union. It will not be held together better by appeasing the SNP or by appeasing the EU over Northern Ireland. We above all in this House should be speaking up for all the millions of Unionists in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and throughout England and Wales, who expect better and expect fairness.</p>
<p>One of the crucial values that our United Kingdom shares is that idea of fairness. How is it fair to have these totally different categories of MP, with different powers, different responsibilities and different opportunities to influence how they are governed in their parts of the United Kingdom? Why is it that England, the home of many more millions of Unionists and more loyal to our country than anyone else in our Union, is the one part of the Union that gets no justice and no fairness from this Government or their predecessors?</p>
<p>Labour introduced policies that sought to break the Union in the name of keeping the Union. I want this Government to mend the Union, and that means standing behind all those people throughout the United Kingdom who believe in the Union, and to stop appeasing those who would pull it apart.</p>

&lt;p&gt;The Minister will be aware that, in March 2018, Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust was allocated over £300 million to undertake a radical transformation of its acute hospitals at Shrewsbury and Telford. Since then, the trust’s management have been engaged in finalising the strategic business case, but as a consequence of changes to the Green Book and clinical standards the cost will have increased. Will the Minister commit to meet with Shropshire and Telford MPs once the business case is complete to help to ensure that the project can still be delivered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=4362"&gt;Edward Argar (The Minister for Health)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHS E&amp;I and the Department of Health and Social Care wrote to the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust on 19 November last year confirming we remain committed to supporting the scheme. This letter confirmed the allocation remains at £312 million at this time, and of course my right hon. Friend will recall that I committed to approving the request in principle for £6 million of early funding to continue to develop the scheme. It is an important scheme, we want to see it proceed and I am very happy to meet him and fellow Shropshire colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OMIW ARTICLE: After 2 Years of Campaigning, Six Month Rule for People with Terminal Illness Scrapped</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/terminal-illness-campaign-win/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=terminal-illness-campaign-win" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="xmsonormal">Last week, there was some rare welcome news from the UK Government on my #scrap6months campaign to improve access to welfare support for people living with terminal illnesses.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">As some of you may recall, back in 2017, I set up a cross-party group on Terminal Illness after hearing about the horrific treatment my constituent received from the DWP. Despite having being diagnosed with a terminal illness, they couldn’t get fast-tracked access to welfare support because they couldn’t prove that they only had six months to live. Just imagine how that felt, having just received a terminal illness diagnosis.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Their plight had been brought to my attention by the Macmillan CAB team at Raigmore, who are relentless advocates for those they support. I have worked closely with Elaine Donnelly and the rest of the MacMillan CAB team on several issues since 2015.  Their passion and determination to help people near the end of their lives is unfaltering. They are unsung heroes and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for all they do.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">In taking the issue on behalf of my constituents to Parliament, I found out that thousands of people had the same experience with the welfare system. Working with Marie Curie, we launched an inquiry and forced the UK Government to review the system. We have been waiting two long years for the outcome of that review, and yesterday the Minister announced that they would extend the end of life fast-tracked support to those with a diagnosis of 12 months or less to live. While this doesn’t go far enough – the arbitrary timescales need to go – this move will ensure thousands of people living with a terminal illness will now get access to support. I’m incredibly proud of the work we have done on this, and we will keep on the case.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">These sorts of wins are rare, but they do make such an incredible difference to people’s lives. However, the fact remains that if these decisions were made in Scotland, this rule would not have existed. You don’t need to take me at my word on that; two years ago, when faced with the question of how it would deal with this rule when it takes over Personal Independence Payments, the Scottish Government decided to remove the rule in its entirety. This is the difference when you build a social security system with dignity at its core.</p>

<p>The Government have been widely criticised for the cuts, having promised to maintain international aid spending at 0.7% of national spending in their manifesto during the last general election.</p>
<p>The motion was passed by a margin of just 35 votes, following a sizeable Conservative rebellion.</p>
<p>Speaking after the vote, Tim said: <em>"This is a dark day for our country.</em></p>
<p><em>"Britain is respected around the world for the help that we give to the world's poorest.</em></p>
<p><em>"For the Conservative Government to break our promise to those people, during a pandemic and a climate emergency no less, is as unpatriotic as it is appalling.</em></p>
<p><em>"It quite frankly shames our country that our Conservative Government is proudly prepared to waste £37bn on a shambolic Test and Trace system and then in the next breath cut money that provides food and clean drinking water to starving children."</em></p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP votes to defeat Conservatives “divisive and harmful hate speech Bill”</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/07/13/karin-smyth-mp-votes-to-defeat-conservatives-divisive-and-harmful-hate-speech-bill/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=karin-smyth-mp-votes-to-defeat-conservatives-divisive-and-harmful-hate-speech-bill" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has voted to defeat the Conservatives’ new law for universities, branded a “hate speech bill” which would enable people from Holocaust Deniers to anti-vaxxers to sue universities or student unions if they are denied a platform to spread their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth has backed the Labour’s record in Government which saw the Party enshrine the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) into UK law which protects freedom of expression, but warned the Conservatives’ plans are trying to solve a problem that does not exist and risks people with offensive and dangerous views being able to sap funding from universities and spread division across our campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence to support the Conservatives’ claim that further action is needed to protect free speech on university campuses.  A survey last year found that just six out of 10,000 events on campus had been cancelled, mostly due to incorrect paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Government’s plans would open the door to legal action which risks tying up universities and student unions in costly legal battles.  Alongside external speakers, university staff would be given a new right to take out legal action against institutions if they were passed over for promotions or new jobs, while student unions could face court battles if they turned away speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s disgraceful that at a time when we desperately need new legislation for social care reform and employment rights, the Conservatives’ are more focused on bringing in new laws that could give a boost to Holocaust deniers, anti-vaxxers and people harmful to the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no evidence that supports the Conservatives’ claim that further action is needed to protect free speech on university campuses, and this ‘free speech’ bill will only serve to protect people who seek to spread division and hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Students and universities have struggled throughout the pandemic with little support, and this Bill will only lead to costly legal battles.  These are clearly the wrong priorities for Britain, and I will continue to stand against these dangerous plans.”&lt;/p&gt;The post &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/07/13/karin-smyth-mp-votes-to-defeat-conservatives-divisive-and-harmful-hate-speech-bill/"&gt;Karin Smyth MP votes to defeat Conservatives “divisive and harmful hate speech Bill”&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com"&gt;Karin Smyth&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is backing a new UK-based campaigning group committed to addressing river pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;River Action is calling on the UK and Welsh Governments to double their respective regulatory agencies’ environmental protections budgets at the next Spending Review in order to tackle the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign was founded and is chaired by Charles Watson, and is supported by an expert advisory board including George Monbiot, Feargal Sharkey, Lord Randall, Ruth Chambers (Green Alliance) and Amy Slack (Surfers Against Sewage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single river in England is now polluted beyond legal limits, leaving England ranged worst in Europe for bathing water quality in 2020. 60% of freshwater species are also now in decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these stark figures, Government funding for the Environment Agency has fallen by more than 70% in real terms over the past decade. River Action are calling on the UK and Welsh Governments to double environmental protection budgets for regulatory agencies in England and Wales, at an estimated cost of £60m annually. A public petition based on the campaign has been signed almost 40,000 times in its first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwynne’s support for the campaign follows on from a recent scientific study in 2019 which showed that an area of the Tame Riverbed was identified as having the highest recorded level of plastic pollution in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very pleased to be supporting this campaign. Our local environment is so precious and needs to be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen in my own constituency the effect that untreated wastewater released by water companies has on our rivers. The Government cannot continue to cut funding for the Environment Agency and expect the problem to solve itself. We need to see a massive increase in budgets and regulatory powers so that we can tackle this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage everyone across Denton and Reddish to support this campaign. We cannot allow our rivers and species to continue to be destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-59/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Monday, as part of my duties as a member of the Panel of Chairs, I chaired the <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c59562b3-8914-42ab-93b1-16b87204e5b6">Second Delegated Legislation Committee</a> in respect of the draft Market Surveillance (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2021. The instrument amends the EU Market and Compliance Regulation which, under the Northern Ireland Protocol, will apply from 16th July 2021. The EU Commission has updated its market surveillance rules, and the UK is required to do the same in Northern Ireland, in order to fulfil its obligations under the Protocol to implement EU goods legislation. The instrument defines the authorities responsible for market surveillance and the enforcing product standards in Northern Ireland; sets out their investigatory powers modelled on the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and creates enforcement powers; and new offences for certain breeches of the new product standards regulations.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning I chaired the first evidence session of the <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/43f599e4-470e-49d2-aa0d-496f54ce649a">Rating (Coronavirus) and Directors Disqualification (Dissolved Companies) Bill</a>. The provisions in this part of the Bill would close a loophole in the powers to disqualify company directors which applies to directors of liquidated companies, but not to those which are dissolved. There have been regular complaints that the process of dissolving companies is abused by some directors to escape liabilities and to avoid investigation of their conduct. The witnesses were Stephen Pegge, Managing Director, Commercial Finance, UK Finance; David Kerr, Fellow, The Chartered Institute of Credit Management; Dr John Tribe, Senior Lecturer in Law, University of Liverpool, and all broadly agreed that this loophole should be closed. The second evidence which took place in the afternoon was regarding provisions to prevent businesses from seeking to alter the rateable value of premises because of any matter “directly or indirectly attributable to coronavirus” largely on the grounds that the Valuation Office Agency could be overwhelmed by the volume of requests, and that a large number of such appeals could amount to a shadow revaluation of much of the non-domestic property. The witnesses were Adrian Blaylock, Lead Revenues Advisor, Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy; David Magor, Chief Executive, Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation; Sarah Pickup, Deputy Chief Executive, Local Government Association; Andrew Agathangelou, Founder, The Transparency Task Force; Kate Nicholls, Chief Executive, UK Hospitality; and Duncan Swift, Past President of R3.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning I chaired the <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/004f6e9b-24b5-4aa3-832a-ff94fae9afe1">line-by-line consideration</a> of the Bill, plus selected amendments, tabled by the Official Opposition Shadow Ministers, represented by Seema Malhotra MP and Jeff Smith MP. The selected amendments were three new clauses. NC1 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to report the number of former directors of dissolved companies investigated and disqualified by the Insolvency Agency. NC2 and NC3 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to publish assessments of the rateable value provisions, and the misconduct investigations contained in the Bill. The new clauses were debated, but not supported by the Minister Luke Hall, nor the majority of the members of the Bill committee, so the question that I report the Bill (unamended) to the House was carried.</p>
<p>I took part in a number of All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) this week. On Tuesday lunchtime, I joined the APPG on Pension Clawback. Our chair, Clive Betts MP explained that the APPG was first launched in the last parliament, and reconvened in December 2020, its aim is to try and put pressure on HSBC to get a fair deal for pensioners of the Midland Bank post 1974 scheme who discovered they would lose part of their occupational pension upon reaching state pension age. The process is unfair and especially discriminatory against women. Colin Denny, chair of the Midland Bank Clawback Campaign, explained that Covid-19 had frustrated much of the group’s activity, and a resolution to defeat clawback was defeated by institutional voting at HSBC’s 2020 AGM. We resolved to write again to the UK Government Minister; try and enlist support from Local Authority Pension Funds Group; and other organisations such as Pension Investment Research Consultants. Also, to approach Parliamentary Select Committees, and ask them to conduct an enquiry into clawback. And ask the House of Commons Library for advice as to whether – clawback is legal in today’s society; details about clawback formulas; how many companies use clawback; and enforcement or capping details. All members of the APPG agreed that – even if clawback is legal it’s morally wrong.</p>
<p>As a vice-chair, I attended the APPG for Music. David Warburton MP, stated that he had met with the Chancellor, who was still not in favour of extending his coronavirus support package to the music industry, but was interested in discussing how insurance for music events could be developed. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, Chief Executive of UK Music, stated that the cost of furloughing workers could have been used instead as insurance, because festivals have been cancelled already, due to lack of confidence in the coronavirus situation, without UK Government-backed insurance. Workers in his industry would much rather work than be furloughed. The furlough scheme and VAT exemption will terminate in September, which will be more devastating for the sector, and the chancellor needs to help to make the music sector viable and sustainable. It’s a commercial sector which has never asked for help before. David Martin, Chief Executive of Featured Artists Coalition, stated there was concern that the UK Government had not clarified the situation for musicians to tour the EU post Brexit. The EU market is four times bigger than the US market for musicians, but there has been no progress since January 2021. With the new rules, where musicians can only make three stops in EU countries, touring is not financially viable, unless there is a EU wide solution. Grace Meadows, Campaign Director, Music for Dementia, and music therapist, is leading a campaign for the Utley Foundation to build access to music for Dementia patients. Grace spoke about the power of music to a person’s health and well-being, especially during the pandemic, its use is very important for recovery and rehabilitation, growing back stronger communities and finding the meaning of arts and culture in communities. There are an estimated 2 million people with Long Covid and Grace believes that music will be of great benefit to their healing process.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, I attended the APPG on choice at the End of Life, where we heard testimonies from faith leaders about the the religious context of assisted dying. Speakers included Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, Dr Taj Hargey, and Dr Bill Crawley, all of which gave impassioned speeches about the case for assisted dying as the most dignified, merciful and compassionate act of a human. Recent research found that 84% of people are supportive of the concept, and 82% of Christians are in favour. We also heard from Dr Stephen Duckworth, a disability rights campaigner and someone who has changed his views on assisted dying. Dr Duckworth is now an ardent supporter of assisted dying and campaigns for changes to the law.</p>
<p>I then joined the No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) APPG. We discussed the impact of the end of the European Settlement Scheme (EUSS) on families with no recourse to public funds. The 30th June as the end of the grace period for EEA nationals, and family members living in the UK by 31st December 2020, to apply under EUSS for leave to remain under settled or pre-settled status and secure post Brexit residence rights. EU nationals arriving after 31st December 2020, must apply for a visa and will be subject to NRPF conditions. Amy Grey, Rights of Women EUSS Project, gave evidence about helping women fleeing domestic abuse who are vulnerable, destitute, homeless, have literacy problems, and who are not aware of the need to apply. It is possible to make late applications, but on 1st July the free movement laws that had protected European residents came to an end and they are now subject to UK immigration control and will be liable to detention and removal. The Home Office has said that eligible individuals will be given 28 days to make an application. Barrister Mike Spence of Doughty Street Chambers spoke about the pending legal challenge in the Supreme Court (Fratila and Tanase v SSWP &amp; AIRE Centre) regarding pre-settled status (individuals with less than 5 years UK residence under EUSS) and the lack of access to benefits, which risks homelessness and destitution. On 9th June, the High Court ruled that Home Office guidance, which had excluded non-EU primary carers of British children (called Zambrano carers) from applying under EUSS, if they already had or could apply for permission to remain under a different route. This came only weeks before the EUSS deadline and opened up applications for thousands of eligible families. The Home Office is appealing against the ruling, but has agreed an extension for applications until guidance is redrafted, but many families remain unaware of their potential right to apply under EUSS, and many will need immigration advice for this complex process. Mike Spence believes that the Supreme Court will agree with the High Court, but the problem is that the Secretary of State has lots of discretion to reformulate the rules.</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday, I attended the launch of Diabetes UK “Diabetes is Serious” campaign and heard how the pandemic has caused a rapidly growing health crisis for diabetes care. Diabetes affects 4.9 million people in the UK and a further 13.6 million are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. With the right education, care and support, people with diabetes can live healthy lives, but without it diabetes can lead to serious conditions such as amputations, strokes, and heart attacks. Every week, diabetes leads to 185 amputations, over 770 strokes, 590 heart attacks, and 2300 cases of heart failure. In May 2021, Diabetes UK reported cases of diabetes were at an all time high, and diagnosis had doubled in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening I joined the British American Parliamentary Group AGM, of which I’m a life member, chaired by the Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing. The Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Speaker were re-elected Honorary Joint Presidents, and sixteen Rt Hons were elected as Honorary Vice-Presidents. Six members of the Government and six members of the Opposition were re-elected as members of the Executive Committee from the House of Commons plus six peers from the House of Lords.</p>
<p>I was moved this week by the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/10-year-old-who-collected-20990633">news of young Alfie</a> collecting football boots for people who can’t afford them. The 10-year-old from Neath is football-mad according to his mother and he was horrified to learn that some children aren’t able to have their own football boots. After collecting some pairs and coming across the fantastic Boot Room Project, run by Swansea-born Carl Bradley, Alfie wanted to continue to collect boots and allow more children to love the game as he does. It’s sometimes very humbling to look at the world through a child’s eyes – it isn’t fair that some children miss out on sport because their parents simply cannot afford the equipment and we should do something about that. Well done Alfie – you’re an inspiration to us all!</p>
<p>I am disappointed that the UK Government has not seen fit to include added protections for shop workers facing unprecedented levels of abuse in the Police, Crime, and Sentencing Bill. The Labour Party tabled amendments to the Bill that would create a specific offence of assaulting a retail worker with a sentence of up to 12 months, and a new offence for assaults committed as a direct result of workers enforcing statutory age restrictions.  This would have given greater protection to retail workers as they go about their jobs, particularly when enforcing statutory age restrictions on the sale of products such as acid and knives.  Currently, a shop worker can be prosecuted for not enforcing the law on age related sales but has no specific protection for abuse they may encounter when doing so. This is not fair. These amendments were voted down by the UK Government in Parliament on Monday evening, as they continue to refuse to support a specific law that would protect retail workers. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) 2020 survey of shop workers found that 88% of respondents had experienced verbal abuse, 60% had been threatened by a customer and 9% had been assaulted.  Retail staff being asked to enforce social distancing and face masks to keep shoppers safe has put them more at risk of experiencing abuse, with 79% of shop workers reporting that abuse was worse than in 2019.  This is simply not acceptable.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch on issues that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, enjoy the weekend, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe!</p>

<p>Last week, Graham met with Paul Coe, Chairman of the Wombles of Beverley to pay thanks for all the work they have put into preserving Beverley’s green spaces and public hotspots that people have come to depend on more during the pandemic to meet loved ones. During this visit, Graham also joined them on a quick litter-pick, with Paul and other dedicated members of the group.</p>
<p>The litter-pick started with a quick sweep of the Samman Road Play Area and made its way along the street towards the Burden Road Play Area. The park was heavily coated in litter and broken glass. Speaking with local parents, Graham was told that the park had become a hub of anti-social behaviour, as play equipment is being vandalised more frequently and that littering is a growing issue.</p>
<p>Graham praised the group’s innovative litter-picking equipment loan scheme, giving groups, schools and other concerned residents the opportunity and means to clean up their immediate area. Currently, litter picking tools, bags and bag hoops are available at two shops in Beverley; the Refill Jar and The Co-op on Lincoln Way.</p>
<p>Graham commented, “I would encourage anyone that can to get outside and follow in the Wombles’ footsteps. This wonderful group of enthusiastic and public-spirited individuals is a stellar example of how residents should come together to maintain and preserve the beauty of their communities and natural surroundings.</p>
<p>“I was pleased to see that there is so much more to the group than just litter-picking; not only does their work have obvious environmental benefits, but is a wonderful way to get outside, get some exercise and meet new people.”</p>
<p>Paul Coe, Chairman of the Wombles of Beverley, commented, “It is very welcome that Graham Stuart MP wanted to and got fully involved in a recent litter-pick with us at the Burden Road Play Area. It was our pleasure to meet him and talk to him about the problem.</p>
<p>“We purposely took him to an area that regularly suffers from littering and Graham saw at first-hand how bad it was.</p>
<p>“Part of our constitution is “To work in partnership with public authorities to raise the profile of littering and to arrange for the most efficient disposal of the litter collected.</p>
<p>“We hope that through this visit, that this will encourage more decision makers to work with us for the benefit of all residents in Beverley and the surrounding area that we cover.</p>

    <title>Cancel the cut taking £153 MILLION from struggling Birmingham residents</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/cancel-cut-taking-%C2%A3153-million-struggling-birmingham-residents" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, has called on the Government to reverse their decision that will see the lowest paid families in Birmingham having to shoulder the burden of £153 million of cuts.</p>
<p>The Government originally announced a £20 increase in Universal Credit at the onset of the Coronavirus crisis. The fact this step had to be taken shows that the Tories’ social security system is not fit for purpose as the existing level of support was inadequate.</p>
<p>Now, the Government is looking to push ahead to stop this payment meaning that 146,880 people in Birmingham will be £1,040 worse off per year and represents a £153 million cut in Birmingham alone.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “The actions of this Government are shameful. If they push ahead with this staggering cut, it would be devastating for thousands of families that are already struggling to get by. Families who have spent the past year worried for their jobs and their financial security.</p>
<p>“For those on low incomes, £20 a week is the difference between food in the fridge and money on the meter. Cutting incomes to some of Britain’s poorest, while unemployment rates are reaching record highs, shows the Conservatives simply don’t understand the realities of people’s lives.</p>
<p>“In my constituency of Edgbaston, the jobs crisis has meant those claiming Universal Credit has risen by 66% in the last year. This is not the time to be taking away support to some of our most financially vulnerable families and I will keep fighting the Government to cancel this callous cut.”</p>
<p>This cut will impact six million families nationwide, including those on working tax credits.</p>
<p>There is now near-universal opposition to these plans. Labour, the House of Commons, dozens of charities and campaign groups and now, the six preceding Conservative Work and Pensions Secretaries of State all agree that this money must remain in place.</p>

    <title>The Government Must Give Mineworkers a Fair Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/the-government-must-give-mineworkers-a-fair-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I co-signed a letter alongside 45 other MPs representing coalfield communities calling for the Government to give members of the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme a fair deal. However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently chose to ignore our concerns by announcing plans to take a further £1.2 billion from the schemes special reserve fund. This shows the disregard the Conservative Government has for the hard-working people in our community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme has 152,000 members, a number of whom live in South Shields. Currently, the average pension for former miners in the Scheme is £84 a week. The Government have already received over £4 billion from the scheme due to a surplus sharing arrangement set up in 1994, which gives 50% of any surplus to the Government. I believe the surplus money could provide a direct and almost immediate financial uplift to many retired miners’ pensions, providing greater financial security for them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, rather than acting to right this historic wrong, the Government have continued with unjust arrangement that will see more than a billion pounds extra taken from retired miners’ pensions. It’s morally wrong that miners and their families are seeing their pensions raided in this way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more shocking is that those who worked through their lives in the dark and sacrificed their health to keep the country going should be treated in this way.&amp;nbsp; The Government consistently uses “levelling up” rhetoric but is happy to take funds from retired miners in our community without ever having contributed money to it.&amp;nbsp; This injustice must stop now and make sure that there will be justice for miners in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For our coal mining history, pension members and their families, I will continue to lobby the Government and campaign for a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="706" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-164" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-325x211.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>

<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

    <title>Local Labour Leader Says Eastern Leg of HS2 Essential for Jobs and Better Transport</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/07/08/local-labour-leader-says-eastern-leg-of-hs2-essential-for-jobs-and-better-transport/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The Leader of Nottingham City Council, Cllr David Mellen, has written to the Secretary of State for Transport urging the Government to press ahead with the Eastern Leg of HS2, including the HS2/conventional Rail Hub Station at Toton, HS2 connectivity to Chesterfield and the Infrastructure Maintenance Depot at Staveley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The City Council has been a strong advocate for HS2 over many years and played a leading role in the development of the East Midlands HS2 proposition. This has also included the publication of the East Midlands HS2 Growth Strategy in 2017 which estimated the development could create 10,000 highly skilled jobs for the region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Writing in his letter to the Government Cllr Mellen says, “Only Toton and the full Eastern Leg can provide the extra rail capacity necessary to deliver the efficient and resilient rail network the East Midlands needs, transforming connectivity to Leeds, Sheffield and the North East, with the possibility of further extending the network to Newcastle and Edinburgh in the future.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Highlighting the potential benefits for local people Cllr Mellen continues by saying, “Only Toton can support the new and better jobs our people need and the kind of local public transport networks other regions take for granted.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Historically, the East Midlands has been under-funded for infrastructure with the Institute for Public Policy Research reporting that  London receives £5426 per person on infrastructure spending while the East Midlands only receives £438. There has been some concern that the Government might scrap aspects of the Eastern leg as part of a cost saving measure – something Cllr Mellen is determined to fight against. .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Concluding in his letter to the Minister, Cllr Mellen says “I would urge you to use the publication of the Integrated Rail Plan to confirm the Government’s intention to build the Eastern Leg of HS2 in full, and to allow us to realise our transformation plans for the Hub Station at Toton, on which we have worked together with neighbouring authorities and with your support over the last decade.” &lt;/p&gt;

<p>At its heart the proposal <u>should</u> have been looking at viable opportunities to provide housing and employment across our communities on appropriate local sites.</p>
<p>Instead, the proposal simply seeks to drive a coach and horses through the green lungs of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>
<p><strong>The proposed development on our precious Green Belt is unacceptable to me and I know from the many emails that I have already received on this matter that it is unacceptable to you too.</strong></p>
<p>I am still of the firm belief that there are an adequate number of brownfield sites across the Black Country which should be developed first instead of forging ahead with the wholesale destruction of our  Green Belt and Open Spaces.</p>
<p>That’s why I will be questioning the housing allocation numbers and asking why it is that my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and the wider Walsall area are being expected to do the heavy lifting and why we are being asked to take a disproportionate number of houses.</p>
<p>Whilst at this stage the Black Country Plan is only a ‘proposal, it remains extremely important that when the consultation starts in August we all feed in our views.</p>
<p>When I have further information about the consultation I will update you all.</p>
<p>However, please be assured that I will be opposing this plan on behalf of the residents of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>

<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s great to be back on constituency days again. Being out and about in the constituency.</p>
<p>“Meeting people, visiting schools is vital work for any constituency MP and frankly the kind of thing which has been really difficult to do during COVID. It’s just not the same when you’re on a Zoom video- fantastic to be back out in person.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr Shapps’ first visited recently painted murals in subways by the station in Hatfield.</p>
<p>Two pedestrian subways in Hatfield have been transformed into works of art, to provide safe and attractive walking and cycling routes between Hatfield Station and Hatfield House.</p>
<p>Badgers, butterflies, balloons, and bicycles are just some of the colourful new images to be seen in the transformed subways, along with murals celebrating Hatfield’s role in the development of the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>The improvements to the subways have been undertaken by Hertfordshire County Council in partnership with Network Rail and supported by Hatfield House and the local community. The redecoration is part of a programme of works to brighten and improve pedestrian subways across Hertfordshire to make walking and cycling more attractive options for residents.</p></div>

It’s also lovely to note that lots of school children were involved in creating these murals.</p>
<p>It supports something I’ve been saying for a long time- if you want people to active travel, their surroundings need to be pleasant, and well looked after. I’ve cycled through these subways quite a lot and I’ve got to say they’re looking so much better. My congratulations to all involved.”</p>
<p>Phil Bibby, Herts County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport, said: “Improving these subways in Hatfield is part of a wider programme to encourage active travel and reduce car use across the county.</p>
<p>Walking and cycling have so many direct benefits to both physical and mental health, and if everyone made a few more journeys on foot or bike, and a few less in the car, that would have a big impact on air quality, and therefore on everyone’s health. That’s why improving routes like these is so important to us.”</p>
<p>Next stop for Mr Shapps was Stanborough School in Welwyn Garden City, where he met with Headteacher Merry John to tour the school, check on its progress, and open a newly completed Music &amp; Drama block.</p>
<p>The opening, at which teachers, governors and students attended, Mrs John said: “This new block is a fantastic base for our young musicians and performers- they deserve the best. I’m really pleased to see that during lunchtime, during lessons, it’s a thriving place for our students. Thank you so much to Grant for being able to join us for the official opening.”</p></div>

&lt;p&gt;Reacting to news that Bradford Bulls will now continue to run an Elite Academy, Bradford South Labour MP Judith Cummins said, “I’m pleased that the club and the RFL have reached a resolution that enables Bradford to continue to run an Elite Academy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would, however, have been better for all concerned to have avoided the worry and trauma in the first place,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ms Cummins had challenged the RFL on the process and decision that saw Bradford losing out in the award of Elite Academy licences. She questioned whether quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and deep roots into the community game had been given little weight in the consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Bulls Academy has been productive and respected for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There remain challenges ahead but I’m looking forward to working with and supporting the club and the RFL to make sure that the sport has a healthy future,” said Ms Cummins.&lt;/p&gt;

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2021/06/worcester-residents-will-benefit-as-parliamentary-constituency-boundaries-remain-unchanged/"><![CDATA[<p>A major review of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England have recommended no change to the boundary of the Worcester constituency. The proposals will lead to some constituencies undergoing major change and some will be abolished altogether, but Worcester MP Robin Walker believes the continuity will benefit Worcester residents.</p>
<p>The recommendations published this week follows extensive research by the Boundary Commission for England, an impartial body responsible for recommending on boundary changes independent of political or parliamentary influence. Boundary reviews take place at regular intervals to account for population changes which lead to varying constituency sizes. Previous proposals involved reducing the  number of Members of Parliament to 600, although this plan was dropped due to the additional workload created for MPs by Brexit.</p>
<p>The initial proposals will see England gain 10 seats, though the West Midlands will lose two. Minor changes will take place in Worcestershire, with no change to the name or boundaries of the Worcester constituency. Their first report will now be open to consultation where members of the public can share their view of the proposals.</p>
<p>Worcester MP Robin Walker was elected in 2010. He said:</p>
<p>“I have spent the last 11 years working to improve Worcester and the lives of people who live here and the current boundary proposals allow me to continue doing that. Despite being the most politically challenging seat for us in Worcestershire I am proud to have increased my vote share at every election since 2010, and I will continue working to push that further.</p>
<p>“Many people recognise that meaningful change can take years to achieve and many years of hard work have recently paid off recently as we have received a major investment into our high street, £15 million for the A&amp;E at Worcester Royal and, of course, today’s incredible announcement of nearly £20 million to transform key Worcester town centre sites. I am working on a number of other key campaigns including better rail services for Worcester and better education facilities for young people in Worcester.</p>
<p>“In addition to that, I have an established team who have spent years getting to know residents, key issues and incredible community groups who I work with on a day to day basis as the MP for Worcester. I have good working relationships with officers and councillors across the political spectrum at Worcester City Council and am glad we will be able to continue working together.</p>
<p>”It is worth noting that these proposals are still only drafts but I can say that I fully support the proposals and believe they will benefit Worcester residents.”</p>
<p>The review will make its final report in 2023 and the boundaries will come into force for the subsequent election. Any resident wishing to make a comment about the boundaries can do so at <a href="https://www.bcereviews.org.uk/">https://www.bcereviews.org.uk/</a>.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
