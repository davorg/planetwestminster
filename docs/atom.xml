<p>On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, in evidence to the Select Committee on Science and Technology, the chair of the Government’s Social Mobility Commission said that</p>
<p>“physics isn’t something that girls tend to fancy. They don’t want to do it, they don’t like it…I just think they don’t like it. There’s a lot of hard maths…The research generally…just says that’s a natural thing”.</p>
<p>She said she was</p>
<p>“certainly not out there campaigning”</p>
<p>for more girls to do physics, adding:</p>
<p>“I don’t mind that there’s only 16%”.</p>
<p>That contradicts the lived experience of many girls and women who love maths, such as myself, and research from many organisations and institutions such as the Institute of Physics, the all-party group on diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering and maths, which I chair, and, most importantly, the Government’s own stated policy on encouraging girls in STEM. Can you, Mr Speaker, advise me: given that we are proroguing today I cannot lay any written questions, so how can I ascertain whether the Government have changed their policy on encouraging girls into STEM?</p>

    <title>Gwynne unveils VE Day mural alongside Friends of Reddish South Station</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-235151" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FORSSS-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FORSSS-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FORSSS-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FORSSS-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FORSSS-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FORSSS.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, joined the Friends of Reddish South Station on Sunday to unveil a new mural to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unveiling of the mural, which should have taken place two years ago, was delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. The commemorative artwork was designed by children from 1st/4th Reddish Scout Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of Beavers, Cubs and Scouts attended the event, and Gwynne was joined by Reddish South Councillor Janet Mobbs. Attendees were also treated to a performance by The Belle Vue Brass band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends of Reddish South Station is a community campaigning group which was founded in 2007, and aims to restore Reddish South Station to its former glory. The station is one of the quietest in the UK, with only one return journey scheduled per week. FORSS is campaigning for the station to be properly reopened, with a regular passenger service from Stockport to Manchester Victoria via both Reddish South and Denton, an aim that Gwynne supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting on the event, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It was an honour to be invited by Friends of Reddish South Station to help unveil this extraordinary mural, and I&amp;#8217;m really grateful to the children from 1st/4th Reddish Scout for devoting so much time and effort to creating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the context of renewed hostilities in Europe, this mural serves as a poignant reminder that the victory won 77 years ago is fragile. As we celebrate the end of the Second World War in Europe, our thoughts and prayers remain with Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>The deadline for submitting Basic Payment Scheme 2022 applications is Monday 16 May 2022 and, under these plans, farmers with eligible applications will receive the first payment of 50% from the end of July and the second from December.</p>

<p>With agricultural commodities closely linked to global gas prices, farmers are facing rising costs for inputs including manufactured fertiliser, feed, fuel and energy. Output prices, particularly wheat, are also high and from analysis published by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) it is clear that farmers should continue to buy their inputs as usual. The steps government is taking to bring forward payments will allow them to do so.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne, who is a recipient of Direct Payment for his family farm, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I spoke to Defra Secretary George Eustice after Easter about the need to give further support to farmers, who are facing the immediate impact of increased costs to fuel, fertiliser and feed. While farm gate prices remain stable, this does cause significant cash flow issues, so taking a more flexible approach to Direct Payments is a help in the right direction.”</p>

    <title>Change the Protocol</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2022/05/09/change-the-protocol/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did not vote for the final Agreement with the EU for three reasons. The  first was all my experience of the EU taught me if you do sign an Agreement with them they ceaselessly try to enforce it selectively and in a biased way against you. It behaves badly to all its neighbours and tries to boss them as if they were member colonies of the project. Secondly I thought the NI Protocol a mistake . Thirdly I wanted to end all EU say over our fish. On fish and the Protocol the government tried to assure MPs these were provisional or transitory arrangements which would be changed. The Protocol contains a clause to allow alteration and the fishing agreement was transitional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected the EU has sought to use the Protocol as a battering ram against our U.K. Union or as a device to keep the whole U.K. prisoner of the single market and its rules. The EU always sides with the nationalists in Northern Ireland and with the Republic of Ireland as an EU member state in a way which continuously undermines the Good Friday Agreement. That  peace settlement in NI requires the consent of both the nationalist and the Unionist communities  in NI to any political development or decision. The EU claims to want to uphold that Agreement yet does everything in its power and some things beyond its legal authority to alienate the Unionist community and split it from the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unionists now refuse to form and work in a devolved government at Stormont all the time the EU interprets the Protocol in a one sided way to throttle GB/NI trade. The EU&amp;#8217;s bigoted inflexibility, refusing to agree that GB/NI trade should not face any internal barriers crossing the Irish Sea has damaged business in NI and made Unionists feel cut off from the rest of the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for NI and the PM must now legislate in the U.K. to make clear that GB/NI trade will be governed as England/Wales or London/Liverpool trade is governed, in accordance with those statements in the Protocol to respect our internal market. The U.K. legislation should include making  it an offence to seek to pass on any goods traded under the GB/NI provisions to the EU to uphold their main requirement in the Protocol.  This will be enforced by the U.K. as we currently enforce anti smuggling measures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ARTICLE: I Won’t Give Up on Unfair Energy Prices</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/article-energy-prices/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=article-energy-prices" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The UK Parliament was prorogued last week, marking the end of this Parliamentary term. As is the way at Westminster, there is a lot of pomp and ceremony attached to the process, but, in short, prorogation allows the Government to reset parliamentary business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Parliament will recommence on the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May, with the Queen&amp;#8217;s Speech marking the beginning of the new legislative session. At this point, we learn the bills the Government intends to pursue over the course of the next session of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Readers may recall that Boris Johnson was found to have illegally prorogued Parliament during the Brexit negotiations. He used this process to avoid scrutiny by MPs of his Government&amp;#8217;s Brexit deal – which resulted in him having to make a formal apology to the Queen. At the time, it was almost unthinkable that any Prime Minister would act to bring their own Government into disrepute. Now we know it was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before the end of Parliament, my Energy Pricing (Off Gas Grid Households) Bill was published. If passed, the bill would oblige the UK Government to act to ensure households do not have to pay more for energy because they do not have access to mains gas supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The current energy price cap is based on the assumption that households across the nations of the UK consume energy with a split of 80% gas and 20% electricity. However, about one in six homes across the nations of the UK are currently off the gas grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The end of the parliamentary session means this bill will fall, along with many others. I will keep on the issue in the new parliamentary session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last week, I also presented Highland News Media&amp;#8217;s petition on unfair electricity charges to 10 Downing Street. It was great to see so much support across the Highlands to end these unfair charges and rest assured, I will continue to work on this issue on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before I sign off, I want to take this opportunity to wish all the candidates standing for  election to the Highland Council well. Whatever separates us in politics, we all want to see the best for our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To everyone else – don&amp;#8217;t forget to vote this Thursday to elect your local Councillors. If you have a postal vote and haven&amp;#8217;t filled it out yet, there is still time, and it can be returned to the polling station on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

<p></p>



<p>Councils across the West Midlands, hold elections tomorrow. In Birmingham all 101 seats are up for grabs. The winners have the privilege of serving for the next four years.</p>



<p>I expect turnout to be low, less than 30% could decide those who run local services. I regularly come across folk who are dissatisfied about a council matter. It&#8217;s tempting, although a bit harsh, to point out they could have participated in the ballot and chose not to.</p>



<p>In some countries there&#8217;s a legal requirement to vote. I don&#8217;t favour that because I think it&#8217;s the job of politicians to persuade people, but I wonder if, in local elections, we could incentivise people?</p>



<p>Those who register get a better credit rating, although that&#8217;s no guarantee of voting? Is there an argument for saying that those who vote should get something more, for example, a 5% discount on council tax? After all, local elections are about what you get for that council tax.</p>



<p>I also strongly feel that, as with MPs, it shouldn&#8217;t be a one-off exercise about a cross in a box and that&#8217;s it for another 4 or 5 years.</p>



<p>Elections should be the start of a process, a conversation about what you want and those you elect to deliver it.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t always agree with some of my constituents but I&#8217;m happy to hear from them, especially about their concerns. It&#8217;s important councillors hear your views on the decisions they make.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve seen people in countries, previously denied a vote, standing in the baking sun for hours just to make their mark on the paper.</p>



<p>When people don&#8217;t vote, democracy falls into decay and that can lead to a situation like Russia, where a dictator feels free to act with impunity, sacrificing the lives of his own young men and butchering innocent civilians.</p>



<p>Most people know where my politics lie but whatever your views, I urge you to vote tomorrow.</p>



<p>People fought and died for our freedoms in the last war. Please take part and hold elected representatives to account. That&#8217;s the way to keep our democracy relevant and alive!</p>

<p><strong>Home Office granted right to live in UK through tier 1 scheme to 46 people aged 21 or under, FoI request reveals</strong></p>



<p>Anti-corruption campaigners and MPs have warned that “the kids of oligarchs” may have used their parents’ money to buy the right to live in the UK after it was revealed that the government granted “golden visas” to 46 people aged 21 or under.</p>



<p>The Home Office on Wednesday disclosed that it approved 46 applications for the tier 1 investor visa scheme to those aged 21 or under over the last seven years, following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-04/gen-z-millionaires-buying-golden-visas-in-the-u-k-raises-alarm">a freedom of information request from Bloomberg</a>.</p>



<p>The golden visa scheme – which was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/london-laundromat-how-golden-visa-scheme-created-uk-haven-for-dirty-money">scrapped in February over fears that it had been exploited by Russian oligarchs</a>&nbsp;– was designed to attract wealthy people to the UK and required applicants to invest at least £2m.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thousands used it to secure fast-track rights to live and work in Britain, and the scheme was particularly popular with Russian and Chinese families.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/john-penrose">John Penrose, a Conservative MP who serves as “the prime minister’s anti-corruption champion”</a>, said the revelation raised concerns that golden visas could have been “a loophole for kleptocrats’ children to live gilded lives in London funded by dirty money”.</p>



<p>He added: “If golden visas were granted to the brightest and best young entrepreneurs, Britain will have benefited hugely from the jobs, energy and wealth which they will have created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The answer is for the government to publish its long-promised review of golden visas, so we can see what really happened and when. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, as the saying goes.”</p>



<p>It was previously revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/russian-oligarchs-on-uk-sanctions-list-were-granted-golden-visas">eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin</a>&nbsp;were also granted golden visas to live in Britain. The Home Office has declined to name the sanctioned individuals who were given visas, and who Johnson described as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”.</p>



<p>Dr Susan Hawley, the executive director of <a href="https://www.spotlightcorruption.org/">Spotlight on Corruption</a>, said the latest revelation of potential abuse of the golden visa scheme was “deeply concerning”.</p>



<p>“Due to a loophole in the golden visa regime, there were little to no checks on the source of wealth if the money was gifted to the person applying for the visa,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This means the kids of oligarchs may have used their parents’ money, possibly obtained through corruption, to secure UK residency, exemplifying yet again how the regime facilitated the flow of dirty money into the UK.Advertisement</p>



<p>“The government urgently needs to publish a report on the national security risks golden visas posed, so that there is a fuller understanding of these risks, and appropriate action is taken.”</p>



<p>Launched in 2008, but with its origins in an investor route dating back to 1994, the scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights along with their family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The speed with which applicants were given indefinite leave to remain was hastened by how much money they planned to invest in the UK: £2m took five years, while £10m – a higher option introduced in 2011 – shortened the wait to two years.</p>



<p>After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors who were awarded visas from 2008 to 2015. The review has yet to be published.</p>



<p>During a “blind faith period” between 2008 and 2015, 97% of investors were subject to scant checks on the legitimacy of their wealth leading to concerns about undesirable people slipping into the country, say critics.</p>



<p>According to Spotlight on Corruption, 6,312 golden visas – half the number of all those issued – had been reviewed for “possible national security risks”.</p>



<p>Duncan Hames, director of policy at the anti-corruption campaign group&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/">Transparency International UK</a>, said: “Media investigations, court cases and the occasional snippet from ministers have shed some light on the pasts of some visa recipients, but we are still largely in the dark about the true extent of abuse of the scheme.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office">Home Office</a>&nbsp;should publish its long-overdue review, with individual cases investigated where there are concerns that the applicants made their money through crime or corruption. Only through some genuine openness can we hope enough people will learn from the mistakes of the past.”</p>



<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have made it clear we will not tolerate abuse of our immigration system and we closed the tier 1 (investor) route to ensure those who have profited from dirty money cannot gain access to the UK.</p>



<p>“The new Economic Crime Act, which received royal assent after an expedited passage through parliament, delivers a package of measures to bring tougher sanctions against those who facilitate illicit finance in the UK and empowers law enforcement to investigate entities who do not comply.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;During the visit to a bustling Oaklands Campus, the Welwyn Hatfield MP took questions from&lt;br&gt;students, who were keen to hear his views on a range of issues, and to learn more about the&lt;br&gt;work of MPs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Students used the opportunity to ask Mr Shapps about what inspired him to get into politics, as&lt;br&gt;well as issues that impacted them locally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to an extensive Q&amp;amp;A with students, Mr Shapps toured the college with Principal&lt;br&gt;Andrew Slade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair discussed many aspects of the college, including its development plans and proud&lt;br&gt;record of producing national-level athletes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When speaking about the visit Mr Shapps said, “it was fantastic to see so many young people&lt;br&gt;with such a burning interest in politics, and as I said during the visit, they should get involved at&lt;br&gt;all levels &amp;#8211; whether that be through campaigning, debating, or even standing for office&lt;br&gt;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I hope many of those in the room today were inspired &amp;#8211; just as I was as a younger person &amp;#8211; to&lt;br&gt;take up the mantle and stand up for what they believe in, regardless of political persuasion.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following Mr Shapps’ comments, Mr Slade added, “I’d like to say a massive thank you to Grant&lt;br&gt;for taking the time to come to Oaklands and talk to our students about Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was great for them to hear first-hand all about the work of an MP, especially a Cabinet&lt;br&gt;Minister, and how Parliament operates.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP, Angus MacNeil has today met with a family who fled war-torn Ukraine to come to the Isle of Lewis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id="3788" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/photo-29th-april/" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg" data-orig-size="2507,1621" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1.8&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;SM-G780F&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1651236465&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;5.4&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;50&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0.0003&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;58.358178155556&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;longitude&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;-6.55694295&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="photo-29th-april-" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-3788" srcset="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=150 150w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=300 300w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/photo-29th-april-.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Derek and Nataliya Macleod from the West Side of Lewis contacted Mr MacNeil for help in arranging for family to get out of Ukraine following Russia’s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil and constituency office staff had weeks of frantic dealings with the Home Office, who bizarrely insist that people who have been caught up in the conflict must go through the visa application process before coming to Scotland.&amp;nbsp; After many weeks and angry exchanges with the Home Office they are finally safe with family on Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Derek and Nataliya Macleod were anxiously trying to get their family out of Ukraine to come and live with them in their home on the West Side of Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The grim policies of the UK Government insisting upon visa applications which involved an immense amount of paperwork and added enormous stress to what was already a traumatic time.&amp;nbsp; This was in stark contrast to EU countries which showed compassion and waived the need for visas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This has probably been one of the most challenging cases I have dealt with and I can only begin to imagine how stressful a time this was for Derek, Nataliya and family.&amp;nbsp; Nataliya told me that she lost kilograms in weight and didn’t sleep well for weeks because of the extra stress to get them to safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today I was very pleased to meet with the family.&amp;nbsp; As MP for the islands, I conveyed my delight and that of everyone who has spoken about it, that the family have made their way to safety.&amp;nbsp; There was a funny moment, when one thought my face was familiar, later she realised that she had seen me asking questions in the House of Commons for Ukrainian people to come to Scotland, which she said she had seen broadcast on Ukrainian TV before she left.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a moving and happy moment when the youngest of the family, 6-year-old Nataliia gave me a poster she had made as a thank you which I will put on the wall in my office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Derek Macleod said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would just like to say, on behalf of myself and my wife’s Ukrainian family, the biggest thank you to Angus MacNeil MP and Constituency Office staff, we are so grateful for their help to get to the island safely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Home Office said that there was a visa application centre in Warsaw that we could walk into and do the biometrics and application but that wasn’t quite true and we were going to have to wait till the 22nd to be seen. Then we were told we could go to Ireland to do biometrics there, however Dublin was very busy as it was St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day and the rugby was on, making finding a hotel an issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turned out that the UK Visa Centre in Dublin were unable to take our biometrics and we had to apply again for the 4th time in order to just register the passports on the application, luckily most of this work was done in Angus MacNeil’s Constituency Office in Stornoway which helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The hoops we had to jump through was very expensive, in travel and hotels, and it was traumatic for our whole party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I truly hope I never have to go through that ever again. It took me over 2 weeks to get a proper sleep.&amp;nbsp; I was imagining vivid scenes of possible deportation and disappointment, I was terrified of failing these people and having to say I&amp;#8217;m sorry, I lied to you when I said I was taking you to safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We had to go through 4 different countries over 4 days and take disappointment after disappointment to get them finally here, God only knows how we got here. My mother is the greatest person in the world in my book, and knowing she was praying for me every minute of the day, kept me thinking we were going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you are in a situation where everything goes wrong, but somehow you managed to get through it even shocking yourself that you managed to get them here. It was like that but on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now sitting in the sun breathing Hebridean air celebrating May Holiday together.&amp;nbsp; Life for them is truly better and we say thank you, thank you, thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weekly Round-Up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/04/29/weekly-round-up-25/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-25" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a busy week in Parliament this week. I started by joining the debate on Football Governance. Bristol City Football Club are key to both the culture and the economy of south Bristol. I recently met the chief executive, who is keen on the work done by Tracey Crouch MP and wants to see it progress. The report she led into English football called for the creation of an independent regulator for the game and greater powers for supporters and fans with an improved “owners and director’s test” for those looking to control local clubs. Rivalry in the city is intense, but I asked the Minister to join me in supporting the work of Caz May and Lucy Ford, who are fans of Bristol Rovers and the founders of Her Game Too. I also pressed the Minister for details of the review of women’s football. Getting more women involved in football can only bring benefits – team sports for women, the camaraderie involved, the opportunities for fun ways to keep fit and exercise, as well as the opportunities for young women to have inspirational role models. I hope that the work of Her Game Too, and all the women and girls involved in grassroots football, are included in that review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I responded on behalf of the Labour Party in the debate on the Health and Care Bill. One of the major issues that the Government is still failing to address is around workforce challenges. Workforce planning is a huge issue in its own right, but it is also fundamental and cuts through everything we are talking about on health and social care. Chiefly, the problem is that unless we face up to the scale of the workforce challenge, the Government will not deliver the shorter waiting times that patients need. Until this Government breaks out of their straitjacket—unless somebody can make the Chancellor see reason—nothing is going to change for all our constituents. The Government should start today—otherwise patients will be left wondering why they are paying more and more in taxes but waiting longer for care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals around the care cap calculations are a less generous version of what was in the Care Act 2014 and this is a massive step backwards. Once again, I could read out a ring binder full of analysis and evidence provided by the legion of stakeholders, none of it complimentary. We hear the repeated claim, “This solves the problem of social care. It is fixed.” It simply is not. Let us leave aside the deeply insulting attitude that the care and support of people in need, who could live better, more fulfilled lives, is a “problem” to solve; we should be celebrating the fact that people can live better, for many years longer, with multiple conditions, with decent support and care. We all know that to be true. The proposals the Government have put forward do not deliver any more care; they just change who pays for it. Money will go to those with assets, and the less you have, the more they will take. The proposals will have no real impact for years, but we all know that people need help now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the National Strategy for Self-Care. Self-care refers to long-term conditions and preventive health measures. It is an important component for healthy living. We all need to be clear that self-care is not passing responsibility that should be with professionals to the individual, or that we are using self-care to prop up our increasingly underfunded health and social care systems. We need to look at self-care in a positive sense, as has been discussed, as empowering people and patients to know and understand their own bodies and their own physical and mental health, but also to know how to manage the many things that life throws at us all along the way, and to do that from a young age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-care is about lifestyle choices, but also about better awareness of symptoms and when it is important to seek professional advice. Our professional systems should be set up with that in mind, starting with empowering people and not telling them all the time what they should be doing or expecting them to be at the end of a professional opinion. There are many examples, but with cancer symptoms, early diagnosis is crucial and we know that can be a matter of life and death. We also need to understand when an ailment can be treated by someone themselves, and when to do that, or by talking to community pharmacists. The more information we give people about self-care and when to seek help, the more we can help unburden the health service to deal with those who really need medical intervention. And the more we can help people to live healthy lives, physically and mentally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I spoke on LBC and GB News about the High Court ruling that Government policies on discharging untested patients from hospital to care homes were unlawful. This ruling shows there was no such thing as a ‘protective ring’ around care home residents and carers during the pandemic. The Government failed on its duty of care and lost control of the situation. For years before the pandemic even began there was not the capacity in the social care system to enforce quarantine areas to control large numbers of infection, the Government knew this and knew about asymptomatic transmission before the first lockdown was implemented, but still failed to act. Care homes and social care have been an afterthought for some time, and with no plans from the Government to improve capacity, particularly staffing levels, I fear they have still not learnt from their mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday I attended the prorogation of Parliament. This is a long-established tradition whereby at the end of the parliamentary session MPs are called into the House of Lords by Black Rod to hear the Commissioners prorogue parliament. The Commissioners are appointed by the Queen to end the session when she cannot attend the ceremony, which historically the monarch never does. Prorogation marks the end of a parliamentary session, which usually lasts for a year. During the ceremony the clerks read out the Acts that have gained Royal Assent. Parliament is now closed until the Queen’s Speech opens the next Parliamentary session on 10th May.</span></p>

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-3/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with one of my regular updates about local issues.</p>
<h2>Chalk Pit</h2>
<p>Firstly the latest on the Chalk Pit in Epsom.</p>
<p>I am waiting for news as to whether the controversial retrospective planning application will be called in by the Government. This does not normally happen if a local authority has given permission for a development, but I am hoping that this case will be different. If it is called in, there will be a proper enquiry into the situation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the business which has been causing most of the problems has been sold and is moving its operation off the site. Unfortunately another firm has been using the site as well, and is now applying to take over the permit for the site. As this firm were ordered to leave a previous site in Morden because of noise and dust pollution, I am strongly opposing the granting of a licence to them. After representations from myself and local residents, the Environment Agency has agreed to treat the application as a matter of high public interest which means it will be subject to a much more detailed investigation and consultation than would normally be the case.</p>
<p>In addition I met the Chief Executive of the Environment Agency before Easter to discuss the problems at the Chalk Pit and I am hopeful that the Agency will now be more robust in its approach to dealing with the noise and dust nuisance there. I know that the high level of nuisance has been continuing and will do all I can to hold them to the promises that they are now making.</p>
<h2>Southern &amp; Southwestern Rail Services</h2>
<p>I have also met the Chief Executives of our two local rail companies to protest about the poor levels of service at the moment. On the Southern Route I have been promised additional trains from Epsom to London Bridge, but I am pushing for them to go south of Epsom as well as the service from Ashtead and further down in Mole Valley is not good enough at the moment.</p>
<p>With SWR I am in particular pushing for additional trains from Ewell West, Stoneleigh and Worcester Park in the peak as crowding levels are clearly now bad again. In particular the service after 8am is much too thin. I will update you when I get a response from them.</p>
<h2>New Hospital Sutton</h2>
<p>I have been asked by some local residents what is happening about the potential new hospital at Sutton. This has clearly been delayed by the pandemic, but I understand that a planning application is due in the coming months. I do not expect the new facility to be open until the second half of the decade, though. For now I do not expect any change to local services.</p>
<h2>Citizens Advice Drop in Hours</h2>
<p>The Citizens Advice team in Epsom have restarted their drop in service at their office in the Old Town Hall after closing it during the pandemic. The service can offer you help and guidance about a range of issues, including benefits, housing, debt, fuel poverty, family issues</p>
<p>The service is available as follows:</p>
<p>Monday – Friday                  10am – 4pm   Adviceline Telephone service</p>
<p>Tuesday (from 17<sup>th</sup> May)    10am – 1pm    Drop in service</p>
<p>Thursday                               10am – 3pm   Drop in service</p>
<p>Address: Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell, The Old Town Hall, The Parade, Epsom KT18 5AG</p>
<p>Adviceline:      0808 278 7963 (free to call)</p>
<p>Email:              <a href="mailto:office@caee.org.uk">office@caee.org.uk</a></p>
<h2>Appeal for Former Scouts</h2>
<p>Finally an appeal for former Scouts in the area.</p>
<p><em>3<sup>rd</sup> Epsom Scout Group is celebrating its 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. Based in the Scout Hall behind St John Chandler Hall on Church Road (just off East Street), we are the oldest continuously running Scout Group in the area</em></p>
<p><em>Did you attend Beavers, Cubs, Scouts or Explorers with the Group when you were younger? Did your children go there? Did you volunteer as a leader there? If so, we would love to hear from you. </em></p>
<p><em>This summer we are holding an event to celebrate our centenary and would love to have old members and other friends of the Group join us. If you have any memories or photos of your time in Beavers, Cubs, Scouts or Explorers, we’d also love to hear from you.</em></p>
<p><em>To join our alumni mailing list and find out more about how we’re celebrating, go to:</em><em> <u><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/F71jCJy3mcqqDPROCVL4Un?domain=3rdepsom.org.uk">https://www.3rdepsom.org.uk/Alumni.html</a></u></em></p>

    <title>Preet demands emergency budget, as figures reveal Brits could spend £10bn extra annually on soaring petrol prices </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-demands-emergency-budget-figures-reveal-brits-could-spend-%C2%A310bn-extra-annually-soaring" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, has called on government to act over the spiralling cost of living crisis with an emergency budget, as figures show the impact of soaring petrol prices on families across Quinton, Harborne, Edgbaston and Bartley Green.</p>
<p>New analysis by Labour has revealed that families in Birmingham and across the country will fork out an extra £10bn on petrol, compared to just this time last year. </p>
<p>The Chancellor made a 5p fuel duty cut the centrepiece of his plan to tackle the cost-of-living. However, it has been entirely overshadowed by skyrocketing fuel costs that have increased prices by as much as 47p/litre in the last year, according to the RAC. </p>
<p>The figures come as oil and gas producers, including Shell and BP, took in billions in profits, with BP hailing “more money than we know what to do with”. </p>
<p>Labour today reiterated its call on the government to bring forward an emergency budget to tackle the Tory cost of living crisis. This would prioritise five measures including with a one-off windfall tax on the soaring profits of oil and gas producers to help households through the crisis with up to £600 in support. Labour would also ramp up home insulation, scrap the unfair National Insurance hike, and provide support for struggling businesses.  </p>
<p>Commenting Preet Kaur Gill said: “This is a savage extra cost for working people, particularly given the tax hike to national insurance that people across our city will be facing this week as they open their pay packets. It is outrageous that the Chancellor has raised taxes 15 times – costing families over £1000 this year.  </p>
<p>“The Conservative Government needs to set out an emergency budget to tackle their cost-of-living crisis and support Labour’s call that would put money back in the pockets of working people.  </p>
<p>“Labour’s plan would help households through this crisis with up to £600 cut off energy bills and turbocharge our transition to clean transport so never again are the British people left so exposed to unstable foreign oil.” </p>
<p><strong>ENDS</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notes to editors: </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Labour has called on the government to bring forwarded an emergency budget – and prioritise five measures that could be enacted now, to make a material difference to the millions of pensioners and working people feeling the crunch from the crisis: </p>
<p>  </p>
<ol start="1"><li>
	Put a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut home energy bills: Bring in a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits, to cut household bills by up to £600, including through a VAT cut on home energy bills and an increase and expansion of the Warm Homes Discount.  
	</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li>
	Provide support for struggling businesses: Labour would cut taxes for businesses by giving SMEs a discount on their business rates bill worth up to £5,700 this year, funded by a tax on the online giants. We’d also bring in a £600 million contingency fund, raised by the windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits, for those industries and businesses struggling the most with rising bills like steel and other energy-intensive firms. 
	</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li>
	Spike the hike: Scrap the National Insurance hike which this government has introduced in the midst of a cost of living crisis. 
	</li>
</ol><ol start="4"><li>
	Insulate homes: Commit to a rapid ramp up of home upgrades with a clear target to meet by the end of the year, to make them more energy efficient and cheaper to heat, saving households £400 on average every year.  
	</li>
</ol><ol start="5"><li>
	Stop the waste: Allow the National Crime Agency to investigate the £11.8 billion of taxpayer funds lost to fraud and error, so no more taxpayer money is flushed down the drain.  
	</li>
</ol><p>  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Diesel car:  </p>
<p>  </p>
<ul><li>
	The cost of a litre of diesel has risen by £0.47p over the past year according to Government and RAC data (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices</a>; <a href="https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/fuel-watch/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/fuel-watch/</a>)  
	</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
	There are 1.2 cars per household in the UK, and 12,499,187 diesel cars in the United Kingdom and the average car travels 6,800 miles: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/veh02-licensed-cars" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/veh02-licensed-cars</a>; <a href="https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/number-cars-great-britain#:~:text=How%20many%20cars%20are%20there%20per%20household%20UK%3F,per%20household%20in%20the%20UK" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/number-cars-great-britain#:~:text=How%20many%20cars%20are%20there%20per%20household%20UK%3F,per%20household%20in%20the%20UK</a>; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts09-vehicle-mileage-and-occupancy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts09-vehicle-mileage-and-occupancy</a> 
	</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
	Based on the MPG of an average family car of 43 for diesel, this means on average a car user uses 719 litres of fuel in a year: <a href="https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg#:~:text=The%20average%20UK%20car%20drives,the%20equivalent%20of%20132%20MPGe" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg#:~:text=The%20average%20UK%20car%20drives,the%20equivalent%20of%20132%20MPGe</a> 
	</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
	With the price of diesel increasing by £0.47p per litre 19 April 2021 to 21 April 2022, the rise in fuel prices over the last year leaves a driver using their facing £337 in extra petrol costs over a year (£928 in March 2021; £1265 in April 2022 = £337). 
	</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
	That is an extra £4.2bn for households on diesel. 
	</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
	Diesel was 170.09 on 10 March 2022.

<p>Last week Boris Johnson became the only Prime Minister in British history to be found guilty of breaking the law. On Tuesday he made a statement to the House of Commons on the fines issued to himself and the Chancellor as a result of attending an illegal gathering in Westminster.</p>
<p>His mealy-mouthed apology will have offered little comfort to those families in Leicester West who sacrificed so much to follow the rules. You can see the Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, respond to the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement in the video above or read his response <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-04-19/debates/2C3E878D-6ECB-4FF2-9E3A-7B134989EAA6/EasterRecessGovernmentUpdate#contribution-2FDFBE6F-A5E1-434C-96DE-137D0F985771">here.</a></p>
<p>Labour will force a vote this week on allowing a cross-party committee to investigate whether the Prime Minister misled Parliament about breaking covid rules. Conservative MPs should put the country first, and vote to support an investigation. You can see the motion Labour have tabled on this <a href="https://labourlist.org/2022/04/motion-calling-for-investigation-of-pm-over-misleading-parliament-published/">here</a></p>
<p>The Labour Party is clear. Britain deserves better than Boris Johnson. It&#8217;s time to bring decency, honesty and integrity back to our politics. The Prime Minister is not fit to govern. He must resign.</p>

    <title>We must break our dependence on hostile foreign governments</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/we-must-break-our-dependence-on-hostile-foreign-governments/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Households across the country are reeling from the monumental April energy price cap rise. As of April. the average family must now find an extra £700 per year to cover rocketing energy costs, a crippling rise which the Bank of England say is the single biggest shock since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to that increasing fuel and food costs, and the Chancellor’s hike to National Insurance, the bottom line is that even more families are going to have to choose between heating their homes or eating, all when energy companies are posting record profits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces are attacking peaceful Ukrainian villages, towns and cities with missiles and bombs which are killing innocent civilians, including children. As I said to the Prime Minister during recent questions, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Putin continues to appal most of the world and shames the rest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while Britain plays its part in supporting Ukraine against Putin’s invasion, the situation has also shed a stark light on our economic reliance on energy and investment from hostile foreign governments. It is a dependence we need to break.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a Member of Parliament, my first duty is to ensure the safety and security of our nation and its people. Ensuring that we have proper control of our own energy and infrastructure – the very things we need to keep our country running – is a fundamental issue of national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I called on the Prime Minister to double our production targets for domestically produced hydrogen to reduce our dependence on foreign fossil fuels and improve our energy resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister agreed with me when he said “that’s exactly what we should be doing”. However, these words must be followed by government action to ensure our energy infrastructure and so much more is secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, I have presented my bill to Parliament to tackle the anti-social use of quads by giving police the powers they need to be able to track, seize and destroy illegally used quads, and to make wearing of helmets a legal requirement. I will be meeting with ministers in the coming weeks as I continue to push the government to change the law. I have also called for a wider debate to properly discuss the issue. As we move into summer, nuisance quads will become more of a problem as the days get longer and the weather improves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will also be our first summer in several years where we can properly enjoy outdoor festivals and concerts. These events were a growing industry before the pandemic and will doubtless be hugely popular now restrictions have ended. However, I am deeply concerned by the sheer scale of under reported spiking at these events and the lack of focus on tackling these terrible crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More disturbingly, the support offered to victims of spiking, who are predominately women and young girls, is often inadequate. Medical tents focus on life-saving care and offer no continuity of care or proper safeguarding, while security services are, frankly, often there to protect the venue, and not the festival-goers. On top of that, police recording of incidents at these events is patchy, with no central collection of crimes as part of official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combine this with the fact that those under 18 are allowed to attend often overnight without adult supervision, in a place where they lack their usual support networks, creates a huge safeguarding blind spot that leaves them vulnerable to predatory behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This needs to change. I am working with West Yorkshire Police, government and other agencies to find a solution to further protect young people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe an intervention is needed that requires festivals to have a robust safeguarding plan in place to deal with spiking and sexual assault before they are granted a license. There needs to be better security on these sites and improved staff training to recognise the signs of spiking, as well as specialist medical and support services that means young girls and women can receive continuing care. We also need effective national recording and tougher sentences for these vile crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is great news that Bradford has made it to the final four in the competition to be the UK’s City of Culture 2025. It is a spectacular opportunity to showcase the many brilliant, cultural exports that we know makes Bradford the ideal candidate to win this competition. I have always been outspoken in my belief that sport is one of Bradford’s greatest cultural assets, including the legendary Bradford Bulls in my own constituency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m working with Bradford Council, the Bradford Bulls and others to pull together a levelling-up bid to Government that will put sport and Odsal at the heart of Bradford South’s regeneration plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What better way would there be to celebrate the sporting and cultural potential of Bradford than to become the UKs City of Culture in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catherine McKinnell, Member of Parliament for Newcastle North, has warned that the Conservative Government is too distracted by scandal and law-breaking in Downing Street to support families struggling with a cost of living crisis. Today (13 April) figures showed inflation hit 7% last month, a thirty year high, even before the increase in the energy … <a href="https://www.catherinemckinnellmp.co.uk/cost-of-living-crisis/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">GOVERNMENT TOO DISTRACTED TO GET A GRIP ON COST OF LIVING CRISIS</span> <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></div>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Monday 14th March, I attended the launch of the Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Strategy call for evidence, which will inform the development of the UK Government’s ABI Strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An ABI is defined as a non-degenerative injury occurring to the brain since birth, and includes traumatic and non-traumatic. There are many causes: road traffic accidents, assaults, falls, strokes, infectious diseases, hypoxia, metabolic disorders, and toxins. Our ambition is to prevent brain injuries wherever possible and change the care and support to those with an ABI, so they have the chance of the fullest quality of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the launch we heard very emotional evidence from suffers of an ABI. Chris Bryant is chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for ABI, and I’m the vice-chair. Chris had a Private Members’ Bill (PMB) on ABI which received its Second Reading on 3rd December 2021, and proposed that the UK Government prepare and publish to meet the needs of children and adults with an ABI. There are over 1.3 million deaths costing £15 billion to the UK economy every year and is cross departmental, affecting Health and Social Care, Work and Pensions, Education, DCMS, Ministry of Justice, and Housing, Communities, and Local Government. Chris gained cross-party and Government support for his PMB propositions. UK Government committed to publishing a strategy, and set up a Call for Evidence overseen by Chris and Minister of State for Care and Mental Health, Gillian Keegan MP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/acquired-brain-injury-call-for-evidence">Call for Evidence</a> will be open for 12 weeks, and anyone over 16, and stakeholders, can respond. Link to Call for Evidence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monday’s business in the Chamber started with a debate on Lords Amendments to the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill. At 6:14pm we voted on Lords amendment 1, which would have tilted the balance back towards Parliament by giving the House of Commons a vote on a dissolution of Parliament, because the Bill as drafted gives the Government power to decide, losing by 217-292 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next debate concerned the Professional Qualifications Bill, which the UK Government had introduced in the Lords. When the Bill was going through the Lords and at Committee stage Labour argued, without success, that UK Government should be required to consult with the Devolved Administrations before making regulations. However, UK Government has inserted New Clause 1 into the Bill which is on point, and on its return to the Commons, we supported this. We also voted on amendment 3, which would give Scottish and Welsh Governments power to revoke or amend measures in the Bill, at 7.07pm, losing by 210-296 votes. We abstained on the Bill’s Third Reading at 7.26pm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next debate was on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-14/debates/AFFC9F8D-F3B7-4DD7-877B-F36620B67362/AnimalWelfare(Sentience)Bill(Lords)">Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill</a>, which the UK Government again introduced in the Lords. We voted on Labour Front Bench New Clause 1, which would place a duty on the Secretary of State to produce an animal sentience strategy and provide an update to Parliament, at 9.27pm, losing by 179-286 votes. We then voted on Deidre Brock’s, SNP Opposition, New Clause 3, which we supported because it would require the Animal Sentience Committee to produce a report on the adverse effects of the UK Government’s welfare of animals policy on experimentation on animals, at 9.42pm losing by 218-288 votes. We supported New Clause 5, tabled by Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat Opposition, which would require the Animal Sentience Committee to produce a report on the impact of polluted rivers on sentient animals, at 9.56pm but lost the division 179-286.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Early Tuesday morning, as vice-chair of the APPG for Steel and Metal-Related Industries, I joined officers of the APPG and representatives from UK Steel, and for a virtual meeting with Lee Rowley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at BEIS. The Minister for Industry set out the UK Government’s overall vision, strategy and plan for strengthening the British steel industry, followed by answering some questions posed by the APPG officers. The Minister spoke of the need to support the steel sector and of the importance placed on our sector by the PM and the Business Secretary. We pressed him on the timeline for action on industrial electricity prices, which he didn’t have any details, but assured us it was a priority of the UK Government. Later that day, the UK Government announced a 35% tariff on iron and steel imports from Russia and Belarus, following similar announcements by the EU last week. The 35% tariff is on top of existing tariffs, including anti-dumping duties and safeguards, and imposes a ban on high-end luxury goods exports to Russia. The EU, however, has imposed a complete ban on finished steel products. UK Steel raised concerns that Russian producers would have strong incentive to export at any cost and undercut the UK market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the meeting had concluded, we went to <a href="https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/1503786449312825347">College Green to meet with steelworkers</a>, their families, and trade unions representatives from South Wales and Yorkshire, to listen to their concerns and join in their protest against UK Government inaction on high energy costs that threaten the future of the UK steel sector. The UK Government must acknowledge the importance of steel as a source of jobs, growth, and community. Steelworkers and trade unions were hoping that the UK Government would announce support for the steel sector in the Spring Statement which was scheduled to take place the following week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, as vice-chair of the APPG on the UKSPF, I joined officers of the APPG plus Professor Steve Fothergill, Secretariat of the APPG, for a virtual meeting with Neil O’Brien, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. We challenged the Minister on his Government’s promise that the UKSPF will work up to an average of £1.5bn, (broadly the same as EU funding after allowing for inflation), by 2024-25, because actual spending on projects always lags behind financial commitments, unless it is possible to commit to £1.5bn a year in each of the next financial years, it is unavoidable that after 2024-25 UKSPF spending will once more fall below this threshold. Therefore, we asked the Minister if funding could be cranked-up in the first 12 months. EU funding was based on a 7 year cycle, so long-term transformative projects were possible, so we asked whether UKSPF could be based on a 7 year cycle. The APPG has been calling for funding to be based on a formula rather than a competitive bidding process, and we are pleased that the UK Government has agreed, but the formula needs to be skewed towards the least prosperous parts of the UK in line with levelling up and to replicate EU funding. I asked the Minister what role the Welsh Labour Government will have in the development and delivery of UKSPF local investment plans, because it had been mooted that Welsh Government would be by-passed in favour of direct delivery by local authorities. The Minister assured me that he wants strong input from the Welsh Government on where the money is spent and on what it is spent on in Wales. The APPG would expect this to be reflected in the amounts of UKSPF allocated to Wales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, I attended the virtual confidential meeting of the Western Gateway APPG, co-chaired by Jess Morden MP (Newport East), with guest speaker Jane Mudd, Leader of Newport City Council, to listen to progress made on the Independent Economic Review, the Digital Accelerator Proposal, and the Nuclear Fusion STEP Project. The working group is developing a unique proposition responding to the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) call for a STEP fusion prototype power plant, which could provide opportunities across the entire Western Gateway geography and beyond. Katherine Bennett, Chair of the Western Gateway, said that the working group is on target to meet the submission deadline of 31st March.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Petitions Committee had asked me to open the debate on banning greyhound racing in the UK, and in advance of the debate scheduled for 28th March, I met virtually with the Petitioner who wants to remain anonymous, because of the social media attacks that he/she has suffered since creating the petition in October 2020. The Petitioner impressed on me that greyhound racing causes hundreds of greyhound injuries, deaths, being put to sleep for humane and economic reasons, surplus greyhounds due to overbreeding and those discarded because they were not fast enough, in a sector that is driven by online betting. The Petitioner has serious concerns about animal welfare issues at tracks and kennels at registered and independent tracks in the UK. And there are no vets present at tracks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I chaired <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-16/debates/08D39864-61BB-4567-9019-6A782B5B57B5/In-WorkPoverty#contribution-0FEF020B-E5B0-4457-95F7-2E24D05561CE">debates in Westminster Hall</a>. The first debate was considering In-work Poverty moved by Grahame Morris Labour MP (Easington), and quoted Nelson Mandela “poverty…is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings…Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right to dignity and a decent life…While poverty persists, there is no true freedom.” Mr Morris said that poverty is a Conservative political choice, which this UK Government should be ashamed of. Many MPs from different Parties made contributions to a very lively debate, and David Rutledge MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, responded on behalf of the UK Government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second debate was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-16/debates/7F416143-9BDE-45D0-B18E-BA16CD2EFE7C/FutureOfSoftPower#contribution-539CC3B9-595A-4526-B29D-9ADC9DF15907">Future of Soft Power</a>, moved by John Baron, Conservative MP for Basildon and Billericay, chair of the British Council APPG. Mr Baron said that democracy is a fragile concept which needs nurturing, encouraging and protecting. And in this new Cold War, we need to talk softly and carry a big stick, because soft power was a key factor in victory in the Cold War. The British Council had been in touch with more than 750 million people worldwide for education, arts, and the English language. Mr Baron asked the UK Government to provide notice of full allocation of funding for the British Council for the spending review period; no further cuts which result in country closures; and to stop touting a 26% increase in funding, because the British Council lost £10 million commercial revenue during the pandemic year, closing in 20 countries. The Minister for Asia and the Middle East, Amanda Milling MP, responded for the UK Government and said that since the start of the pandemic her Government had allocated £560 million to support the British Council, including £180 million in grant aid for 21-22, an increase of £40 million from last year, a generous deal in the current financial climate, which Mr Baron said did not answer his questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last debate was about <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-16/debates/14F3F317-4917-4E73-9DF1-086C5C26148A/LocalEnterprisePartnerships#contribution-B42AD62B-1274-4DF5-AC99-200608D739DE">Local Enterprise Partnerships</a> (LEPs), moved by Sally-Ann Hart, Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye. Ms Hart extolled the benefits of LEPs to local economies – more than 2,000 local business leaders give their time and expertise, which encourages a culture of enterprise and engagement. LEPs broker investment that deliver jobs, environment, and local taxes that local communities need and depend on, but the UK Government LEP review has left the sector in limbo, many talented people have left LEPs, and business leaders are impacted. She asked that LEPs have funding to ensure they play a significant part in Levelling Up. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Neil O’Brien MP, responded for the UK Government, and reassured Ms Hart that the White Paper has made sure LEPs have a future and how they fit with Mayoral authorities, and will be funded appropriately. He spoke about LEPs delivering £12 billion local growth fund and £900 million Getting Better fund, plus examples of successful LEP projects throughout England.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday morning I chaired the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-17/debates/9357f561-3280-4d6a-9e8f-9bea07bfbd1e/DraftFoodAndFeedSafety(MiscellaneousAmendmentsAndTransitionalProvisions)Regulations2022">Fifth Delegated Legislation Committee</a> for The Food and Feed Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2022. Edward Argar MP, Minster of State for Health and Social Care, moved the motion whose purpose is to amend a deficiency in Article 53 of the retained General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) to ensure that emergency measures that may be applied where a serious risk to health is identified and applied to all goods entering GB. And amend authorisation provisions for feed additives and GM food/feed so that decisions made by UK Government Ministers will be enacted through legislation making these consistent with other retained EU feed and food law. It will provide a time-limited period of adjustment to 30th September 2022 for businesses to meet new UK address labelling requirements for certain food products, which would allow businesses to use up old labelling stocks, without facing enforcement action for failure to label affected products with a UK address during this time. Shadow Minister Daniel Zeichner MP supported the regulations amendments, but sought clarification on certain aspects. The Minister provided answers, and the amendments were passed by the committee without a division.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon I chaired a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-17/debates/195CB781-62C5-4306-8564-D2B80933CA84/GenderSpecificReligiousPersecution#contribution-CA1FF210-1AFF-4EC5-81C6-37E8BFDA0D5F">General Debate on Specific Religious Persecution</a>, secured by Jim Shannon MP (Strangford – DUP). Mr Shannon stated that although violations of religion or belief can affect any member of a minority community, women and girls from communities suffering from persecution based on religion or belief face a double vulnerability of being at greater risk, and that these have a greater impact on their lives, than men, and gave some very graphic examples of the persecution of young girls. Several MPs contributed to the debate, and there was broad agreement as summed up by Sarah Owen, MP for Luton North, Shadow Spokesperson, that there is a moral duty to intervene in areas of gross violence, suppression and misogyny. The UK Government Minister for Europe and North America, James Cleverly MP, responded, and said that freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right but is denied to millions of people around the world, and that his Government is continuing to work with international partners on a range of measures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday evening I joined <a href="https://www.visitbanwen.org">Banwen’s virtual celebration of St Patrick’s Day</a>, with guest speaker, and a good friend of mine, Mick Antoniw, MS for Pontypridd and Counsel General for Welsh Labour Government, and long-term advocate for human rights, who spoke about the threat to the Rule of Law by the rise of populism and consequent breakdown of democracy throughout the world. Mick also spoke about Putin invading Ukraine, and that Putin wants to destroy Ukraine’s sovereignty. Just before the invasion, Mick had visited his family, who are still living in Ukraine. Another old friend of mine, Tony Lloyd, Labour MP Rochdale, officer of the Ireland and the Irish in Britain APPG who had secured a backbench debate in the Chamber that afternoon entitled “Irish Diaspora in Britain” to celebrate St Patrick’s Day, sent a supportive video message. Banwen claims to be the birthplace and home of Patrick before he became the Patron Saint of Ireland, and this was first put forward in a John Bull magazine in the 1950s, which stated that Patrick was “plucked like a stone from the bog at Bannavem Taberniae, translated as Tafarn y Banwen, a well known local place, and just a short distance from an Iron Age bog. Banwen’s famous local historian George Brinley Evans, now aged 96, and his close friend Tom Marston pioneered this story, and on St Patrick’s Day in 2004 they unveiled a stone at Tafarn y Banwen at an event attended by local schoolchildren and dignitaries to commemorate St Patrick. Last June, Richard Parry, an arts and culture development practitioner, and Roman history specialists Comitatus, were instrumental in organising a re-enactment of the kidnapping of Patrick and his sister Darrerca from Banwen, which included workshops in schools, and Banwen RFC members playing Irish Raider Pirates, who chased, and eventually caught, two children who were cast as Patrick and his sister, as they tried to evade the pirates by running around Banwen. There will be more celebrations this summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Friday 18th March, Parliament was sitting for Private Members’ Bills (PMB), and because my PMB on Marcora Law was listed at number 37 in the Order Paper, there was no likelihood of it being debated. Therefore, my PMB has been re-listed for Friday 6th May 2022.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday 21st March, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, I attended an executive meeting of the Wales Co-operative Council to plan forthcoming events to be held in respect of the founder of the Co-operative Movement Robert Owen, who was born in Newtown Powys on 14th May 1771. He was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropist, and social reformer, founder of utopian socialism and the co-operative movement. His aim was to improve factory working conditions, and he promoted experimental socialist communities and sought a collective approach. Last year’s events were held online, but it is hoped that on 14th May 2022, we can hold some physical events in celebration of Robert Owen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday afternoon the UK Government granted Labour an Official Opposition Day Debate in which we considered P&amp;O Ferries and Employment Rights. We pushed the debate to a division after 6 hours of protected time, but as is becoming the custom of the UK Government, they once again instructed all Conservative MPs not to take part in a vote that we push to a division at the conclusion of our Opposition Day Debates. We won the vote 211-0, in which all opposition Parties joined us in the Yes Lobby, but once again, this victory is symbolic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, I pledged my support for a net-zero, nature positive future, for UK landscapes, where people and nature thrive alongside each other when I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1507401933945860099">World Wildlife Fund Earth Hour event in Parliament</a>. The rise in global environmental movement in recent years has shown how many people care about our planet. On 26th March at 8.30pm lights around the world would be switched off for an hour in solidarity so people could come together to look after one another and our shared home, at the 15th Anniversary of Earth Hour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then I joined the virtual launch meeting of Unite’s “<a href="https://www.unitetheunion.org/campaigns/get-me-home-safely-campaign/">Get Me Home Safely</a>” campaign. We heard from speakers within Unite, organisations supporting the campaign, and former MP Tracy Brabin, now Mayor of West Yorkshire. The purpose of the campaign is to make sure that night shift workers get home safely, because experiences of sexual assault, harassment, violence and stalking are common occurrences on streets and on public transport. Workers have a right to access safe transport at all hours of the day, but many find this difficult after a late shift. Unite representatives said that delayed and insufficient UK Government support for taxi drivers during the pandemic has caused shortages, and in the bus sector, decades of privatisation, legislative failure, a commercialised and unregulated systems have caused cuts to services, increased fares, and a deficit of 4,000 drivers. The campaign seeks to organise workers from across the sectors and committees of Unite to take ownership of the safety and wellbeing of workers by extending their duty of care to implement safe transport home principles for night shift workers, which would include: free transport home as a prerequisite for late night venue licences; risk assessments for individual worker’s journey times and potential hazards after leaving work; lobbying the UK Government to ratify ILO Convention 190 to end harassment and violence in the workplace; trained staff, enforcement, and reporting of sexual harassment and violence on public transport; clear and operational CCTV on all public transport; municipal ownership of buses; national minimum standards for taxi and private hire vehicles and an end to cross border hiring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon I attended our weekly Petitions Committee meeting to discuss the petitions delivered in Westminster Hall during our regular weekly Monday night slots, and to receive information from the clerks to the committee about petitions that have reached the threshold of signatures and will be debated in the future, including Government responses to petitions that have recently been received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a member of the APPG for Mutuals, which has over 100 members from both Houses, I attended its AGM and programme of work meeting for an update on our campaign to prevent LV= being taken over by a private equity firm. I was re-elected as treasurer of the APPG. The APPG was disappointed it had to conduct an inquiry into the planned demutualisation of LV=, but members believe we have acted in the public interest, because the company’s leadership had not presented a strong case for the takeover. Our inquiry collected evidence and conducted interviews with the key people involved with the takeover, and found that every demutualisation over the past 35 years has been driven by the board, not the members, so there’s an imbalance which must be addressed. Demutualisation is bad for members, consumer competition, choice and financial market stability. Customers need mutuals. The sequence of events at LV=, when the company converted from a friendly society and was put up for sale 12 months later, requires scrutiny, and our inquiry has added to information that LV= members can draw from. Read the report <a href="http://appgmutuals.coop/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/APPG-Mutuals-LV-report-April-2021.pdf">here</a>. We heard from Martin Shaw, Chief Executive of the Association of Financial Mutuals, who updated us on the lessons learned and the actions needed, following the attempted demutualisation of LV=.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The division bells sounded at 4.15pm calling MPs to vote, so we drew the meeting to a close and dashed off to the voting lobbies. Votes started at 4.19pm with the UK Government voting to disagree with Lords Amendments 4,5,6,7, to the Nationality and Borders Bill, whilst Labour voted to support all these amendments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 4 was cross-bench, signed by the Labour Front Bench, to delete clause 9 which extended the Secretary of State’s powers in relation to deprivation of citizenship “without notice”. Lord Anderson added some safeguards which the UK Government accepted. We lost by 318-223 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 5 added a new clause which stated that nothing in the Bill authorises policies or decisions which do not comply with the Refugee Convention. We lost by 313-231 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 6 was cross-bench signed by the Labour Front Bench to remove clause 12 which introduced different treatment of refugees by placing them in two different groups. Group 1 would be people who have come to the UK directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened and have presented to authorities without delay. Group 2 would be those who have travelled through a safe third country where they could have reasonably expected to have claimed asylum. We lost by 318 to 220 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 7 was a Tory backbench amendment supported by Labour and cross-benchers, and provided asylum seekers with a right to work if they are still awaiting a decision after 6 months. The Home Office’s own figures show there are 61,864 applications pending an initial decision after waiting for 6 months. We lost by 291-232 votes.</p>

<p>My week ended with a visit to <a href="https://www.hoperescue.org.uk">Hope Rescue Centre</a>, near Llanharan as part of my research ahead of presenting E-Petition 554073, which is asking the UK Government to introduce legislation to abolish greyhound racing by a managed shutdown of activities, and to ensure the welfare of dogs. I met Vanessa Waddon, who sold her house to set up Hope Rescue after a greyhound called Last Hope was discovered abandoned on Caerphilly mountain in 2004, having been shot with a captive bolt gun, and his ears hacked off to hide identifying tattoos. When Last Hope was found, he was alive, but had to be put to sleep due to the severity of his injuries. I also met Alain Thomas from Greyhound Rescue Wales and a volunteer called Malcolm who had adopted Hector, a lovely greyhound who had been rescued from a racing track after breaking his left front leg trying to negotiate the very sharp first bend of the track.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday 28th March, I attended the AGM of the Alternative Dispute Resolution APPG, and was re-elected vice-chair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday evening, I opened the debate on E-Petition 554073, which asks the UK Government to abolish greyhound racing through a managed shutdown and ensure the welfare of redundant greyhounds by a levy on the industry. The petition closed on 30th April 2021 with 104,885 signatures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, the Petitioner wanted to remain anonymous because of attacks via social media, so it was my responsibility to present their words to the MPs who attended the Westminster Hall debate. The debate was well attended, with MPs presenting contrary views. The Petitioner, Vanessa Waddon, supporters and a rescued greyhound Suzy were in the public gallery listening to the debate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Petitioner believes that the welfare of racing greyhounds is not adequately protected by animal welfare legislation, the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB), independent bodies, and that greyhounds endure suffering on dangerously configured tracks, are raced in extreme weather, and housed in kennels not independently inspected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following pressure from welfare charities and campaigners, GBGB have been required to publish annual data of racing greyhounds since 2017, but Dogs Trust and the RSPCA have questioned the accuracy of this data, and it is not broken down to track level, so does not flag remedial action if needed at a specific track.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the data is very concerning. Between 2017 and 2019, a total of 14,770 were injured, and 1643 were put to sleep for humane or economic reasons. The Petitioner discovered that greyhounds recorded as being in rescue centres, or re-homed as a pet, were still racing. Greyhounds recorded as retired are sometimes sold or given away to race on the 3 Independent tracks in the UK. Therefore, the dual system of registered GBGB and Independent tracks, does not work because greyhounds are being interchanged between the two separate systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My speech included details that Vanessa had told me when I visited Hope Rescue. Vanessa supports the UK campaign and in September 2021, Hope Rescue launched the Senedd Petition to ban greyhound racing in Wales, which received 35,101 signatures, and was discussed by the Senedd Petitions Committee on 7th March. The committee agreed a “call for evidence” followed by a debate in the Senedd. Another example of the Welsh Parliament leading the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vanessa told me that she set up the “Amazing Greys” project at the Independent Valleys Track at Ystrad Mynach in April 2018, so that Hope Rescue could provide emergency rescue places for injured and surplus greyhounds before transferring them to Dogs Trust, Greyhound Rescue Wales, or Forever Hounds Trust. Between April 2018 and August 2021, the project took 200 greyhounds whose owners or trainers had links with Valleys Track. 40 had serious injuries and 5 didn’t survive. Many had old undiagnosed injuries, lameness, skin and dental problems, fleas, worms, and suffered with anxiety and fear. 67% of the injured greyhounds were GBGB greyhounds, reinforcing the Petitioner’s assertion that there is no division between GBGB and Independent tracks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The majority of injuries were broken legs, snapped bones going through the skin. Valleys Track boasts its “eye-watering sharp first bend” on its website. Dr Andrew Knight’s “Injuries in Racing Greyhounds” report 2018, explains that because races are run anti-clockwise, most injuries occur on the left foreleg and the right hind leg, when negotiating a bend the left foreleg is used as a pivot, claws digging into the track, and the right hind leg moves in an arc providing the propulsive force, causing maximum stress. The bones become spongy, and honeycombed. Vanessa and her volunteers were heartbroken when they took the injured greyhounds to Hope Rescue vets, and witnessed their immense suffering. There were no vets at Valleys Track. After publicly sharing the E-Petition, Vanessa was told that Hope Rescue was not welcome at Valleys Track, so the current fate of the injured and surplus greyhounds is no longer known.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Public attitudes to greyhound racing are changing. There were once 77 GBGB tracks and 200 Independent tracks in the UK, but now only 20 and 3 remain. 99% of UK bets on greyhound racing are placed online, so this doesn’t benefit the local economy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hope Rescue commissioned a YouGov Poll which showed that 45% of the public support a ban, 17% do not, and 38% are unsure, or don’t support either option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andrew Rosindell MP Romford, and Ian Lavery MP Wansbeck spoke in favour of greyhound racing and believed that GBGB are serious about improving welfare regulations. Neil Parish MP Tiverton and Hinton, chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee spoke about the report on greyhound racing that his committee produced in 2006, and said that UK Government and the industry should take the petition seriously, and use it as a very positive approach to ensure that welfare of greyhounds is improved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>John McNally MP Falkirk, SNP spokesperson, spoke in support of the petition. Ruth Jones MP Newport West, Opposition spokesperson, stated that the Labour Party do not support a ban, but greyhound racing should have the safeguards and protections it needs: proper guidance on best practice in responsible ownership; statutory minimum standards for racing and welfare; better methods to trace ownership; and a centralised database to record retired greyhounds. Ruth asked the Minister to get on with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Petitioner and Vanessa believe that a ban is the only solution. This can be achieved immediately in Scotland and Wales, who have very few tracks (Valleys Track is the only track in Wales), but in England a ban should be phased-in to ensure that displaced greyhounds can be accommodated, and infrastructure dismantled over time. I asked the Minister if she would meet with the Petitioner, Vanessa and myself, and have followed up with a letter to Jo Churchill MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Agri-innovation and Climate Adaptation, whose brief covers animal welfare. Read the full debate <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-28/debates/3D4F5F47-3466-44ED-B67D-C8A7AC0ACC7C/GreyhoundRacing">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday 28<sup>th</sup>, the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-28/debates/7CBF7AD7-B30C-4C50-99BA-DFC38EA79539/PoliceCrimeSentencingAndCourtsBill">Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill</a> returned from the Lords, and at 7.56pm we started voting on Lords Amendments. We supported Lords Amendment 72B, and proposed amendments (a) and (b), and lost the division by 283-148 votes. This would have mandated the police recording of crimes that effectively amount to hostility on grounds of sex or gender, and introduced a stand-alone offence related to harassment or intimidation aggravated by hostility towards sex or gender. We supported Lords Reason 73, and Amendments 74B-74G, and Reason 87G, and lost by 276-202 votes. 73 and 87G would have removed provisions relating to noisy protests regarding making it easier for police to impose conditions on marches and static protests, including powers to impose conditions on a protest public assembly or public procession as “too noisy”. The Government added amendment 74 inserting a definition of “serious disruption”. Amendment 87 would remove the ability of the police to impose conditions on one-person protests. And finally, at 8.23pm we voted in support of Lords Amendment 80G which would have removed increased powers regarding public assembly, and lost by 278-202 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, I attended the Pension Clawback APPG and was re-elected vice-chair.</p>
<p>The APPG was set up to campaign for HSBC to remove state deduction (clawback) from the post 1974 Midland Bank Defined Benefit Pension Scheme, and highlight its discriminatory impacts. Over 51,000 HSBC pensioners are subject to indirect discrimination in one of its 23 pension schemes, but almost no one knew of its existence. The campaign group has repeatedly been refused its requests to meet with HSBC to discuss the removal of clawback. HSBC has recently commissioned a market review of the state deduction in the third quarter of 2020, which demonstrated that integration of private pensions and state benefits to target the overall level of benefit remains an accepted and common aspect of UK pensions practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was followed by chairing the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology officers’ meeting to plan the work programme for the next Parliamentary session. We decided to continue to focus on our campaign to urge the UK Government to amend the Hair Act 1968 to include mandatory registration for any person who wants to practice in the hair sector. The Hair Council has sole authority under the act, and Keith Conniford, the CEO and Registrar of the Hair Council, has been leading the campaign for mandatory registration for many years, and working with the APPG.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I visited a drop-in event to launch Amnesty UK’s Football Welcomes month, with the Afghan Women and Girls Development Football Team. The team and their families fled to Pakistan after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021. The team members successfully appealed to the UK Government to bring them to the UK and the squad are in temporary accommodation in North of England, but are training again. We heard from Khalida Popal, former captain of the Afghanistan team who helped get them out of Afghanistan. The Taliban had prohibited them from playing football. Amnesty International’s Football Welcomes programme celebrates the contribution players with a refugee background make to football and highlights the role of football in creating more welcoming communities for refugees and asylum seekers. On the morning of the event, the Afghan Team had played a match against the UK Women’s Parliamentary Football Club.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, as vice-chair of the Parkinson’s APPG I attended an event held ahead of World Parkinson’s Day, which is on 11th April. There are approximately 145,000 people living with Parkinson’s in the UK, and this is expected to grow by a fifth by 2030. I met with people with Parkinson’s and carers from across the UK to show my support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I chaired debates in Westminster Hall for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At 2.30pm Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, moved the motion <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-29/debates/22032976000001/Gambling-RelatedHarm#contribution-64B680CB-9DB3-45FF-8C17-531DFAB35B0E">that this House has considered gambling-related harm</a>. Ms Harris said that after over two years of debate, reports and evidence sessions and years of harm, addiction and ultimately loss of life, the White Paper is very imminent. And that she and colleagues across the House had faced the onslaught from the gambling industry. Ms Harris quoted many figures from many sources, for example: the charity GambleAware estimated that 1.4 million people suffer gambling related harms; the House of Lords Select Committee on the Gambling Industry found that 60% of gambling profits came from the 5% of people experiencing gambling harm; and she called for improvements to be included in the White Paper. For example: an independent affordability assessment with a soft affordability cap where an open banking check would kick in at £100 a month on net deposits because the average level of disposable income in Britain is £450; that Ministers work with the banking industry to ensure that all banks provide a comprehensive gambling blocking facility; a statutory levy of 1% would provide £130 million for treatment and research; stake limits for online gambling; a gambling ombudsman. She said that the whistle-to-whistle ban is not worth the paper it’s written on, she would not support anything Bet365 has done, and gambling companies spent more than £1.5 billion a year on advertising. Ms Harris welcomed the reforms introduced by the Gambling Commission such as, identity and age verification, banning credit cards, and customers having information on winnings and losses. But she stated there is more to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The debate was well attended and there were some lively interactions from MPs on either side of a very emotive subject. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nigel Huddleston MP, responded for the UK Government. He said that it was 17 years since the Gambling Act 2005 was passed and a review and reform is needed, but he was not able to announce what will be in the White Paper, which will be published in a few weeks. He said that the White paper would set out conclusions of the UK Government’s call for evidence regarding a statutory levy, advertising and sponsorship, gambling black market, and gambling premises licences.</p>
<p>Carolyn Harris MP wound up the debate by saying that she congratulated Bet365 for mobilising speakers and she hoped that its protection of vulnerable customers is as tenacious as its ability to get MPs to come and speak on its behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second debate was about <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-29/debates/3E181745-9543-4058-B54E-E9B6D9FDD0C8/Smoke-FreeEngland#contribution-7FC41681-99C1-45C1-9598-7ECF6F6E4B95">progress towards a smoke-free England</a> secured by Sir Charles Walker, MP for Broxbourne, and he quoted from the UK Government’s “Towards a smoke-free generation”, July 2017, which stated that over 200 deaths are caused every day through smoking, smoking rates are three times higher amongst the lower earners compared with highest earners, accounts for half the difference in life expectancy between richest and poorest, and its vision is a smoke-free generation. But Sir Charles asked what this would look like in 2030, and said that it would be 5% or less of the adult population smoking, according to the Lancet. Currently more than 14% of the adult population smokes averaging £10 per pack, and it could be higher because of lockdown. Cancer Research UK thinks it will be 2037, but Sir Charles thinks 2037 is optimistic. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maggie Throup MP, responded for the UK Government and stated that her records state 13.5% of UK adults smoke, but it’s too high, and there is more to do. She said that the UK Government will publish a new tobacco control plan later this year, which will set out a comprehensive package of new policy proposals and regulatory change, following a review led by Javid Khan, former CEO of Bernardo’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last debate was moved by Dr Kieran Mullen, <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-29/debates/54738924-93F9-45B9-ADCF-252B1532C2A9/GreatBritishRailwaysHeadquartersCreweBid">that this House has considered Crewe’s bid for the headquarters of Great British Railways</a>, and said that Crewe is at the heart of rail industry, and has 360 degree connectivity. Crewe was born from the railways when in 1837, the Grand Junction Railway Company placed a station in Crewe that connected Liverpool with Manchester railways, and London and Birmingham railways, and now has 6 railway lines. More than 3 million people live within 45 minutes commute by road or rail, 12 major universities within an hour commute, and 3 international airports. There is cross-party support from 12 MPs, and Pete Waterman. And all MPs who spoke supported Crewe’s bid.  The Minister of State at the Department for Transport, Wendy Morton, responded for the UK Government and said that this was the fourth debate on bids for the GBR HQ that she’s attended in the past few weeks. She said that she’d recently found out that her dad was born in a railway cottage, railways are close to her heart, and mentioned the Williams-Shapps plan for rail. The competition for GBR HQ was launched on 5th February and closed on 16th March with 42 submissions from towns and cities outside London and across the UK against the 6 criteria: alignment to levelling up objectives; connected and easy to get to; opportunities for GBR; railway heritage and links to the network; value for money; and public support. The bids will be shortlisted and then put to a consultative public vote. There will also be regional divisions of GBR HQ organised in line with Network Rail’s “Putting Passengers First” programme, which reflects how passengers and freight move across the network today. Cities and regions across England will have greater influence over local ticketing, services and stations, stations in partnership with local and regional government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That evening Labour voted against the draft Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No 2) Regulations 2022, and lost by 268-195 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning I chaired Westminster Hall debates, beginning with a very important debate moved by Sir Iain Duncan Smith, <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-30/debates/D706ABB2-F478-4AE9-8F86-4CE0C13C5DBD/BritishAndOverseasJudgesHongKong#contribution-9017292E-F718-464D-8CCF-9530D09C4CA2">that this House has considered the role of British and overseas judges in Hong Kong</a>. Before we began the debate I quoted Erskine May “reflections on a judge’s character or motives cannot be made except on a substantive motion” which Sir Iain’s motion was not. Sir Iain said that the debate was meant to be a demand from across parties that the UK Government should intervene and that British judges now serving in Hong Kong courts should withdraw, because their presence lent legitimacy to a brutal, totalitarian regime that has been prosecuting in Hong Kong against the Sino-British agreement terms, and against people whose only crime has been to cry out for freedom. However, just before Sir Iain came to the debate, he discovered that the UK Government agreed and wish the judges to withdraw, and invited the Minister to intervene to clarify the announcement. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Affairs, Vicky Ford MP, stated that it was laid in a written ministerial statement the night previously, published that morning, read out the statement, confirming that it is no longer tenable for serving UK judges to participate on the Final Court of Appeal, and that Lord Reed and Lord Hodge had submitted their resignations to the Hong Kong authorities that day. All MPs agreed with this statement and Sir Iain summed up by saying that it is a remarkable day, as a result of continual campaigning, and for too long we felt we must accommodate totalitarian regimes that have no regard for human rights, the rule of law, and democracy. The action taken has sent a signal that freedom matters and he thanked the UK Government for having moved on this matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next debate was moved by Elliot Colburn MP and considered<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-30/debates/E2F1FAEF-890C-47E4-9216-6B665B6C8344/HealthcareCarshaltonAndWallington#contribution-F60CB8B0-F645-481E-B761-ADE014032205"> Health Care Outcomes in Carshalton and Wallington</a>, in which he raised issues concerning his constituency, including: cancer outcomes; increase in dementia; obesity and he bravely spoke about his battles with obesity; mental health; and appealed for progress on investment for his local hospital – St Helier. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maggie Throup MP, responded and confirmed that a new hospital for Epsom and St Hilier University Hospital NHS Trust was part of her UK Government’s plans to build 40 new hospitals by 2030.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The afternoon’s debate in the chamber concerned the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-30/debates/159B83EA-68DF-4A72-AFB7-189970DE9114/HealthAndCareBill">Lords Amendments of the Health and Care Bill</a>. We voted on a series of amendments starting with amendment 85 at 5.11pm, which we lost by 275-183 votes. This Amendment mandated a consultation about a scheme to regulate the prices and profits of tobacco manufacturers and importers, to use these funds raised by the scheme on anti-smoking measures. Then we voted for Government Amendment (a) in lieu of Lords Amendment 92, losing by 215-188 votes. This amendment allowed telemedical abortion services to be made permanent, followed by a division on Lords Amendment 29, losing by 249-167 votes. This amendment would require the UK Government to publish assessments every two years with current and future NHS workforce assessments and projections for 5, 10, and 20 years in future. Then we supported Lords Amendment 30, which we lost by 265-156 votes. This amendment would remove clause 40 which gave the Secretary of State significant and largely unchecked powers to intervene at any stage of a local service reconfiguration, with no minimum sets of information requirements on which to base a decision. Then we voted to support Lords Amendment 80, which would have removed the £86,000 cap on social care costs, losing by 247-150 votes. And finally, we voted at 8.57pm to support Lords Amendment 90, losing by 259-147 votes. This amendment required that the option of independent mediation is explored before resorting to legal action in disputes over palliative care of children between parents and doctors.</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <title>City Council Leader Responds to “Levelling Up” Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/02/02/city-council-leader-responds-to-levelling-up-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invitation to Zoom residents&#8217; meeting&nbsp;&#8211; 7.30pm, Friday 27th November&nbsp;2020:</span></strong></p>

<p>As always, if you have a personal or specific issue you would like to raise with me, or for a virtual surgery appointment, do also continue to contact me by replying to this&nbsp;email or by ringing 01773 744341.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
