<p><strong><em>This article was written by John and published in CapX</em></strong></p>



<p>Politics is like plumbing; everyone knows it’s essential and wants it to work properly but, frankly, we’d rather not spend too much time thinking about the details. Quiet efficiency is what most of us want, and the tumultuous weeks since the mini-budget have been anything but that.</p>



<p>So a return to unflappably competent, calm normality would be great. Jeremy Hunt has already made a welcome start by calming the financial markets with a solid restatement of fundamental Conservative values on the importance of sound money and being able to pay your bills. Now we need to pour more oil on troubled waters by choosing a leader who can inspire everyone to come together to defeat some pretty huge challenges. Not just in Westminster or the Tory Party, but right across the country as a whole.</p>



<p>What are those challenges? It’s a long list, but let’s start with unaffordably expensive housing, soaring energy prices and people traffickers shipping thousands of vulnerable people across the English Channel in rubber dinghies. In a normal Parliament we’d have spent the first two or three years grappling with answers to these problems but, because of lockdowns and the pandemic, they’re still sitting in the political in-tray. And there’s only two years left before the next General Election, so the clock is ticking.</p>



<p>Who can bring everyone together? For me, the answer is Penny Mordaunt. She’s been a minister in eight different Government Departments over twelve years, so she’s very experienced: the tight timescale means we need leaders with well-honed instincts and pattern recognition so the Government can take good decisions quickly.</p>



<p>Plus her background makes her a powerful antidote to the cynicism and distrust that so many people feel about politics and politicians in general. She became a very young carer after her mother died and her father became ill, has been a Royal Navy reservist since her early career, and then had to defeat a sitting Labour MP to get into Parliament. In other words she’s had to struggle and work hard throughout her life, and it means her instincts are the same as yours and mine. She’s the leadership candidate who Labour fears the most, and anyone who thinks politicians have to be born with a silver spoon in their mouths should take a closer look at Penny.</p>



<p>What would a Mordaunt-led Government look like? It would keep the focus on driving faster economic growth, but we shouldn’t and mustn’t choose between sustainable, sound public finances and vibrant growth: they aren’t alternatives but two sides of the same coin instead. We can and should have both.</p>



<p>That means keeping Jeremy Hunt’s changes and then adding a strong dose of supply-side economic reforms on top, to make our economic engine rev faster and more efficiently. Fixing the underlying problems in industries like housing and energy means fundamental free-market changes to unblock the arteries of our economy so investment can flow and wealth can be built much faster and with less risk than today.</p>



<p>It means cutting red tape too, but without reducing or diluting the vital standards which protect our environment, deliver net zero, make our food safe to eat and ensure that buildings are safe to live and work in too. Getting rid of regulations has to be about delivering those unchanged standards more cheaply, simply and digitally than today, not cutting them. And that means reintroducing the tried-and-tested ‘1-in-2-out’ regime that worked pretty effectively until it was abandoned five years ago, and we’ve been adding new rules and regulations ever since.</p>



<p>Finally, a Penny Mordaunt premiership would mean smashing the glass ceilings that hold too many of us back across our country as well. Childcare costs are a good example, making work harder and cramping opportunities of working parents everywhere. So making childcare more flexible and affordable will mean more of us can work the extra hours or take on the promotion that moves our careers on to the next rung, or simply handle the pressures of parenting and work a little more easily instead. Levelling up isn’t just about roads and rail projects but extending opportunity right across society, and Penny will lift the day-to-day obstacles that are keeping working people back.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The new Chancellor says he is looking for ways to cut spending to bring the borrowing down. I have sent him a list of ideas familiar to readers of this blog where they have been published before.</p>
<p>Today there are some easy ways to make an impact.</p>
<p>1 Reverse his decision with the  Bank of England to sell some of the bonds they own at a loss. Not selling would save in excess of £10 bn in the year ahead.</p>
<p>2 Work with DWP to improve incentives and support to help 500,000 people on benefits to get jobs. Saving around £5bn from less benefit and more tax.</p>
<p>3.implement Braverman plan to stop small boats illegal migration. Save £3bn in annual additional hotel costs.</p>
<p>4. Cancel HS2 and resell land acquired. Save many billions starting this year.</p>
<p>5. Adjust energy package  to limit subsidised energy for households to the average usage, requiring those who use more to pay full price for the extra.</p>
<p>6 Substitute more UK gas and oil for imports by pressing on with extra N Sea production. This will cut the import bill and boost UK tax revenues substantially.</p>

Despite a longstanding campaign by local campaigners and I who have repeatedly raised questions this unacceptable situation here her the last 10 years, and my successful campaign to secure £600k funding for access improvements via the Government’s Transforming Cities Fund, the work still hasn’t been done - with endless delay, slippage and new obstacles.<br/><br/>
That’s why I convened a virtual summit this morning with key stakeholders to press home the urgency of this issue, find out what the hold up is and pressure them to put their foot on the accelerator. Improved access should be a quick first step on the road to a total regeneration of this key strategic location.<br/><br/>
This has gone on for far too long. We need results quickly.<br/><br/>
Rest assured, I will be working closely with stakeholders and taking the matter to DfT ministers again.<br/><br/>

This had looked inevitable once her mini-budget had to be reversed following the loss of market confidence. The Prime Minister’s diagnosis of the need to do more to increase the growth rate was correct, but sadly the policies she prescribed made the situation worse and it’s right that she has resigned.</p>



<p>We knew that Liz Truss was inheriting a difficult position a few weeks ago with the ongoing cost of living crisis, the significant NHS backlogs, the war in Ukraine and the resulting serious issues with energy prices and supply. To those crises we can now add the market turmoil and the increases in interest rates which are so painful for those with mortgages and will worsen the public finances given the amount of debt we owe – and our ongoing need to borrow.</p>



<p>We should have a new Prime Minister in place by the end of next week, in time for the critical statement by the Chancellor on 31 October setting out the details of the public finances and proposed measures to bring borrowing under control. Regrettably it looks very likely that this will include some difficult measures including tax rises and spending cuts. We will need the new Prime Minister and their team to present a coherent plan that we can unite behind to avoid any further market turmoil.</p>



<p>There has been speculation that these measures should include restricting the increases in the state pension and benefits next April to less than the inflation rate of 10.1%. While increases of this level will represent a significant cost, we cannot seek to balance the books on the backs of the least well off and those unable to work to earn extra money. The state pension has never increased by less than inflation and I’m glad the outgoing Prime Minister confirmed the increase would indeed be 10.1%. We should do the same for benefits too. We can’t expect people livings on the least to get through next winter with less money in real terms than this one.</p>



<p>There have been encouraging signs that global gas prices have started to fall. I hope that this continues and signals that efforts to boost supply and reduce demand around the world have stabilised the position. There are however significant risks this winter and next that in the event of a lengthy period of cold weather we might run out of gas. In the short term we all need to be careful with our use – to reduce our bills and protect supply.</p>



<p>In the longer term we need to do more to obtain secure domestic sources of energy including nuclear, wind solar – and fracking for our own gas. None of these are easy – and very often applications are unpopular. The key thing is to ensure we develop these in areas where they have the least impact and that all applications are properly considered through the planning process with local people consulted. We’ve gone further on fracking and proposed requiring actual local consent which is not required for other planning issues. Again, none of this is easy or popular but relying on cheap imports from abroad is no longer a viable strategy.</p>

<p>The UK now faces its third Prime Minister this year as Liz Truss has resigned after a mere 44 days in the job. The country is facing an economic crisis that cannot be blamed on either Covid or the war in Ukraine but one which is a result of failed economic policies from the Tory Party. What we need is stability and a plan to support ordinary people who are worried about how they are going to get through this winter, not a Party who are fighting with one another and more concerned with clinging onto power than serving the national interest. Enough is enough. We need a General Election now.</p>
<p>I was pleased to be able to speak in the House of Commons this week on the Economic Update from the new Chancellor. Jeremy Hunt has regularly warned that workforce burnout across the NHS and social care had reached emergency levels and was extremely dangerous to the functioning of the NHS. Now that he is in position to make financial commitments, will he stand by the statements that he has previously made? The NHS and Social Care is in severe trouble but its most important asset is its people. We have to invest in them and ensure that they are supported and protected from burnout. But in order to do that we have to put the resources into training places, into ensuring that pay remains competitive, and that we have enough staff to manage the workload.</p>
<p>I was pleased to support the Menopause Mandate this week by joining their drop in. The Menopause Mandate is devoted to creating a coalition of campaigners working to ensure that women receive the advice and support they need from both our health service and wider society. In 2021 Menopause Support revealed that 41% of UK medical schools don’t have mandatory menopause education on their curriculum. The Menopause Mandate wants to see health professionals adequately educated so that women are able to receive the advice and support they deserve. Stats from the Nuffield Health Group revealed that just over a quarter of women who visited a GP said the possibility of their symptoms being menopause wasn’t addressed. Only one in five was prescribed HRT. Too many women say that when they seek advice they are frequently dismissed or not offered HRT or other treatment options. Find out more about the Menopause Mandate here. </p>
<p>This week the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee published our report into the work of the Electoral Commission. We concluded that the recent Elections Act is a “missed opportunity” and has made electoral law more complicated. Challenges lie ahead now for the Electoral Commission in supporting voters, campaigners, and electoral administrators, to understand and navigate the changes ahead of elections in May 2023, when voters will be required to produce ID at the polls to vote. The Government need to ensure that voters, campaigners and candidates, as well as electoral administrators have all the support they need to ensure that our democracy does not suffer from the changing rules and processes. You can read the full report here.</p>

    <title>Judith demands immediate action on NHS dentistry at crisis point</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-demands-immediate-action-on-nhs-dentistry-at-crisis-point/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Bradford South MP Judith Cummins has demanded that the Government act now to halt the crisis in NHS Dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Judith led a cross-party debate in the Commons, calling on the Government to take urgent steps to deal with chronic lack of access to NHS dentistry before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the last seven years, I have spoken about the challenges, I have raised concerns, and I have sounded the alarm that NHS dentistry was facing burdens, pressures and circumstances that it simply was not equipped to handle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leading the debate, Judith said that NHS dentistry was in urgent need of fundamental reform – but that calls for change had largely been ignored by Government:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We now hear on a regular basis, from MPs on all sides of the House, from across the country, raising the concerns of their constituents who are unable to access an NHS dentist. The current system remains unfit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Bradford, 98% of dentists are closed to NHS patients forcing people to go to A&amp;amp;E or to go private, whether they can afford to or not &amp;#8211; often taking out a payment plan because they do not have the luxury of an NHS dentist available to them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research by the BBC shows that 9 out of 10 dental practices in England are not taking on new NHS patients. In Yorkshire and Humber, the situation is amongst the worst in the country – with only 2% of dental practices taking on new NHS patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shocking statistics show that a child born in Bradford is eight times more likely to be admitted to hospital with dental decay before their sixth birthday than children in the former Prime Minister’s region, the East of England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith stated the problem was due to dramatic cuts to funding of NHS dentistry that has fallen by a third in real terms in the last decade, and a serious issue with dentists staying in the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have enough dentists – but they are working in private practice. Until government fixes the problems with the NHS contract which sees highly qualified, experienced dentists squeezed out of the system, they are simply pouring more water into a bucket with a giant hole.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith said: “The situation is appalling. Many of my constituents cannot get an NHS dentist. Instead, people are waiting until they are in severe pain and in a situation where they either have to pay for urgent private care they cannot afford or they end up in A&amp;amp;E clogging up the system, because they do not have the ‘luxury’ of an NHS dentist. NHS dentistry shouldn’t be a luxury. It is a necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have called for fundamental and comprehensive reform that puts early prevention at its heart. Good oral health must not be restricted by your postcode or by your wealth. The Government knows this. I have had Minister after Minister agree that fundamental reform is needed but years on, we are still waiting for action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are fed up of excuses and inaction. The Government needs to act.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <summary type="text">Yesterday, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron put forward an amendment to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill which would legislate to make all UK railway stations meet disability access standards.
Accessibility is a big issue at stations across South Cumbria including at Arnside, Ulverston and Staveley where the only way to the platform is by climbing 41 steep steps.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><img class="content-edited" alt="Tim and Clare Hale at Staveley station" title="Tim and Clare Hale at Staveley station" src="/en/image/61Nk10/360/240/tim-and-clare-hale-at-staveley-station.png" style="width: 360px; height: 240px; float: right;"/>Yesterday, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron put forward an amendment to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill which would legislate to make all UK railway stations meet disability access standards.</p>
<p>Accessibility is a big issue at stations across South Cumbria including at Arnside, Ulverston and Staveley where the only way to the platform is by climbing 41 steep steps.</p>
<p>Speaking during the Levelling Up Bill Committee in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"Because Staveley is a relatively small station, the Government's schemes and funds such as Access for All, as well as those of previous Governments, were never in a million years going to give it any money.</em></p>
<p><em>"In the end, it is outrageous that one of our railway stations - I could also mention Arnside in my constituency and Ulverston in the constituency of my neighbour, the honourable Member for Barrow and Furness - has serious accessibility problems. It is outrageous that just because these are not huge main line stations they are inaccessible for many people in our community.</em></p>
<p><em>"New Clause 66 seeks to prevent the kind of bidding game that we will always lose because the station is too small. It makes it compulsory for there to be direct decent access to railway stations for people with disabilities and other mobility issues."</em></p>
<p>In response, the Levelling Up Minister Lee Rowley said<em>: "I thank the honourable Member for tabling the new clause. I completely accept that access to railway stations - and his particular point about smaller railway stations - is hugely important, and over a long period of time we absolutely must seek to improve accessibility where we are able to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>"This is a policy area that is primarily led by the Department for Transport, but it is none the less in scope. I will highlight some things that I know the hon. Member will be aware of but that are important to put on the record. The DFT has already subsidised nearly £400 million under the Access for All programme, with more due to come beyond 2024. That means that broadly during the period the hon. Gentleman has been in Parliament step-free accessible routes have been delivered at more than 200 stations, and smaller-scale access improvements at more than 1,500 stations.</em></p>
<p><em>"New design standards for accessible railway standards were introduced in 2015, which means that when we intervene at existing railway stations and facilities are installed, renewed or replaced, new standards should be applied. The plan for rail published a year and a half ago, in May 2021, sets out further reforms that seek to transform the railway industry's understanding of the approach to accessibility.</em></p>
<p><em>"Although I completely accept the point that the hon. Member made, and he is absolutely right to have made it, I hope he will consider withdrawing the new clause. While recognising that we have much progress to make, I hope we can make further progress in the coming years."</em></p>
<p>Tim put the amendment to a vote, however it was defeated by 8 votes to 6 with not a single Conservative MP voting in favour.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Regular readers of this column will be aware that I have long been a supporter of Jeremy Hunt. I backed him for the leadership in 2019 and again earlier this summer. It will come as little surprise therefore, that I welcomed his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer last week.</p>

<p>Jeremy is one of the longest serving and most experienced cabinet ministers in the parliamentary Conservative Party. When I served as a Health Minister when he led the Department as Secretary of State, I was impressed by his ability to master his brief and provide calm and rational leadership when faced with challenging circumstances and tough decisions quickly and adeptly.</p>

<p>A core responsibility of Government is to ensure economic stability to allow businesses to make long term investment decisions, for households to be confident that they will be able to meet their outgoings each month and to encourage investment across the country.</p>

<p>While the new Government outlined its plan for growth under the previous Chancellor, it has become clear that market conditions have worsened across the globe. This is most visible to households through the global rise in interest rates affecting bills, mortgage rates and increasing the cost of living. The Treasury under Jeremy Hunt have therefore had to adapt the Government’s strategy.</p>

<p>Growth will remain the central ambition of this Government, but the Chancellor has demonstrated this week that market stability must be secured to fund public spending and deliver sustainable growth.</p>

<p>The Chancellor addressed Parliament on Monday afternoon, outlining the measures he has taken to restore confidence ahead of the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan to be published at the end of the month. No Conservative Member of Parliament wishes to see the tax burden increased, but it is essential that markets have confidence in the Government’s fiscal policy to fund public spending.</p>

<p>Vital reforms and policies to drive growth are firmly on this Government’s agenda:- accelerating infrastructure projects; delivering investment zones; legislating to prevent trade unions from shutting down our national infrastructure; removing burdensome EU bureaucracy from statute; and making it cheaper to buy a new home.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister told MPs at a meeting I attended on Monday evening that she is focussed on delivering the manifesto on which we were elected in 2019.</p>

<p>This is in the context of a very different economic environment, following the global ravages of the Covid pandemic. Governments around the world have increased public debt to keep their economies going. The global economy has also suffered the shocks from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine with soaring energy costs stoking inflation. The UK economy cannot be immune from these pressures.</p>

<p><span>The new Chancellor is the right man for these challenging times. He has already shown from his first decisive days at the Treasury that his decisions are starting to have the desired effect at the time of writing, restoring confidence and settling the financial markets. I look forward to supporting him.</span></p></div>

<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Responding to today’s (Thursday 20th October 2022) resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss, West Dunbartonshire’s MP <strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes said:</strong></p>



<p><em>“In just 45 days, Liz Truss’s disastrous reign in Number 10 has caused economic chaos and hardship across the country.</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s remarkable that the Truss premiership will go down in history as even worse than Boris Johnson’s.</em></p>



<p><em>“Away from this latest circus in Downing Street, my constituents here in West Dunbartonshire are worried about how they’re going to pay their bills.</em></p>



<p><em>“Families across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale are being forced to pay a heavy price for Westminster’s incompetence.</em></p>



<p><em>“Scotland hasn’t voted Conservative in almost 70 years, yet this is the 5th different Tory Prime Minister we’re going to have imposed on us since 2016.</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responding to the news that Liz Truss has resigned, Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After just 44 days in Office, Liz Truss has stepped down as Prime Minister. Her historically brief tenure will be defined by a catastrophic mini-budget which crashed the economy, sent mortgage rates soaring and inflicted more misery on working people already facing a cost-of-living crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear. None of this is acceptable. We have millions on NHS waiting lists, food bank use rising to historic levels, and the Tories swapping leaders around as if it’s all a game. Real people are suffering because of the Tory Party’s inability to govern. It is shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tories have gambled with lives and livelihoods and taken for granted the sacred trust of the British people. They do not have the right to inflict another unelected Prime Minister on the people of Denton and Reddish. It is time for them to step out of the way, and let the Labour Party get on with the business of Governing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough is enough. We need a General Election. Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Llanelli Star Column – The impact of the Tories’ recent decisions on working people</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://niagriffith.org.uk/2022/10/llanelli-star-column-the-impact-of-the-tories-recent-decisions-on-working-people/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Disaster, car crash, calamity.&amp;nbsp; Call it what you
will, the last few weeks has seen the Tory UK Government send our economy into
complete and utter chaos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only weeks into her tenure, our new Prime Minister Liz
Truss in now in office but, most certainly not in power.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Held hostage due to her own arrogant mistakes, it seems
inevitable that the Tories will gang up to replace her with their fifth party
leader in six years.&amp;nbsp; Following the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday,
Jeremy Hunt is now incredibly the fourth Tory Chancellor this year.&amp;nbsp; The
disarray and confusion of this government knows no bounds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, this is a Tory crisis, made in Downing
Street, paid for by working people.&amp;nbsp;They’ve crashed the economy through
enormous unfunded tax cuts, leaving people worried as they face up to higher
mortgages and soaring costs.&amp;nbsp; The Government must re-think this Budget in
full and abandon their discredited, dangerous trickle down approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Tories try to shift blame, it is clear the
market uncertainty the mini Budget unleashed will see&amp;nbsp;working people pay
higher prices and higher mortgage rates for years to come. British households
refinancing a 2-year fixed mortgage will be paying £580 more per month on
average.&amp;nbsp; That will leave many families here in Llanelli in the next few
years with a massive hole in their finances.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new Prime Minister and her Government have embarked
on a radical change of direction that, in many cases, directly contradicts
pledges made in their own manifesto put forward at the last General
Election.&amp;nbsp; They have no democratic mandate to do so and cannot be allowed
to play hard and fast with people’s futures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need a General Election and a change of government
before the Tories do any further damage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TORY U-TURN AND LABOUR ABSTENTION COULD SEE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY BILLS RISE TO £5,000</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/10/19/tory-u-turn-and-labour-abstention-could-see-household-energy-bills-rise-to-5000/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;The SNP has warned struggling households could face bills of up to £5,000 next April, after the Tories performed another screeching U-turn and scrapped protections offered to families on the energy price cap &amp;#8211; and Labour abstained on an SNP amendment that would have prevented this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In scrapping the majority of the proposals contained in the former Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng’s, financial statement, new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a scaling back of the energy price cap freeze, which will now last for only 6 months instead of the two years initially promised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isles MP, Angus MacNeil has branded the decision reckless, warning households face massive energy bill rises again in April 2023.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accusing the Labour party of failing to offer real opposition after their failure to vote against the changes, Angus MacNeil MP said that real support to support households could only come with the full powers of independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting,&amp;nbsp;Angus MacNeil MP&amp;nbsp;said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It can be in no doubt that Scots, who are paying a heavy price for Westminster’s failures, would be better off with the full powers of independence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“On a day where the Scottish Government set out a prospectus offering a brighter economic future the Tory UK government were forced to roll back heavily on its proposals that crashed the UK economy. And with it they recklessly removed the very little protection they offered to households through what is set to be an ever-worsening cost of living crisis the Tories have failed to get a grip of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They were already too late to act on energy bills, and now households face even bigger rises in April when the measly half-baked proposals to help families are scaled back in the latest iteration of Westminster Tory austerity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What’s worse is that, given a chance to stand up for struggling households, the Labour Party once again sat on its hands and refused to offer up real opposition, leaving families in the firing line. There is little difference between the Conservative and Labour parties these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“By contrast, to help with the cost of living crisis the Scottish Government have used their limited powers to uprate eight benefits and bring in further increases to the Scottish Child Payment, but all of that work risks being undone or offset by the calamity ensuing in Westminster. It is clear real support can only come with independence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8220;Scots should no longer be forced to bear the rising cost of Westminster failure and must be able to assume the full powers of independence so they can set out on a different, better path.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Einstein was wrong, it is possible to travel faster than the speed of light. I’m inclined to believe it as I look at the Tories rushing around trying to blame anyone but themselves for the crisis they’ve created.</p>



<p>Jeremy Hunt, the fourth Chancellor since July, is promising to steady the ship by cancelling tax cuts and introducing more austerity. After 12 years of Tory government, it’s back to the future. Working people, the elderly and the poor are going to have to pay for yet another failed experiment.</p>



<p>As we head into winter, it’s almost certain the government won’t honour the triple lock designed to protect pensioners. On Monday, the Chancellor virtually admitted to me that he won’t raise benefits in line with inflation, meaning our poorest pensioners won’t get the increase they need. They’ll get less at the very time when they require more. There won’t be a campaign to encourage almost one million pensioners entitled to pension credit but who don’t claim it. And there’s now no chance of raising the pension credit threshold to allow those living in very modest circumstances to receive a benefit which is also a passport to council tax support, rent assistance and free TV licences for the over 85s.</p>



<p>By promising huge unfunded tax cuts, the new PM spooked the markets. It’s caused a financial crisis which will hit businesses and destroy jobs, drive up mortgages and cost some people their homes. If that’s not bad enough, it’s also created a crisis in government bonds that affects pension funds with a knock-on effect that could hit pensioner incomes for years to come. Pension funds were encouraged to invest in government bonds because they were safe. People who’ve paid pension contributions all their working life trusted those decisions. The reckless actions of this government have put them at risk.</p>



<p>Can you believe the former Chancellor, who behaved like a drunk man in a casino gambling with our money, is now in line for a £17,000 pay off after only 43 disastrous days in the job. It’s time for a change.</p>

<p><strong>Local MP Grant Shapps visited Carter’s Sunflowers Specialist Nursery for children with autism, social communication needs and associated disabilities on Friday. </strong> </p>



<p>Over the course of the visit Mr Shapps heard about the establishment’s achievements and met with parents whose children attend the nursery.</p>



<p>Through its amazing work, Carter’s Sunflowers has helped many parents return to work rather than being a full-time carer – in turn improving their own mental health and wellbeing. </p>



<p>Carter’s Sunflowers supports 26 families in the Welwyn Hatfield and wider Hertfordshire area.</p>



<p>Based in Ludwick Family Club, Welwyn Garden City, the nursery is hoping to expand to provide services for more children in need.</p>



<p>“The feedback from parents today is clear – Carter’s Sunflowers is a unique place for children with specialist needs<a>,”</a> said Mr Shapps.</p>



<p>“The attention to detail from those caring for the children was incredible – I could see that they felt comfortable here”.</p>



<p>“I’m proud to be the local MP for the nursery and will be doing all I can to help find them a larger premisis so they can expand and continue their vital work.”</p>



<p>Lucy Oliveira of Carter’s Sunflowers said “we really appreciate Grant coming along today to find out more about our nursery.</p>



<p>“Having Grant on side to find a larger building is excellent news and we’re grateful for his support<a>.”</a></p>



<p>The organisation also offers special educational needs training and gives confidence to parents that their child is making progress.</p>

    <title>ARTICLE: Communities Need Action Now</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">I often write about supporting families worried about the cost-of-living crisis in these articles. I do so because these issues matter in a big way to local households.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That sometimes means other vital issues don’t make this column but are very important to local residents. One such issue is the poor bus service across the city and the wider area.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be clear: people should have regular and reliable public transport – anything less is unacceptable.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Without drivers, Stagecoach is struggling to keep services moving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is frustrating for you and for them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As much as we understand they cannot fix the national recruitment issue, we can ask for better. That includes communicating effectively with residents about delays and service disruptions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To ease the situation, we also need to improve traffic flow to help services connect more efficiently. That’s why the city needs an urgent agreement reached on the Raigmore Bus Gate and key infrastructure projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue coming up when I speak with local families is the frustrations over local parks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Having a safe place for our children to play in – especially as parents face a cost-of-living crisis – should be a priority for us all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we get it; there is no easy solution.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every community has its own case, and the Council doesn’t have the money to do it all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There might not be an easy answer, but there will be an imperfect one if we preserve together and cut some of the red tape.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot commit seriously to delivering an aspirational vision for the future and not commit to helping fix the issues blighting the city today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">None of us has a magic wand, but we can work together to find innovative ways to improve our amenities and services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We need to be ambitious about the future of our city, and the plans for the future are exciting. To succeed, however, we need to listen to communities now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our passion to deliver a modern green transport system in the future must be equalled by our passion to ensure today’s transport links get folk to and from their jobs and appointments on time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our commitment to build a family-friendly city for the future should be matched by our commitment to ensuring a safe place for your kids to play today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is, after all, the very least our communities should expect.</p>

    <title>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/epsom-and-ewell-energy-support-scheme/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p><strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to you to ask for your help with a new local initiative that I have been working on with <strong>Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell, </strong>the local branch of Citizens Advice and <strong>Good Company</strong> which runs five food bank centres in Epsom and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The current energy crisis is putting huge pressures on many people locally.  Although prices are being frozen for the next two years, and every household will receive a £400 discount on their energy bills this winter, paid over a six month period, many households are still struggling with the increases that have already taken place.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to the crisis is to improve energy efficiency for those who are struggling to pay their bills. But all too often people either do not know what solutions are available or cannot afford them or both.</p>
<p>The <strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong> is a plan to offer those running into difficulties immediate help with their bills, and then advice and financial support to improve energy efficiency or reduce energy consumption in their homes and so reduce bills going forward. This might include buying a more efficient appliance for them or helping with improved insulation.</p>
<p>To help support this programme we are asking local households who have less difficulty paying for these higher energy bills to donate their £400 support payments to the fund so that it can be used to help reduce the bills of those who are struggling. If you are able to do this, we would be very grateful, and all other donations are of course also very welcome.</p>
<p>As I said, the Scheme is being run jointly by the Good Company, which runs the local food bank, and Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell helped by local Churches. It will offer both advice sessions to help those who are not sure how to improve their energy efficiency as well as assistance paying for improvements.</p>
<p>If you can help, I would be very grateful. To make a donation, please visit our donations page at <strong><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qha4CRO3xsv5RPExUNaYzD?domain=justgiving.com">www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></strong>.  If you would like any further information, please drop me an email.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to support this programme.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

    <title>Bust Budget</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/09/27/bust-budget/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>On Friday the new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced what he described as a mini-budget to help deal with the cost of living crisis. The only thing mini about it was the amount of support it provides to the average family and individual in Britain. This completely un-costed budget, will give out the largest tax cuts since 1972, most of which are aimed at the wealthiest in society. That budget in 1972 lead to a short-lived boom, and a much longer bust, with the infamous three-day week and the failure of key services.</p>



<p>The tax cuts in this mini budget, are mainly for the super wealthy, for corporations and for the bankers. The top tax rate of 45p (%) has been completely removed, which is great news for those lucky few that earn over £150,000 a year. Corporation tax increases have been discarded, and the cap on bankers’ bonuses brought in after the financial crisis of 2008 have been scrapped.</p>



<p>But the Tories aren’t content with just giving handouts to the rich, they have also increased the number of Universal Credit recipients who have to actively search for work and attend weekly or fortnightly job centre appointments, if they are working up to 15 hours a week. If they don’t then their benefits will be reduced. Unsurprisingly the mini-budget also attacks trade union rights further, making it harder for working people to strike for the pay and conditions they deserve.</p>



<p>While they have suspended National Insurance increases and cut stamp duty, this support is minute compare to the support for those best off in society. Even in terms of energy bill support, prices being frozen where they are now, simply means they are only twice what they were last year, at the same time that the price for everything else from food to transport is increasing, while wages and benefits remain completely stagnant.</p>



<p>This budget does not serve the needs of the people of Nottingham, it does not help those who need help the most. People earning £20,000 will only save £167 a year. What it will do is drive Britain into an inflationary spiral. It will cause the prices of the goods that residents need to survive to increase further, at a time where benefits and wages are not rising. This will wipe out any gains that residents in the city see from this mini-budget.</p>

<p>The Tories say their budget will stimulate growth; it remains to be seen if it will. What is certain though is that growth in the economy is pointless if it does not lead to increased wages for the average person, if people are not supported to re-skill and obtain jobs in growing sectors, and if people do not have access to suitable affordable housing, whether that’s via home ownership or renting.</p>



<p>The mini budget does nothing to help achieve these aims, Nottingham Labour strongly believe that the budget will not help the people of Nottingham, it will only help a tiny minority of people. A Labour government is needed nationally to give the people of this country and of Nottingham the support and help that they need, and that they deserve.</p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP welcomes the Conservative Government’s Growth Plan, helping two million people across the East Midlands keep more of their hard-earned money</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/09/23/matt-warman-mp-welcomes-the-conservative-governments-growth-plan-helping-two-million-people-across-the-east-midlands-keep-more-of-their-hard-earned-money/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan, starting a new era focused on economic growth, whilst tackling the immediate energy crisis and removing barriers for businesses to build the infrastructure we need to grow the British economy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan puts more money in people’s pockets by cutting National Insurance and Income Tax – including an extra £330 a year from the cut to National Insurance contributions and saving families £1,400 on their energy bills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To deliver on this mission, the Chancellor has also announced 38 Investment Zones and over 100 infrastructure projects across the country to drive the investment and growth in the areas that need it the most.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan – setting out support for families with their energy bills and unleashing a new era of growth through tax cuts and investment incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Warman MP has welcomed the Chancellor’s measures set out for families across Boston and Skegness who will have their energy bills cut by up to £1,400 through the Energy Price Guarantee, whilst businesses eligible for The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will have their energy bills slashed by cutting the price of wholesale gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor also confirmed people across the East Midlands will benefit from personal tax cuts – cutting National Insurance contributions by 1.25 per cent, putting an extra £330 a year in people’s pockets and helping them with cost-of-living pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means two million people across the East Midlands region will save £255 a year thanks to the cut to National Insurance contributions, and 2.4 million people across the East Midlands will save £160 a year thanks to the slash to Income tax in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside these measures the Conservative Government announced further personal cuts – including cutting stamp duty permanently by doubling the nil-rate band to £250,000 (from £125,000), increasing the nil-rate band for first time buyers to £425,000 (from £300,000) and increasing the value of the property which first-time buyers can claim relief to £625,000 from (£500,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures combined mean a typical family moving into a semi-detached property will save £2,500 on stamp duty and £1,150 on energy bills – and if they have a combined income of £50,000 around an additional £560 on tax. This is around £4,200 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan also unleashes 38 Investment Zones across England, unlocking housing and driving growth through tax incentives and over 100 infrastructure projects that will be accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures will unleash growth through tax cuts and reform, tackle the immediate energy crisis, removing barriers for business, and building the infrastructure needed to grow the British economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Matt Warman MP said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“In the face of rising energy prices and cost of living pressures it is right that this Conservative Government has come forward with a serious support package and a plan for growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I welcome support set out for people across Boston and Skegness today, including cuts to National Insurance contributions, Income Tax and Stamp Duty – all helping families to keep more of their hard-earned money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Only the Conservatives can be trusted to make the reforms we need to grow our economy – delivering higher wages, lower taxes and more money for our public services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Growth is not as high as it should be. This has made it harder to pay for public services, requiring taxes to rise and cost of living pressures to increase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We need to change this and be unashamed in our Growth Plan – expanding the supply side of the economy, through tax incentives and reform, whilst we help families now by cutting their energy bills by £1,400 a year and slashing personal taxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That is how we will deliver higher wages, greater opportunities, and crucially, fund public services, now and into the future.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guide to Google Classroom distance learning in 2022</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/guide-to-google-classroom-distance-learning-in-2022/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It’s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it’s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren’t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one’s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn’t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they’re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we’ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don’t have face-to-face access to students. It’s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it’s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let’s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
