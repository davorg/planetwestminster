    <title>My speech during the debate on Official Development Assistance and the British Council</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I support the Government’s estimate and I look forward to its passage. I also back the Government’s judgment at this very difficult time, when so many economies, including our own, have been badly damaged by responses to the pandemic. But I also understand the mood of the House and I understand that a number of my hon. and right hon. Friends whom I respect have misgivings about all this. I would just like to make a few remarks in the spirit of trying to build some bridges between the Government and their critics, who have been very wide-ranging in this debate.</p>
<p>The first point I make is that I do not trust the figures. I think that the Government understate just how much we already do and how much we already spend. We are much more cautious about what we regard as aid expenditure than some other countries we are compared against, even though we usually spend more than they do as a percentage.</p>
<p>Let us take, for example, an area that colleagues have already mentioned. This country has received a very large number of economic migrants and asylum seekers in recent years. In the year to March 2020, the last for which we have official figures, 715,000 people came to live in our country, and many of them came from poor countries that have qualified for overseas aid. We do not fully account, in the way that one might, for the first-year set-up costs—the housing, the public service provision, the top-up benefits and the other assistance that people are rightfully given when they come to live with us and we wish them to live to a reasonable standard. Surely, helping people who wish to come here because they find their own countries so disadvantageous is a very important part of our overseas aid.</p>
<p>We are also too cautious about all the expenditure we make through the Ministry of Defence. Why were we in Afghanistan? Afghanistan is one of the main recipients of our aid, and in recent years we have been spending considerable sums of money on support through our military and the advice we offer. Those things should also be taken into account to get a realistic picture of just how much the Government are spending on necessary assistance abroad.</p>
<p>The second issue that has been raised in the debate is that colleagues fear a loss of influence. I would like to reassure them that surely this year, of all years, is when we have seen a major advance in British influence. We have just taken our full seat with a vote on the World Trade Organisation, and we are busily signing off a number of trade agreements around the world that we could not have done in previous years. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister has just very successfully chaired the G7 and has helped to bring together the seven most powerful western democracies in terms of economic strength to reach important agreements to improve the world outlook. We have COP26 coming up, when I trust that British chairmanship will be astute and helpful in order to agree something that many Governments in the world talk a lot about, though not all of them do as much as we do to try and see things through. We are very much the second most important member of NATO in terms of contribution after the United States of America, and we are a force within NATO to make sure that it is used for the good, as a force for peace.</p>
<p>On the 0.7% target, I make no secret of the fact that I do not like targets like that. I did not feel at the time it went through that there was any point in trying to persuade Parliament because Parliament was very hooked on such a target. The difficulty with a target like that is, as we have seen, that national income can change quite rapidly in ways that people did not predict—if something like a pandemic strikes, in particular—and it is not always possible, when we get the recovery, to build up the spending as quickly as the GNI, and it would be silly to have to spend money when we do not have really good projects.</p>
<p>Nor do I like the idea of Governments passing legislation to bind themselves. It seems to me completely pointless. What matters is the word of the Government. If circumstances change, they may have to change, and all the time that the Government control a majority, the fact that it is in legislation does not make any difference. The Government still have to decide whether to keep their word or whether force majeure or force of circumstance requires some temporary or permanent change.</p>
<p>In this debate, I think lots of colleagues have all decided to duplicate and replicate one another’s speeches by saying how much they dislike any kind of cut in our immediate aid programme. I would like to have heard, from all those who are understandably enthusiastic about the good that aid could do, rather more discussion of what works best when we have limited money—as we always will, whether the limit is 0.5% or 0.7% of our GDP—so that we can do the most good with it. We have had several years of 0.7% but we still have the same list of main countries needing aid, so we know that this is not a simple fix, that we are one of many and that we need to work with other partners around the world. We need to harness the private sector and the charitable sector; it does not all have to come from British taxpayers.</p>
<p>When we are looking at progress, we first need to establish a peace. Quite a lot of the countries that need a lot of aid still do not have a peace; they have a civil war going on. That means that any particular projects may just be damaged or wasted because of the lack of that fundamental condition. It is best if there is a decent Government who can deliver and who are not corrupt. To what extent are we allowed to try to influence Governments in the right direction, because we do not wish to become a neo-colonial power?</p>
<p>We need to harness the private sector more so that the money that our taxpayers and other advanced countries’ taxpayers put in is multiplied several times by getting that investment in the water systems, the communications systems or the food systems that are needed, which should come more from commercial work. Above all, I think our message should be that trade is often more effective as a means of promoting economic growth and prosperity than aid. We, above all, should believe that, now that we are leading advocates of freer trade around the world and back there in the WTO. Is it not much better that we help to offer contracts to people who can organise economic activity, which creates better-paid jobs and things to do, rather than just having one-off amounts of aid to ease the particular problems of not having a decent economy?</p>
<p>This year, above all, surely is the year when Britain can be truly proud of its achievements in this area, because, thanks to our scientists, the NHS and the Government, we are giving to the world the cheapest vaccine, the one non-profit vaccine—often a free vaccine, because our taxpayers are standing behind that offer. This surely sums up the generosity of spirit of the British people, and the success of the British economy and our world influence: that it will be a British vaccine that is so often deployed, and that it was a British vaccine at the heart of the Prime Minister’s successful negotiations at the G7 to get other rich countries to get on with the task of vaccinating the world.</p>

    <title>Christina Rees MP presses the Prime Minister about shocking failures to protect employee safety at the Swansea DVLA site</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/christina-rees-mp-presses-the-prime-minister-about-shocking-failures-to-protect-employee-safety-at-the-swansea-dvla-site/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, pressed the Prime Minister about the ongoing health and safety failures at the DVLA during PMQs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rees asked the Prime Minister why it was deemed acceptable to return over 450 staff to the Swansea site, contrary to UK Government advice, as cases are significantly rising in South Wales.  The DVLA has been subject to multiple Covid outbreaks throughout the pandemic, with staff taking industrial action in protest of the poor Covid safety measures and refusals to allow them to work from home.</p>
<p>An agreement had been reached between the PCS Union representing staff, the senior management and the Department for Transport, but was retracted at the last minute in an unprecedented late-stage development. With cases rising again, it is feared another outbreak at the site could be on the horizon if the Department of Transport do not cooperate with the PCS Union and come to an agreement.</p>
<p>Christina Rees also highlighted the online abuse and bullying that PCS Union representative at the DVLA, Sarah Evans, has been facing this week as a result of standing up for staff safety. The DVLA are refusing to remove references on the social media sites to an online petition that includes threats to the safety of the rep, with some DVLA managers even sharing the abuse online.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, said: </strong></p>
<p>“Constituents in Neath are right to be angered by the disregard for the safety of DVLA staff and the disgusting treatment online of one of their PCS Union reps.  It is shocking that the DVLA are refusing to act to take down this online abuse, including a petition containing threats to the rep’s safety.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that the Department for Transport works cooperatively with PCS Union representatives to come to an agreement that puts staff safety first.  Staff need to be properly protected against further potential outbreaks by making allowances for home working and the provision of additional safety measures onsite for those who need to go in.</p>
<p>“This dispute has gone on for long enough.  DVLA staff deserve to be treated with respect by the UK Government and senior staff, and I will continue to work with the PCS Union to bring the negotiators back to the table.”</p>

  <summary type="text">Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has slammed a Conservative cabinet minister who described local farmers as 'feeble'.
Over the last couple of weeks, the Government has been widely criticised for allowing British farmers to be undercut in their new trade deal with Australia.

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has slammed a Conservative cabinet minister who described local farmers as 'feeble'.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, the Government has been widely criticised for allowing British farmers to be undercut in their new trade deal with Australia.</p>
<p>But in the House of Commons this morning, the Leader of the House Jacob-Rees Mogg described farmers with concerns over the trade deal as "feeble and frightened".</p>
<p>Speaking during Business Questions this morning, Tim said: <em>"The Leader of the House will be proud as I am of the high animal welfare and environmental standards of British farmers, but the Australian trade deal looks likely to betray our farmers by allowing lower standard Australian farm produce to undercut them.</em></p>
<p><em>"Given that this deal will set a precedent for every subsequent trade deal, will he allow time for MPs to debate it as was done over the Japan deal last November when his Right Honourable Friend the International Trade Secretary said that this was and I quote 'the first of many debates about negotiated trade deals'.</em></p>
<p><em>"Will he keep faith with British farmers and will he keep the promise made by his Right Honourable Friend?"</em></p>
<p>In response, Jacob Rees-Mogg refused to give any assurances that the trade deal would be debated in Parliament and instead claimed that Australian farmers have "high standards of animal welfare" and derided concerned local farmers as "frightened, nervy and feeble".</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim said: <em>"Jacob Rees-Mogg's outrageous comments about our hard-working farmers just show how little the Conservatives care about rural communities.</em></p>
<p><em>"It is Mr Rees-Mogg's own Conservative Government that is cutting support payments to local farmers, actively encouraging farmers to leave the industry with no idea who will replace them, failing to intervene to save Newton Rigg agricultural college and threatening the future of family farms with their Australian trade deal."</em></p>

    <title>Chi hails ‘huge victory’ on steel safeguards</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/07/chi-hails-huge-victory-on-steel-safeguards/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi Onwurah MP hails ‘huge victory’ on steel safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Onwurah has praised steel workers and manufacturers across the North East for helping to force a last-minute government u-turn on Wednesday over the removal of safeguard tariffs on cheap imports of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on recommendations from the independent Trade Remedies Authority, the government was set to remove nine of the 19 current import safeguards on different steel products at midnight on 30th June. At a time when other countries were renewing their safeguards, that raised fears that the UK market would be flooded with cheap steel imports, threatening the viability of UK steel production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers at steel works across the North East had joined thousands more across the country in demanding the retention of the safeguards, and Chi Onwurah helped lead opposition to the government’s plans in Parliament. On 21st June, Chi spoke in a debate forced by the Labour Party, and told government ministers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;our national interest demands a sovereign steel capability&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;ideologically puritanical free trade does not work for a sector such as steel, and is at the heart of the Government’s betrayal of the steel industr&lt;/strong&gt;y.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Why is it that our Government wants to sell our steelworkers out to China and preside over a race to the bottom&lt;/strong&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With five hours to go until the deadline on 30th June, the government announced that the five most important safeguards under threat would be extended for a further year, and that the decision-making powers of the Trade Remedies Authority would be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the announcement, Chi Onwurah said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is a huge victory for steel workers and manufacturers across the North East, who have campaigned so hard over the last month against the removal of these safeguards. Their efforts helped me and other MPs to make the case in Parliament, force the government to change its plans, and keep these protections in place.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But the fight does not stop here. As a first step, I will be demanding as part of the government’s review that the Trade Remedies Authority is reformed to represent the views of workers and industry, and consider the impact of its decisions on communities like ours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“And second, we may have stopped the immediate threat from cheap imports, but we have to do more than that to protect the future of the British steel industry. We need a long-term plan for investment and modernisation, making the UK a world leader in low carbon steel production and putting British-made steel at the heart of every major infrastructure project in our country&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes for Editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The government’s announcement on the safeguards was made via a written statement to Parliament, which can be read here: &lt;a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-06-30/hcws136"&gt;https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-06-30/hcws136&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) UK Steel, the official group representing the UK’s steel producers, have also welcomed the government’s announcement, saying: “[This] will prevent an anticipated wave of overseas steel flooding our market, that would have cost jobs, investment, and our ability to decarbonise as a sector, threatening the UK’s road to net-zero. To have removed steel import restrictions&amp;#8230;would have cost the sector hundreds of millions per year, as a result of increased import penetration and reduced market share for UK producers. This cost would be equivalent to 50% of the annual capital investment of steel producers, or 2,500 employees &amp;#8211; 8% of the total employment in the sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has today marked the start of Sarcoma Awareness Month by pledging his support to a campaign calling for the rare but devastating cancer to be given more specialist research funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcomas are a group of rare but devastating cancers of the soft tissue and bones. Sarcoma is often referred to as &amp;#8216;The Loneliest Cancer&amp;#8217; due to it&amp;#8217;s rarity and lack of accurate diagnosis and treatments. 15 people are diagnosed with Sarcoma every day, and of those 15 only half will survive for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of sarcoma include a lump that cannot easily be moved around and bone pain. If you are exhibiting one or more of those symptoms you should see your GP immediately to have your symptoms checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcoma Awareness Month is organised by the charity Sarcoma UK. In 2011, the Sarcoma Trust and Sarcoma UK joined to become a new single charity for sarcoma patients, carers and relatives in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years on and Sarcoma UK has invested more than £4.3 million into scientific and medical research; supported almost 2,500 people through the Sarcoma UK Support Line, and worked with national governing bodies, sarcoma specialist centres and organisations to advocate for better and earlier treatments for people affected by sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking at the start of Sarcoma Awareness Month, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8221;Sarcoma is such a devastating disease, but is often overlooked and ignored. That needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see increased funding earmarked for specialist sarcoma care and research, and need to make sure that people are aware of how to spot the early signs of sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catching cancer early is the best way to have a positive outcome. I would urge anyone who has bone pain or a lump anywhere on the body which is increasing in size to contact their GP immediately.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information on sarcoma visit the Sarcoma UK website &lt;a href="https://sarcoma.org.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now Stephen McPartland MP has joined with Bedwell Rangers FC to launch a taskforce to find them a permanent home in the town and a new 3G synthetic pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen McPartland MP, said, “The FA have stated that Stevenage is three pitches short of 3G pitches and at £750,000 a pitch, they do not come cheap. We have established this taskforce to find the club a permanent home and will be asking Stevenage Borough Council to join us. We are keen to work with them to help find a permanent home and also put a bid into the Government’s Levelling Up Fund to pay for a new 3G pitch. By working together, we can build a base for Bedwell Rangers that will allow us to access funding from a variety of sources and help support more children. I will be working closely with Neil and the team at Bedwell Rangers and contacting Stevenage Borough Council to work on the bid too.”&lt;/p&gt;

Neil said, “With over 650 children currently participating in the club and more on waiting lists, Bedwell Rangers are at a point where we are struggling for locations to train and capacity to take on more children that are desperate to get involved. Children have endured an incredibly tough year with the pandemic. Mental health issues are on the rise and we feel it is vital, now more than ever, that we can secure facilities that will allow Bedwell Rangers to help more children.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Graham Stuart MP joins forces with Sir Greg Knight MP to tackle flooded farmland</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grahamstuart.com/2021/07/graham-stuart-mp-joins-forces-with-sir-greg-knight-mp-to-tackle-flooded-farmland/farmers-and-flooding-june-21/" rel="attachment wp-att-11521"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11521" src="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Farmers-and-Flooding-June-21-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" srcset="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Farmers-and-Flooding-June-21-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Farmers-and-Flooding-June-21-740x408.jpg 740w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Farmers-and-Flooding-June-21.jpg 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, chaired a further virtual meeting with local farmers and representatives from the Environment Agency (EA), East Riding Council (ERYC) and the National Farmers Union (NFU) to follow up on the discussion they had in April about flooded farmland. Graham was joined by Sir Greg Knight, Chairman of Hull River Board and a neighbouring MP, whose farmers are similarly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency reported on the River Hull bathymetric Survey, which had highlighted a number of focus areas for more investigation and which will become the subject of bids for Government funding. Farmers welcomed the further opportunity to raise their continuing concerns and individual experiences, and to put questions to the EA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was concluded that once a clear proposal is put together, the group will be in a position to make a strong case to various private and public bodies to secure funding. Graham looks forward to chairing another follow up meeting in September to hear an update from the EA about their assessments, solutions and costings, so that next steps can be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grahamstuart.com/2021/04/graham-stuart-mp-chairs-meeting-with-environment-agency-about-flooded-farmland/flooding-at-lakes-farm-scorborough-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-11320"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11320" src="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flooding-at-Lakes-Farm-Scorborough-2-300x400.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flooding-at-Lakes-Farm-Scorborough-2-300x400.jpg 300w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flooding-at-Lakes-Farm-Scorborough-2-740x987.jpg 740w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flooding-at-Lakes-Farm-Scorborough-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flooding-at-Lakes-Farm-Scorborough-2-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Flooding-at-Lakes-Farm-Scorborough-2-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham said, “We had a really successful meeting and it is clear that a joint approach is the best way forward. I was delighted to be joined by Sir Greg and farmers in his constituency to help drive momentum on the importance of reducing the effects of flooding that local farmers have been experiencing for several years. I look forward to reconvening in September when I hope we can make real progress and solidify our next steps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir Greg said, “Clearly more needs to be done and Graham and I are keen to ensure that a coordinated approach is pursued so that all options to reduce flooding locally are properly examined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Stockhill, Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager at the EA, said “We were grateful to have the opportunity to share the findings from our survey of the River Hull. There are some locations we want to look into further, where we can see ‘humps’ in the river bed level. We will conduct further sampling, to establish if these are a result of silt build up, or natural features such as chalk and rock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to share the results of our findings in this forum, as we collectively gain a better understanding about this complex water network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It remains important to recognise the funding challenges faced in investing in low lying, drained areas like the upper River Hull. We welcome Graham’s work in helping bring together communities and partners, which will be crucial if any work is to be progressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Duggleby, who farms at Beswick, said, “I am very grateful for our two local MPs, Sir Greg Knight and Graham Stuart, being so supportive of our case for procuring extra funds from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – the upper Hull is in a desperate state.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It was fun while it lasted, wasn’t it – watching Scotland at the finals of football’s European championship?</p>
<p>There was unity and hope as we willed on the young Scotland squad to victory – a rollercoaster of emotions played out in homes in every village, town and city across the country. With flags and bunting at every turn, young and old doning on their Scotland tops to show their support and businesses offering their unique Scotland EURO products; there was certainly plenty to celebrate. After such a challenging year, we showed our support for our national team as one community filled with pride and hope. While we didn’t quite get to the dizzying heights of the knockout phases, most of us watching will be pleased with the progress, in terms of the emerging talent and the look, of a team that will deliver in time. The hope lives on and roll on the next tournament.</p>
<p>Away from the football, back in parliament, my SNP colleagues and I have been working to protect our businesses and communities from further harm by Boris Johnson’s Global Britain Brexit mess.</p>
<p>The impacts of Brexit have been manifesting locally for some time, and the situation is only getting worse. Businesses across this constituency have reported dramatic falls in exporting, with orders from the EU disappearing entirely in some instances. Since Brexit, there has been a 33% drop in trade with the EU – this is real money lost to businesses who already face increased costs to work with the EU. Colossal new shipping charges, reams of paperwork and higher raw material costs are just some of the new burdens businesses are grappling with as part of post-Brexit Britain. The continued negligence from this UK Government means the situation is only going to get worse. In the past few months alone, our fishing, farming industry, and crofting communities join the list of sectors sold down the river.</p>
<p>Instead of working with others to sort out the issues of their making, Ministers are spending time chasing trade deals to support their narrative and spin – searching for the next big headline. Any trade deal will do; no cost seems too high to pay. Their latest deal with Australia can’t even scratch the surface of the losses businesses are already experiencing.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most visible impact here in the Strath has been on staffing. My office is taking increasingly desperate calls from hotels, restaurants and tourism businesses struggling to keep their doors open because of the staffing crisis they face. As readers will know, EU nationals have long made a valuable contribution to our workforce and our communities. The vile Brexit narrative and this Tory government’s commitment to a hostile immigration policy has understandably made the UK an unattractive place to come and work.</p>
<p>This, coupled with the ongoing housing situation across our communities, has created a staffing crisis without an easy solution. There isn’t a single answer to the problem, but it is clear that a new approach is needed. To solve this problem, we will need a collective will to change. I am committed to working with you all to tackle this crisis. It cannot be that families cannot afford to live in our communities because – if this does continue, there will be no community left.</p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP calls for a Building Works Agency to protect leaseholders from footing the bill for remediation works</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/30/karin-smyth-mp-calls-for-a-building-works-agency-to-protect-leaseholders-from-footing-the-bill-for-remediation-works/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=karin-smyth-mp-calls-for-a-building-works-agency-to-protect-leaseholders-from-footing-the-bill-for-remediation-works" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is calling on the Government to establish a new Building Works Agency. This proposed agency (consisting of government appointed engineers and experts) would be in directly charge of resolving the cladding crisis going block by block; assessing the problems; commissioning remediation works; paying for them and signing off buildings as safe and sellable so that leaseholders can get on with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follow years of failed promises by the Government to make buildings safe and protect leaseholders from the crippling costs of remediation works. Hundreds of thousands of people are still living in unsafe blocks of flats four years on from the tragic Grenfell fire and millions caught up in the wider building safety crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for the Building Safety Fund on 30th June is set to be missed, and as it stands only 10p in every £1 of the Building Safety Fund has been allocated. Working at this rate it would take until 2028 to fully allocate the fund. A tough new approach is needed quickly. As well as establishing the extent of dangerous cladding and prioritising them according to risk, a body of experts is needed to actually commission the works and pay for them using the existing Building Safety Fund so that this money doesn’t go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For too long Government Ministers have buried their heads in the sand: dithering and delaying on an issue which requires urgent action. I have constituents living in dangerous leaseholder properties in Bedminster who are rightly furious with the Government for repeatedly betraying the promise that they would not be responsible for the financial cost of rectifying building safety defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is disgraceful that leaseholders are bearing the burdens of costs when the Building Safety Fund is laying largely untouched. Labour’s proposal for a Building Works Agency is the kind of action we need to take control of the crisis. It will be a body that can commission and pay for the works urgently needed to carried out on unsafe buildings and ensure they are paid for using the Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This crisis will never be resolved if the Government carries on breaking promises and shifting blame. A tough new approach is needed to safeguard lives and livelihoods.”&lt;/p&gt;The post &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/30/karin-smyth-mp-calls-for-a-building-works-agency-to-protect-leaseholders-from-footing-the-bill-for-remediation-works/"&gt;Karin Smyth MP calls for a Building Works Agency to protect leaseholders from footing the bill for remediation works&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com"&gt;Karin Smyth&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

					<content type="html" xml:base="http://johnpenrose.org/wp/2021/06/30/weston-mercury-whatever-your-politics-may-be-boundary-changes-are-good-news-for-democracy/"><![CDATA[
<p>Political reactions to the suggested new Parliamentary Boundaries are usually guaranteed to turn anyone into a cynic. Broadly, people who think it might help them win the next election are in favour, while anyone who thinks it hurts their chances ritually denounces the entire exercise as unfair and wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the truth then? Well, firstly, the review is done by the&nbsp;Boundary&nbsp;Commission, a completely independent and impartial public body. They don&#8217;t care whether their proposed&nbsp;changes&nbsp;make a seat easier or harder for any political party to win. Rather, they want the system to be as democratically fair as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that in mind, did you know that your vote at the last general election was worth more than somebody who lives in Taunton, but less than somebody else living east of Bristol? It’s because the current Parliamentary boundaries are so outdated that in some places it takes just 40,000 people to elect an MP to Westminster while in others it takes over 90,000. As a result, people in bigger constituencies have votes that count less than those in smaller ones.</p>



<p>That said, this talk of carving up the existing boundaries tugs on the heart strings. Any&nbsp;change&nbsp;will be a bitter pill to swallow, because I&#8217;ve knocked on doors to have conversations with thousands of local people over the years and been involved in campaigns across each and every area of the current constituency; from Weston to Blagdon,&nbsp;covering topics from High Street&nbsp;regeneration to stopping pylons ruining rural views and habitats.</p>



<p>So any&nbsp;change&nbsp;will be difficult, whatever the final proposals turn out to be. But at least the final result will be fairer, and more democratic as a result. Whatever your politics may be, that’s got to be good news.</p>

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>In a letter to the Building Safety Minister, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, has asked whether the Government plans to fully address the building safety scandal given the Building Safety Fund (BSF), designed to fund remediation works for unsafe buildings, excludes many fire safety faults. </p>
<p>In her letter, Gill challenges the Government over omissions in its building safety plans which could leave many homes unsafe and unsellable even after works have been completed, as well as blameless leaseholders with multi-million-pound bills to complete the job. </p>
<p>Gill warns that four years on from the Grenfell tragedy, Government plans to fix the cladding scandal face further delays due to “roadblocks of its own design”. She says: “Leaseholders can’t be expected to live in unsafe conditions in homes that have been rendered uninsurable and unsellable due to fire risks for which they bear no blame.” </p>
<p>The Government has previously stated on multiple occasions that leaseholders would not be made to pay for this crisis. However, despite extensive lobbying, its Building Safety Fund excludes many fire safety faults from eligibility for funding, such as defects with balconies, insulation, and fire breaks. The Government has warned that remediation works must be ready to start on site by 30th September 2021 or risk losing funding.   </p>
<p>Gill asks if Government “would expect applicants to move forward with partial remediation projects that do not address the full gamut of fire safety faults that have been identified, despite this undoubtedly inflating overall costs, or would MHCLG withhold funding until on site work is able to begin in full?”  </p>
<p>With a long list of questions, much still unknown to thousands of anxious leaseholders and lives at risk, Ms Gill hopes to see more urgency as well as clear responses from Government. </p>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the Government statement on security arrangements relating to ministerial offices and communications Philip Dunne raises concerns about sensors being used to eavesdrop on Ministers, and others who work in Government buildings, without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like my good and hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Steve Brine), I joined the Department of Health in moving into this new building, 39 Victoria Street, at the end of 2017. Will the Minister ask the Department to consider in its internal investigation whether the devices were installed as part of the new build or subsequently? Will she also please develop a protocol from the Cabinet Office across Government that all Ministers, and frankly all people working in Government buildings, are notified of any official listening, visual or other sensors in their place of work, so that they are aware of it rather than, as we have been today, surprised by it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=4647"&gt;Julia Lopez (The Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are very pertinent questions, and ones that I have asked in advance of today and to which we will all want answers. My right hon. Friend makes an important and useful suggestion when it comes to the protocol in relation to CCTV or any other device that might be found in a Minister’s office. I am sure that other Ministers across Government will want that assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-06-28/debates/7ac646ea-f041-4df7-a179-514e8f85fb8d/CommonsChamber#contribution-DCEBF842-23CE-4884-B8D8-6A29FB9C417B"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Black Country Core Strategy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/black-country-core-strategy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>At the end of last week the Black Country Core Strategy was published. <strong>The proposed plan has left me shocked at the sheer scale of development being proposed for my constituency. </strong></p>
<p>At its heart the proposal <u>should</u> have been looking at viable opportunities to provide housing and employment across our communities on appropriate local sites.</p>
<p>Instead, the proposal simply seeks to drive a coach and horses through the green lungs of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>
<p><strong>The proposed development on our precious Green Belt is unacceptable to me and I know from the many emails that I have already received on this matter that it is unacceptable to you too.</strong></p>
<p>I am still of the firm belief that there are an adequate number of brownfield sites across the Black Country which should be developed first instead of forging ahead with the wholesale destruction of our  Green Belt and Open Spaces.</p>
<p>That’s why I will be questioning the housing allocation numbers and asking why it is that my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and the wider Walsall area are being expected to do the heavy lifting and why we are being asked to take a disproportionate number of houses.</p>
<p>Whilst at this stage the Black Country Plan is only a ‘proposal, it remains extremely important that when the consultation starts in August we all feed in our views.</p>
<p>When I have further information about the consultation I will update you all.</p>
<p>However, please be assured that I will be opposing this plan on behalf of the residents of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">In the recent Queen’s Speech, the Government formally announced their plans to introduce mandatory Voter ID at the next election. This policy requires voters to present photo ID to vote at polling stations in future elections.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Labour have called on the Government to urgently rethink the policy, raising concerns that the policy will reverse decades of democratic progress and threaten to bar millions of people from exercising their democratic right to vote.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Since this policy was first announced in December 2016, the Government has received multiple warnings from charities, civil society figures and campaign groups that mandatory voter ID – if rolled out nationally - could pull up the drawbridge for millions of voters.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> <em>“Millions of people lack photo ID in this country - in particular the elderly, low income and Black, Asian and ethnic minority voters. The Conservatives are reversing decades of democratic progress and urgently need to rethink this pointless policy. In the coming weeks I will be carrying out a survey to find out what my constituents think about these plans. The reality is that the Tories are attempting to price people out of democracy and it is a disgrace.”</em></p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of joining campaigners outside of Parliament for the Travel Day of Action, fighting against the Government’s handling of covid travel restrictions.</p>



<p>I met with South Shields based travel agent, Graeme Brett, owner of Westoe Travel to discuss the ongoing challenges facing the travel industry. Graeme attended alongside a wide range of organisations from across the aviation and travel industries aiming to put pressure on the Government to support a safe return to international travel in time for the peak summer period.</p>



<p>The travel industry has been let down badly throughout the pandemic and the Government must provide sector-specific support and finance to all those affected. No other industry has been left in the dark like this and we’re going to see more and more travel agencies getting boarded up and people losing their jobs if we don’t act.</p>



<p>I believe the current traffic light system doesn’t work, it sends unclear messages to both business and travellers. With the promotion of clear and consistent public health messages and good measures in place, international travel could return.</p>



<p>Last week I voted against the extension of the covid roadmap restrictions. The virus will be with us for the long haul and repeated lockdowns and constant restrictions is not a long-term strategy. I believe we need to make a start reopening safe international travel and reap the benefits of our country’s vaccination programme.</p>



<p>For all who have lost their jobs and are fighting to re-open travel, I will continue to fight with you.</p>

    <title>Scalpay back online after community call in MP for help</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/06/23/scalpay-back-online-after-community-call-in-mp-for-help/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Residents on Scalpay are back online after nearly two months of service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scalpay Community Council contacted Angus MacNeil MP to alert him to the disruption faced by around 20 households who were affected by an ongoing broadband problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disruption to service was causing problems for those working from home due to Covid-19 restrictions and for local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kenny Macleod, Secretary of Scalpay Community Council, and one of those affected, said: “After weeks of being given different stories and being told it was fixed, we got in touch with our MP, Mr MacNeil, and are very grateful for his intervention which has undoubtedly speeded up the resolution of our problems.&amp;nbsp; If he hadn’t intervened and got the engineers onto the ferry, we would probably still be waiting for it to be fixed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are all hugely dependant on a good, reliable internet connection and not having it for so long caused lots of problems. Hopefully now these are resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil had contacted Openreach to try to push forward a solution and was very pleased when it was confirmed to him that a team was set to travel to the island imminently to work on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openreach then contacted Mr MacNeil for assistance due to the difficulties they were facing in securing a ferry booking to the island and Mr MacNeil then contacted Calmac to stress the urgency of the situation and a ferry booking was made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team carried out works and although not all issues have been overcome, households have now been reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The engineers replaced the dishes on the 18Ghz radio link at both ends, but they are still waiting on parts for the 32g link which need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional works are due to be carried out to increase speeds when parts arrive, however Openreach state there are no live faults in this area and services are now operating as normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openreach are also looking at providing additional weatherproofing to try and stop the problems occurring again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased that I was able to assist the community on Scalpay in moving towards a resolution to this problem which was causing disruption to everyday life and was understandably frustrating for residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I cannot fix all problems which constituents raise with me, but I would encourage people to get in touch and I will do all I can to assist.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tories must be stopped from selling out our steel industry</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://niagriffith.org.uk/2021/06/tories-must-be-stopped-from-selling-out-our-steel-industry/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Later today, Labour will try to stop the Tories selling
out the British steel industry by forcing a decision to retain vital
protections, with a motion to Parliament empowering Keir Starmer to put forward
emergency legislation to extend the UK’s current safeguards against cheap steel
imports.&amp;nbsp; I will be voting in favour of this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before 30 June, the Tory International Trade Secretary
will decide whether to push&amp;nbsp;ahead with plans&amp;nbsp;to remove nine of the
current 19 safeguards. The EU has extended its own&amp;nbsp;steel&amp;nbsp;safeguards
until at least June 2024, and the US is also expected to do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risks for the UK’s steel industry are great if the
Tories press on. There is a surplus of&amp;nbsp;steel&amp;nbsp;in China and the excess
of&amp;nbsp;steel&amp;nbsp;on the international market has pushed prices down. If
safeguards are removed, the UK’s&amp;nbsp;steel&amp;nbsp;industry faces being dwarfed
by competitors. Just a 2% increase in global overproduction could totally wipe
out demand for British&amp;nbsp;steel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slashing safeguards and opening the floodgates to cheap
steel imports would be devastating for steel plants across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s great to be back on constituency days again. Being out and about in the constituency.</p>
<p>“Meeting people, visiting schools is vital work for any constituency MP and frankly the kind of thing which has been really difficult to do during COVID. It’s just not the same when you’re on a Zoom video- fantastic to be back out in person.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr Shapps’ first visited recently painted murals in subways by the station in Hatfield.</p>
<p>Two pedestrian subways in Hatfield have been transformed into works of art, to provide safe and attractive walking and cycling routes between Hatfield Station and Hatfield House.</p>
<p>Badgers, butterflies, balloons, and bicycles are just some of the colourful new images to be seen in the transformed subways, along with murals celebrating Hatfield’s role in the development of the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>The improvements to the subways have been undertaken by Hertfordshire County Council in partnership with Network Rail and supported by Hatfield House and the local community. The redecoration is part of a programme of works to brighten and improve pedestrian subways across Hertfordshire to make walking and cycling more attractive options for residents.</p></div>

<p>It supports something I’ve been saying for a long time- if you want people to active travel, their surroundings need to be pleasant, and well looked after. I’ve cycled through these subways quite a lot and I’ve got to say they’re looking so much better. My congratulations to all involved.”</p>
<p>Phil Bibby, Herts County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport, said: “Improving these subways in Hatfield is part of a wider programme to encourage active travel and reduce car use across the county.</p>
<p>Walking and cycling have so many direct benefits to both physical and mental health, and if everyone made a few more journeys on foot or bike, and a few less in the car, that would have a big impact on air quality, and therefore on everyone’s health. That’s why improving routes like these is so important to us.”</p>
<p>Next stop for Mr Shapps was Stanborough School in Welwyn Garden City, where he met with Headteacher Merry John to tour the school, check on its progress, and open a newly completed Music &amp; Drama block.</p>
<p>The opening, at which teachers, governors and students attended, Mrs John said: “This new block is a fantastic base for our young musicians and performers- they deserve the best. I’m really pleased to see that during lunchtime, during lessons, it’s a thriving place for our students. Thank you so much to Grant for being able to join us for the official opening.”</p></div>

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-35/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with another update about the Coronavirus pandemic and some other local issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, as you will probably be aware, the Prime Minister has taken a decision to extend the remaining restrictions until the end of the 18th July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summary of the current rules is &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEDDINGS AND CIVIL PARTNERSHIP CEREMONIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two exceptions to this. The first is that the limit of 30 people allowed to attend a wedding has been removed, though a number of conditions remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details of this are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-wedding-and-civil-partnership-ceremonies-receptions-and-celebrations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARE HOME RESIDENTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition care home residents are now allowed to spend a night away from their homes without having to isolate on their return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details are here:&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/care-home-residents-can-stay-overnight-as-visiting-restrictions-ease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SURREY COVID CASES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent increase in cases in Surrey has mostly affected younger people who are yet to be vaccinated and those who have only had a single jab. This does underline how important it is that people who are still unvaccinated or who have yet to book in for their second jab and are eligible to do so book an appointment now. You can do so via the NHS website at;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest figures for Surrey are &lt;a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/263691/Surrey_covid-19_infographic_1106.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHALK PIT EPSOM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know many people remain extremely concerned about the noise and dust nuisance coming from the Chalk Pit in College Road, Epsom at the moment. I have been working with local residents on the issue and pushing the Environment Agency to act. I have had several meetings with the Agency and they have been working through a formal process which I hope will reach a resolution in the next few days. Please keep updating me if you experience serious noise or dust from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CITIZENS ADVICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epsom and Ewell Citizens Advice team have asked me to remind people that if they are having difficulties as a result of the pandemic or some other issue, they are often able to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their latest details and contacts &lt;a href="http://www.caee.org.uk/get-advice/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much hope that we can move on from the pandemic very soon and everyone will be able to enjoy the rest of the summer. As always, if you have questions or issues please feel free to email me, though please use my Parliamentary address as this message comes from a no reply service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Grayling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RT Hon Chris Grayling MP&lt;br /&gt;
Member of Parliament for Epsom and Ewell&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith welcomes agreement on Bulls Elite Academy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/mp-welcomes-agreement-on-bulls-elite-academy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to news that Bradford Bulls will now continue to run an Elite Academy, Bradford South Labour MP Judith Cummins said, “I’m pleased that the club and the RFL have reached a resolution that enables Bradford to continue to run an Elite Academy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would, however, have been better for all concerned to have avoided the worry and trauma in the first place,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ms Cummins had challenged the RFL on the process and decision that saw Bradford losing out in the award of Elite Academy licences. She questioned whether quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and deep roots into the community game had been given little weight in the consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Bulls Academy has been productive and respected for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There remain challenges ahead but I’m looking forward to working with and supporting the club and the RFL to make sure that the sport has a healthy future,” said Ms Cummins.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
