      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h1>War in Ukraine</h1>
<p>As a country and a region we have faced many challenges since I entered Parliament in 2010 – cruel austerity cuts, a global pandemic, a cost of living crisis. But in the last month we have seen the threat of war in Europe become a terrible reality in Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion that will have tragic consequences for Ukraine and its people. It is a terrob;e violation of international law that breaks multiple treaties and commitments, including the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. The Labour Party stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people as they bravely resist this assault on their – and our – freedom. It was a privilege to be in Parliament for the Ukrainian President Zelensky’s historic address, and I have made clear in my contributions in Parliament that the people of Newcastle Central are horrified by the suffering they see daily and wish to help those fleeing what often appear to be war crimes.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ChiOnwurah/status/1501530726696734726?cxt=HHwWjMC-gbKPwdYpAAAA">https://twitter.com/ChiOnwurah/status/1501530726696734726?cxt=HHwWjMC-gbKPwdYpAAAA</a></strong></p>
<p>But I have been shamed by the limited response of the British Home Office. Families fleeing bombs in Ukraine need urgent help right now to reach safety and get support.  People need a simple and safe route to sanctuary right now but the Home Office’s deliberate ‘hostile environment’ approach to refugees and asylum seekers is preventing the UK rising to the challenge. I repeatedly clashed with the Home Secretary and other Ministers over the lack of support for refugees.</p>
<p>Labour has called for emergency protection visas for those fleeing Ukraine who want to reach the UK. This would provide a quick, simple and safe route to sanctuary for all who need it.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian people are showing great courage and strength in the face of an appalling Russian onslaught and we need to support them – including through giving sanctuary to those fleeing war in Europe as we have done in generations past</p>
<p>The conflict has also emphasised our dependence on oil and gas, often from unattractive regimes. Labour believes that we must protect ordinary people from the huge rises in energy prices  through a windfall tax on oil companies profits!  Labour also announced our five point plan for energy security to cut imports and energy bills.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting United with Pride</strong></p>
<h1>Backbench and Constituency Role</h1>
<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ukraine provided a significant amount of casework, mainly from constituents with relatives in the Ukraine desperate to get out. I also received many expressions of support for Ukraine, and concerns at the lack of welcome from the Home Office for refugees.</li>
<li>I met with United with Pride at their St James Park AGM to discuss the challenges LGBT+ fans still face in supporting Newcastle United.</li>
<li>I received the written response of the Minister to the Westminster Hall debate which launched my All the Hadrian’s Wall campaign. The Minister praised the campaign but also confirmed there is no money specifically for restoring urban heritage. I met with Historic England and we are working together to raise awareness, and hopefully funding.</li>
<li>I opened the Labour North conference at the Helix in Newcastle, introducing our Shadow Deputy Prime Minister Angela Raynor and emphasising the importance of science and technology investment to secure good jobs now and in the future.</li>
<li>I marked International Woman’s Day with events in Newcastle and in Parliament. I also highlighted the first anniversary of the murder of Sarah Everad, and the continuing failure of Government and others to properly address violence against women.</li>
<li>I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding families of constituents in Afghanistan, the availability of tests for businesses, the Eldon Square memorial, community car clubs and the Cooperage building on the Quayside.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>West End Refugee Service visit</strong></p>
<h1>Shadow Ministerial and PES Role</h1>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of the Government much anticipated Levelling Up report by my office and the Campaign for Science and Engineering has shown up its myriad failings – the much celebrated increase in the amount of science spend outside the ‘Golden Triangle’ of London, Cambridge and Oxford, just amounts to a continuation of current funding levels, given the overall increase in science spend.</li>
<li>There is increasing concern in the science community over the delay in joining the Horizon European Funding scheme which Ministers continue to blame on European bureaucracy rather than their own bungled engagement.</li>
<li>I wrote to George Freeman to express serious concern that the Conservative manifesto pledge to double Dementia research spending had been being dropped</li>
<li>I continue to meet with science, research and innovation stakeholders and have organised a number of round tables.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Organisation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Assia is leaving us to take up a full time position elsewhere and so I am advertising for a trainee Admin Assistant.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Media</h1>
<p>Quoted regularly in national and local media including BBC Radio 4: The Life Scientific, ITV – Culture funding, BBC TV North interview regarding Government Shipbuilding Strategy announcement</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-74/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My week began with the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-07/debates/97B249F2-C666-46EF-B46A-F2FF22DE2264/EconomicCrime(TransparencyAndEnforcement)Bill">Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill</a> and after a very long debate on the many amendments that had been tabled, only three amendments were pushed to a division. New Clause 2 was a cross-party amendment and was voted on at 9.39pm. It would require the Secretary of State to publish and lay before Parliament a report on the funding of enforcement agencies in connection with the reforms to “unexplained wealth orders”, as provided for in part 2 of the Bill. We lost 229-303. New Clause 7 was a Labour Front Bench amendment and was voted on at 9.54pm. It would require the Secretary of State to lay draft legislation on further Companies House reform (taken from the White Paper published on Monday) within 28 days of this proposal receiving Royal Assent. We lost 225-306. New Clause 29 was another cross-party amendment and was voted on at 10.08pm. It would empower the Secretary of State to publish the name of a person being considered as a “person for sanctions”, which immediately imposes on that person a duty not to sell any assets they own or in which they have an interest, or to move any of their assets or funds out of the UK, on pain of criminal liability (and risk of imprisonment). We lost 234-300.</p>
<p>Tuesday began with a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Restorative Justice (RJ) of which I’ve been vice-chair since its inception in April 2021. We discussed progress on the work streams that were set up directly from the recommendations contained in our inquiry report “<a href="https://restorativejustice.org.uk/blog/restorative-justice-appg-inquiry-report-published">Restorative Practices in 2021/22</a>” which sought to assess where the sector is and what steps could be taken to improve and co-ordinate the various services and improve outcomes for victims and offenders. The inquiry brought together over 50 leading practitioners and exponents of RJ, and there were over 200,000 submitted words of evidence. The APPG are hopeful that the UK Government will recognise the enormous benefits of RJ and roll out our recommendations in full across the UK. The 9 recommendations are: registration of commissioned services; standardise information sharing; improve quality through monitoring and evaluation; publication of a new action plan; reviewing ring-fenced RJ funding; explore automatic rights for victims through Victims Law; PCCs should end RJ funding blanket bans; more and better communications; and creating a specific RJ UK Government Minister. At our APPG meeting the chair Elliot Colburn MP stated that the report had been well received, but he was very disappointed that Victim’s Law did not mention RJ once.</p>
<p>As a member of the Petitions Committee, I attended a future work program meeting and I’m honoured to have been nominated to present the “<a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/554073">Ban greyhound racing to end the unnecessary deaths and suffering of racing dogs</a>” petition on behalf of the Petitions Committee in Westminster Hall on Monday 28th March. The petition has attracted 104,885 signatures.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-08/debates/d57f8a4a-304a-4bc1-9f56-c17cdc4ab6e6/DraftHumanMedicines(CoronavirusAndInfluenza)(Amendment)Regulations2022DraftHumanMedicines(AmendmentsRelatingToTheEarlyAccessToMedicinesScheme)Regulati"> Third Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which discussed 2 Statutory Instruments which were to be taken together because they have a similar purpose. The first SI concerns regulations made in 2020 which made temporary provisions for the manufacture and use of coronavirus and influenza vaccinations, to ensure that vaccines could be distributed and administered at pace. These regulations included a sunset clause which meant that the provisions ceased on 1st April 2022. This SI extends the sunset clause for some provisions to 1st April 2024, and makes others permanent. The second SI provided a statutory basis for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) which gives patients with life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to treatments that are either not authorised or not authorised for that particular clinical use. The members of the committee agreed that the 2 SIs be debated together. The UK Government Minister Ed Argar, moved and explained the SIs. The Labour Shadow Minister Andrew Gwynne and the SNP Spokesperson asked questions of the Minister, but did not oppose the SIs, which were approved without a division.</p>
<p>The Speaker granted the unprecedented request from the President of another country to make a direct, live, <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28902686-865d-48ea-ba23-90aa2aebd061?agenda=True">address to Parliamentarians</a> in the Chamber of the House of Commons. At 4.45pm the Speaker suspended the sitting so that MPs could take their seats, and Peers sat in the Private Gallery, to listen to the address from the President of Ukraine, who spoke to us in Ukrainian, but we all had headsets which carried contemporary translation. The President has shown immense courage and leadership in the face of the untrammelled aggression from Putin. Words are not enough to express the suffering of Ukraine people at the hands of a despot. We gave the President a standing ovation at the beginning and at the end of his speech. It was one of the most emotional moments of my life as an MP.</p>
<p>As chair of the APPG for Sport I met virtually with our secretariat Max and Leigh from the Sport and Recreation Alliance to plan our forthcoming APPG meetings for 2022. There are so many issues in the sport sector that need discussing. Some examples are: feedback on the Olympics and Paralympics; Sport in Devolved Nations – massive congratulations to my friend Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson who was appointed chair of Sport Wales this week – Tanni is vice-chair of our APPG; and the UK Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-russias-war-on-ukraine-international-sport">statement</a> released by Rt Hon Secretary of State DCMS Nadine Dorries MP about Russia’s War on Ukraine and International Sport.</p>
<p>I bobbed throughout the duration of PMQs, but unfortunately the Speaker did not call me. This is the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1501588121993031680?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">question would have asked</a> on behalf of my constituents: “On 1st March, two of my constituents went to Ukraine to rescue three family members. They applied for a Ukraine Family Scheme Visa and were given appointments at VAC Rzeszow, but Tatiana aged 65 was given 18th March, Olya aged 38 was given 21st March, and young Danil aged 9 was given 22nd March. They are now homeless. I’ve urged UK Visa and Immigration to act quickly and give the family appointments on the same day, but no answer. What would you tell my constituents Prime Minister?”.</p>
<p>As a Labour and Co-operative MP I reported back regarding the Wales Co-operative Council AGM to our monthly meeting of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. It is important that the work of the Group and the Council are mutually recognised for all the work that they do together to promote the values of the Co-operative Party.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to email christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152 – we are here to help.</p>

    <title>What does national resilience look like?</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The government now says  it does wish the UK to be more self reliant. One obvious area to start with is energy, the centre of the current cost of living and international crisis.</p>
<p>The government wishes to move to a  net zero future. They need to understand that for the next few years most people will need gas for their home heating boilers, most energy using industry will still need gas for ceramics and steel, bricks and cement.  Most cars, trucks and vans will still need petrol or diesel. The electric revolution will be more widespread next decade, not this.</p>
<p>That is why the UK government now  needs to call in the oil and gas industry in the UK and encourage it to fill the gap of the next few years with more UK produced gas and oil. The Business Secretary implied he would do so. So when will he make the announcements that policy needs? We do not need more studies or White Papers. The need is urgent. He and his officials need to give licences to explore and to produce more  from all the known deposits and fields. The Treasury needs to consider if the tax regime is sending the right signals, as it will be a big winner from more domestic production. Producing UK oil and gas already incurs Corporation tax at double the standard rate.</p>
<p>For its wider goal of decarbonising the government needs to make more rapid progress with small nuclear reactors, to conclude if this is feasible and economic and if so pump prime a development and production programme to make them a  next decade reality. It needs to see which combination of technologies could back its extension of windfarms so that they can keep the lights on when the wind does not blow or blows too much.  They need to decide on   the balance of green hydrogen production, battery storage and pump storage as the main means of storing wind energy when it is available and using it when the wind is on strike. Affordability matters when they make their choices. You cannot rely on more wind farms alone as there are too many hours when there is no wind or when you have to switch off the turbines because the wind is too strong. All the energy they produce on windy nights needs to be stored for use on calm days.</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up</title>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started the week with International Women’s Day and the theme has continued throughout the week! I was pleased to contribute to the debate on Government support for breastfeeding. We know that the first few months of a child’s life are crucial for their later development and that parents need support in their choices for their children. I welcome the Minister’s commitment to additional funding for breastfeeding support, but it is clear that the cuts, particularly to Sure Start, were a really bad false economy, with centres having closed, parents lacking support and advice, and children being let down. Disadvantaged mothers are more likely to have babies of low birth weight, and low birth weight is associated with raised blood pressure and coronary heart disease, as well as reduced educational attainment, qualifications and employment. Sure Start centres help to level up and supporting them would be a really easy, quick win for the Government to support women in optimal infant nutrition, particularly breastfeeding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to speak at a Labour Women Bristol event for IWD on my experience as a woman in politics. We hear a lot about the abuse that women face online, and many female politicians experience the most appalling attacks. It is so important that we tackle the abuse that women face and build better support networks because women in politics ensures the representation that we need. The better our representation, the more diverse our representation and the better we can represent all our constituents and ensure that the UK is a country that promotes equality and tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Zelensky of Ukraine addressed the House of Commons this week in a historic moment. It was incredibly moving to watch and listen to him talk about the resolve of Ukrainians to fight for their freedom. We must stand with them in any way we can – we must do more to help care for the people fleeing this terrible violence. I know constituents who have been affected and who are seeking to be reunited with their loved ones in safety. The UK Government must act immediately to ensure that there is a swift and reliable route for refugees to be able to come to the UK. It truly is the least we can do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to join a meeting on the right to maintain contact organised by Rights for Residents, the Relatives and Residents Association, and John’s Campaign. It is so important for the mental wellbeing of patients in care that they are able to easily maintain contact with their loved ones. We have seen during the Covid pandemic the heart-breaking impact that being separated from loved ones has, and that is heightened when someone cannot fully understand why. These organisations are calling for recognition in law of the role that family plays in the lives of vulnerable people in care. Health and Social Care goes beyond simply what happens in care settings – it’s how we incorporate care into everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fantastic to visit Bridge Farm Primary School on Friday to meet the pupil parliament and to discuss parental engagement, the environment, rights respecting schools, and pupil voice. I often find talking with children reminds you of the important facts and the issues that impact our children. It was a pleasure to meet the pupil parliament and to hear about what is important to them.</span></p>

<p>This year only one of 16 suppliers, reviewed for the Which Energy Survey, received a Recommended Provider award.</p>



<p>That means only one achieved the standards and consideration for consumers that might be expected.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not that surprised, given recent experiences I&#8217;ve had while attempting to contact the company that came bottom of the league.</p>



<p>Recommended providers are those whose approach helps customers and prioritises things like good customer service and accessibility.</p>



<p>Many of these businesses now opt for online communication as their main means of contact for consumers. That&#8217;s fine for those with access to computers and comfortable with digital communication and when there are no complicated problems but what about those who struggle, especially older people and those without smart phones?</p>



<p>Several suppliers are keen to point out they offer a free 0808 number but it&#8217;s not unusual to wait 25 minutes for a call to be answered and I&#8217;ve come across far too many examples of people being passed from pillar to post.</p>



<p>I recognise the price of energy is rising dramatically due to increases in the cost of gas and oil and that the problem is getting worse because of Putin&#8217;s brutal invasion of Ukraine. However, I&#8217;m not sure that explains why companies need to put up their standing charges.</p>



<p>How exactly do they relate to rising costs on the world market? Could it be that they&#8217;re taking advantage and hope we won&#8217;t notice?</p>



<p>Some issues may be beyond the government&#8217;s control but people don&#8217;t understand why the Chancellor is adding to their eventual bills by loaning money to energy companies which he then expects customers to repay while oil and gas giants enjoy record profits and avoid any windfall tax.</p>



<p>The government needs to look at what more can be done. Ofgem, the regulatory body for Gas and Electricity Markets, are also quite hard to contact by phone and I couldn&#8217;t find any details on their website about what they&#8217;re doing to improve overall services for customer, particularly accessibility and customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something very wrong when only one in 16 suppliers can achieve Recommended Provider status.</p>

    <title>Isles MP exasperated by Home Office’s heartless attitude to refugees</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/03/11/isles-mp-exasperated-by-home-offices-heartless-attitude-to-refugees/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has expressed his exasperation at the attitude of the UK Home Office as regards to refugees coming from war-torn Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil has been contacted by a high number of constituents across the islands throughout this week who are disgusted by the UK Home Office’s heartless attitude to refugees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “I am dismayed at the fanatical attitude towards refugees displayed by the Home Office. It seems to hold very extremist views. The UK is alone in Europe and no other country is doing what the UK is doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Personally, I have been working with a family in Lewis trying to get relations back and despite the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, telling me that there was a task-force coming in a week last Tuesday and that she was dealing with the matter personally, nothing has changed materially for these people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In fact, in the Chamber I had cross words with the Home Secretary because of the weakness of her response to what is an extremely serious situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It angers me daily that there is still no progress for people and indeed, some are becoming so dismayed and disheartened with the UK’s approach that they have decided not to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At one stage we had the situation that if people had begun the Visa process with their appointment in Warsaw, if they wanted to change their appointment to Dublin, they would have to restart the entire Visa process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This may have ameliorated somewhat in the last few days, but it is still far below what every other decent European country is doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The situation is doubly worse in the UK in that the principal opposition party – the Labour Party &amp;#8211; are also in the extreme fanatical wing and want to get people who are fleeing for their lives to get down to the pen-pushing bureaucracy of acquiring a visa.&amp;nbsp; Both need a check with reality and a check with decency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People who have to get out of a war-torn country should be welcomed with open arms. They should not be kept out in the cold, as was literally seen in -5C in some British institutions in Poland on their way to an appointment at UK application centres which were ill-prepared to deal with the amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If Ireland, with a population of 5m, can let in far more people than the UK which has a far greater population, then the Tory UK Government and the principal opposition Labour Party, need to have a good, hard look at what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At least some compassion here in the islands, outside the Westminster political bubble of Tory and Labour, is that people are asking when refugees are coming and are looking to help. The Westminster situation is far different to the attitude of normal people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reason they are coming to Ireland is because Ireland is independent. Scotland isn’t independent and that is why we are dealing with the extremists and the fanatics at the disorganised UK Government Home Office.”&lt;/p&gt;

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP will stand unopposed as the Labour candidate for the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency at the next General Election, it has been confirmed today (Thursday 10th March 2022). <br/>
 <br/>
Edgbaston Labour confirmed today that the sitting MP had been successful in the selection process, receiving the support of all branches and affiliates and therefore unanimously re-selected by the party. <br/>
 <br/>
As part of the selection process, all Labour branches chose to reselect Ms Gill as well as 33 trade union branches and affiliates including the Co-Operative Party, Irish Society, Unite, GMB, Unison, Usdaw, Aslef, Jewish Labour Movement, Birmingham Fabians and the Socialist Health Association.<br/>
 <br/>
Welcoming the announcement from the party, Preet Kaur Gill MP said: “I am delighted that party members and the wider Labour movement have put their trust in me once again to be their representative for our constituency.<br/>
 <br/>
“Being the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, where I grew up, has been the greatest honour of my life. Since being elected I have voted more than 745 times, asked 1,700 parliamentary questions and spoken in over 200 debates. Time and again, I’ve worked hard to represent local residents on the issues that matter most to them.<br/>
 <br/>
"During the pandemic, casework soared with so many people writing to me and calling to ask for help. Over the last four years, I’ve supported more than 31,000 people with a range of issues. I am particularly proud to have been named the Patchwork Foundation’s MP of the year in 2020 which recognised the work I have done in creating a mentoring programme for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and advancing the concerns of minority groups.<br/>
 <br/>
“But it is the successes I’ve had with local campaigns that brings me the greatest pride. Alongside Labour supporters and local residents, we protested to keep our banks open on Harborne High Street. I have worked with the police on Saif Lodge, to ensure that the first example in the country of substandard exempt accommodation was permanently closed. I’ve also worked hard in Birmingham to ensure we improve the state of our roads. Now that the council has put an end to the disastrous Tory PFI contract with Amey, I have worked with our excellent Labour councillors to see that Edgbaston constituency gets a considerable proportion of the £100 million investment to repair and resurface our roads.<br/>
 <br/>
“But there is so much more for me to do for communities across our constituency. I will continue to work tirelessly to represent the interests of everyone and look forward to contesting the next General Election as Labour’s candidate”.</p>

  <summary type="text">South Lakes MP Tim Farron has secured a massive victory in his campaign to stop plans to merge Lancaster and Preston's hospitals onto a single site.
These plans were first announced by the Conservative Government back in 2020, prompting fears it could lead to even longer journeys to access emergency care for patients in the South Lakes.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>South Lakes MP Tim Farron has secured a massive victory in his campaign to stop plans to merge Lancaster and Preston's hospitals onto a single site.</p>
<p>These plans were first announced by the Conservative Government back in 2020, prompting fears it could lead to even longer journeys to access emergency care for patients in the South Lakes.</p>
<p>Tim raised the issue with health ministers in meetings and on the floor of the House and earlier this year presented an 8,000-strong petition to the Department for Health, calling for the plans to be scrapped.</p>
<p>But this afternoon, a press release from the Lancashire and South Cumbria Health and Care partnership revealed that the plans have now been "discounted".</p>
<p>Commenting on the news this evening, Tim said: <em>"I'm absolutely over the moon that after months and months of pressure, these dangerous plans are now finally in the bin where they belong.</em></p>
<p><em>"I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who signed the petition and backed the campaign - this is your victory.</em></p>
<p><em>"However, I will be watching the rest of this process like a hawk to make sure that no hospital services are moved from Kendal or Lancaster to Preston."</em></p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p>It will not surprise readers that the most pressing issue at Westminster just now is the horrific and unwarranted invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin is a ruthless dictator who is now a war criminal – there can be no doubt of the lengths he will go to get what he wants.</p>
<p>It was a poignant moment in the Chamber of the House of Commons last week when the whole house, political representatives of all parties, rose to give the Ukrainian ambassador, Nadya Prystaiko, a lengthy standing ovation. It was emotional to be able to show solidaritity with his nation in some small way.</p>
<p>As a gesture, it grabbed the media’s attention and sent a signal to the watching world. It was, however, but a gesture. No matter how heartfelt and profound, it cannot replace the urgent action required by the UK Government to support Ukrainian families.</p>
<p>Ukraine alone cannot halt the Putin led Russian forces from killing more innocent people – they need meaningful support, and they need it now.</p>
<p>I cannot remember ever receiving more emails from constituents on a single subject – thousands of you have been in touch to urge me to lobby the UK Government to do more and ask me what you can do to help. Many of you have been frustrated to watch the lack of haste and meaningful action on sanctions and sanctuary from Boris Johnson and his Government.</p>
<p>While there has been some good work on sanctions, there is an awful lot of wriggle room left for Russian Oligarchs with links to Putin and seemingly little ideas about what to do with any frozen or seized funds.</p>
<p>Loopholes, lasting weeks or months, are being left to allow bad actors to move their dirty money out of the UK, making a mockery of the sanctions process. Why are the Tories allowing this? You’ll have to make your own mind up on that.</p>
<p>On sanctuary, we have seen the whole of Europe throw open their doors to fleeing refugees, suspending visa requirements for three years, in an inspirational show of common decency and solidarity. Disgracefully, the UK government have thus far refused to mirror this action. Instead, we have to listen to Ministers suggest Ukrainians can apply for ‘fruit picking’ visas and their backbench MPs wailing that their constituencies are ‘too full’ – telling us they have already ‘done their bit’.</p>
<p>On behalf of the people of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey, I urged the Foreign Secretary to allow us to follow the actions of our European neighbours – she dismissed my appeal.</p>
<p>In contrast, the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has pledged that Scotland is ready to welcome Ukrainian refugees and urges the UK government to waive visa requirements for people seeking refuge.</p>
<p>Here at home, our communities have shown their support for Ukraine in every way possible. From businesses and groups collecting donations to the various vigils and protests, people across the constituency are doing what they can to show solidarity with Ukraine’s people. They are joined by our wonderful public organisations ready to support refugees seeking safety.</p>
<p>I know many readers are already doing much to help and are keen to do more. An initiative worthy of praise is DEC’s humanitarian appeal. For those who are able to and wish to contribute £10, text SUPPORT to 70150.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, joined NHS staff and health leaders to help launch the NHS Parliamentary Awards 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS Parliamentary Awards was launched in 2018 to celebrate the NHS&amp;#8217; 70th Birthday and recognise the outstanding contribution of staff, volunteers and others working within the health and care sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in its fifth year, the Parliamentary awards have been a massive success, with over 450 Members of Parliament nominating an individual or organisation for an award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwynne, who is also Labour&amp;#8217;s Shadow Minister for Public Health, is now encouraging local residents across Denton and Reddish to get in touch with any teams, individuals or organisations they think deserve recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The NHS Parliamentary Awards are a fantastic initiative, and I&amp;#8217;m really proud to be supporting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, our NHS has faced incredible pressure, and staff, volunteers and carers have gone above and beyond to get us through the pandemic. These heroes deserve to be recognised and celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you know a local person, team or organisation that you think deserves national recognition, please get in touch!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To submit a nomination, residents are encouraged to email gwynnea@parliament.uk with details. Nominations will close on the 4th of April.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Yesterday, Parliament was honoured to have Ukraine&#8217;s President Volodymyr Zelensky address the House of Commons.</p>
<p>President Zelensky is the first foreign leader to ever address the House of Commons chamber. He made an incredibly moving speech to MPs and Lords in the chamber on the current situation in Ukraine, and the support Ukraine needs to defend itself from Russia&#8217;s terrible invasion. He received two standing ovations.</p>
<p>You can see President Zelensky&#8217;s statement <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28902686-865d-48ea-ba23-90aa2aebd061">here</a> or read it <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-08/debates/22030870000001/Addendum">here.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>In response to President Zelensky&#8217;s statement, the Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said “Labour stands for the unity at home and abroad that will isolate the Putin regime. Labour stands for the toughest sanctions that will cripple the Russian state. Labour stands for providing Ukraine with the arms it needs to fight off its invaders. Labour stands with President Zelensky, with Ukraine, with democracy. Slava Ukraini.”</p>
<p>You can read Keir Starmer&#8217;s response in full <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-08/debates/8106FAD2-2E07-4943-85F4-C91F6BB458AD/NationalInsuranceContributionsIncrease#contribution-EFA54F6B-DD7F-44C9-B07D-0F74ADB947F7">here.</a></p>

    <title>Violence Against Women and Girls</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.danjarvis.org/violence_against_women_and_girls" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Readers of last week’s edition of the <em>Barnsley Chronicle </em>will have seen the story of Darfield Councillor Pauline Markham, the victim of a despicable and cowardly attack in a local park, simply for serving the public to the best of her ability. In her own words she summed up the injustice, “I was simply a woman who was walking her dog.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly, Pauline’s story is part of a much wider issue – our collective failure to take violence against women and girls seriously. We’ve seen it locally in the rising instances of girls’ drinks being spiked on nights out, soaring cases of stalking in the last year; and the devastating statistic that 86% of women aged 18-24 in the UK have been sexually harassed.</p></div>

    <title>Local Update Ukraine</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-ukraine/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am writing to you with information about local help for those affected by the situation in Ukraine as well as how you can contribute to the national fund being collected to support people affected by the War.</p>
<p>A local team has set up a collection centre for local donations in the old H&amp;M unit in the Ashley Centre. That’s the original unit near House of Fraser and not the double floored one which has closed recently. They are in the process of setting up a formal charity to do so, and have an organised plan to move donations out to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their biggest ask right now is for donations of medical supplies, and in particular things like bandages, as well as over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen. If you have items that you do not need, or are willing to buy some and drop them off there, I know that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>They are also asking for donations to help pay for fuel costs to get van loads of supplies to the Polish/Ukrainian border, and are able to take cash or card donations at the centre in Epsom.</p>
<p>If you want to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee/Red Cross national appeal the link to the appeal site is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dec.org.uk">www.dec.org.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>Your donation is being match funded by the Government.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me about providing accommodation locally for Ukrainian refugees. I am in discussions about this at the moment and will provide a further update later in the week.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local MP wins refunds for residents of burned-out flats</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has won refunds for residents of Ashley Court, Hatfield, who were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire, and then subject to unfair service charges for housing they were unable to reside in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has been over a year since the residents of Ashley Court were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During this time residents, many of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site &amp;#8211; residing in temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building work aimed at restoring Ashley Court has also been delayed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, residents of Ashley Court were billed £225 per month in service charges for housing they had not occupied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This monthly fee included charges for various services, including a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, which residents were not benefitting from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 2021, local MP Grant Shapps wrote to Sanctuary Housing, the housing association responsible for managing Ashley Court, expressing his concern about “the impact on his constituents” nominally resident there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary Housing responded to Mr Shapps’ letter but at that time did not agree to waive the £225 a month charge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In February, Mr Shapps wrote to the association once again (below), this time saying that he was putting it “on notice” over its unfair treatment of residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40879" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40880" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following this most recent letter, Sanctuary Housing responded quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a major victory for the residents, the association apologised, saying that it had got its “approach wrong” regarding Ashley Court, and that it would be refunding service charge payments to residents as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The association also said it would refund payments for deceased residents to their respective estates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary Housing stated it would be conducting a “more detailed review” of how the residents of Ashley Court were put in their previous unfair situation and would share its findings with Mr Shapps’ office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The association agreed to meet with Mr Shapps in March saying that its representative would apologise in person, and that it would put itself on the “appropriate footing” to work with him going forward. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councillor Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of the residents of Ashley court, will also attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Hebden said of the recent good news: “This is a fantastic step forward for the residents. There are other issues to be resolved but if Sanctuary Housing are adopting a new resident-focussed stance then I’m a lot more optimistic”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps gave his own thoughts on the matter adding: “This is a great result for the residents of Ashley Court, and I’m incredibly happy to have been part of the effort to facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As Councillor Hebden has said, this is a step forward for the residents, and I’m sure that our meeting with Sanctuary Housing will yield further results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Putting residents in such an unfair situation was unacceptable, so I’m hoping that this outcome will go some way to putting their minds at ease.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Over the last few days, I have received many emails from constituents, and indeed from across the country, expressing concerns and even outrage at the invasion of Ukraine, an independent sovereign state, by President Putin’s military machine. I distinguish the act of this dictator and tyrant, Putin, from the Russian people, who like most people everywhere, want to live their lives in freedom and peace. I want to express my solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also I want to commend those brave Russians who are standing up to Putin’s warmongering. His erratic and irrational behaviour is a serious threat to us all.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Putin’s attack on Ukraine is an unprovoked and unjustifiable outrage that will have tragic consequences for Ukraine, Europe and our world. It is a heinous violation of international law that breaks multiple treaties and commitments, including the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. Putin’s actions should be utterly condemned by all nations. As such, I regret that some countries in the UN Security Council failed to support a UN resolution calling for this yesterday.</em></p>
<p><em>This assault on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must now have serious consequences for Putin and his supporters. I am clear that there can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we depend and have broadly enjoyed since the end of the Second World War.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>We must now match our rhetoric with action. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin and against the Russian Government’s interests, working in a coordinated and unified way with our allies to ensure the Putin regime faces the severest possible consequences for their actions.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The UK sanctions earlier this week have been recognised as far too limited. Yesterday’s additional sanctions are wider reaching but there will undoubtedly need to be more. Some of you have proposed your own sanctions including ‘isolating </em><em>Russia completely’ and ‘stop buying oil, gas and other commodities from Russia’. I agree. Under Putin’s presidency, Russia must be seen as a pariah state and ostracised from the world economy.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>We need to move quickly to stop the influence of corrupt Russian money in the UK. Despite warning after warning, the Government failed to act, leaving Britain as the destination of choice for kleptocrats who hide their wealth under our noses. It has been going on for far too long and should not have taken an invasion of Ukraine for the Government to act. The Economic Crime Bill must now be brought forward, as well as introducing an Overseas Entities Bill.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>But we must prepare for the consequences of these sanctions against Russia in energy and financial markets, working with our allies and partners to manage disruptions and shocks.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>International co-ordination with our allies is imperative. This applies not just to sanctions, but to humanitarian aid and military defensive actions. We must work in conjunction with our NATO allies to mount our response against Putin.</em></p>
<p><em>In the short term, we must:</em></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><em>ensure the Foreign Office is providing effective consular support and assistance, with sufficient staffing and resources, to help UK nationals and their families seeking to leave.  I have been pressing Ministers in the Foreign Office and Home Office for nearly a month now to make access to visas and travel documents for UK nationals and their families easier.  I am pleased there is an effort to streamline the process, but believe Ministers could, and should, have acted</em><em> far</em><em> more quickly.</em></li>
<li><em>provide urgent humanitarian assistance and to work with our partners and Ukraine’s neighbours to manage </em><em>the </em><em>large-scale displacement </em><em>that we are already seeing as </em><em>refugee</em><em>s</em><em> fl</em><em>ee their homeland</em><em>.</em></li>
<li><em>continue to play our part as a member of NATO to support and reinforce other NATO members on the Eastern flank.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>As difficult as it is to predict irrational behaviour, we must try and anticipate Putin’s next steps. In relation to this, given the overwhelming evidence that Russian state actors have tried to disrupt and destabilise western democracies by disseminating disinformation through social media platforms such as Facebook, including at election times, I asked the Prime Minister what steps his Government was taking to prevent this happening now. Unfortunately this doesn’t seem to be on the Government’s horizon yet. It should be.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t believe the Russian people want this war; this is an ageing and unstable leader with a warped view of what his legacy should be. The international community’s response must learn the lessons from history.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I’m grateful to everyone who has contacted me so far and for the humanity and kindness they have shown for the distress of the Ukrainian people. I’d particularly like to thank those of you who have offered to open up their homes to Ukrainian refugees. This is the Oldham and Saddleworth I’m so proud to serve.</em></p>

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <title>Government must act now to end crisis in dentistry</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/government-must-act-now-to-end-crisis-in-dentistry/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bradford South MP Judith Cummins has warned the government that if it does not act now, NHS dentistry in England faces collapse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a debate on Access to NHS Dentistry which Judith co-sponsored, Judith told the government they were trying to solve long-term issues with short-term fixes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The current dental contract and under-investment makes work for dentists highly stressful and doesn’t allow them to provide the quality of care to their patients they feel they deserve. There are long-standing problems with burnout, recruiting and retention, with almost a thousand dentists leaving the NHS in England in the last financial year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the British Dental Association, over 40 million NHS dental appointments have been lost since the start of the pandemic, which amounts to a whole year’s worth of NHS dentistry in pre-COVID times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith continued: “While the government has provided limited amounts of money for dentists to catch up on missed appointments, dental practices in my constituency tell me the funding is virtually unusable. It must be used by March and there is simply physically not enough time to fit these appointments in.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this was an issue brewing long before the pandemic, as even before COVID, there was only enough dentistry for around half of the adult population in England to see an NHS dentist every two years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the debate, Judith said: “There is not a week that goes by where I don’t have someone contacting me about the lack of dentists. We’ve lost a whole year of appointments while the government is giving with one hand and taking away with the other because the government just knows the money just cannot be spent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yorkshire and the Humber has the worst child oral health in the country, with twice the level of tooth decay than in the East of England. In Bradford, almost a thousand children under the age of 10 had to be admitted to hospital to have decayed teeth removed under a general anaesthetic last year. That is thousands of children who are in pain while they await surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need a new deal that treats dentistry as an equal member of the NHS family and not as a Cinderella service. We must work to achieve a fully funded service where NHS dentistry is available to all. The government needs to act and it needs to act now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>City Council Leader Responds to “Levelling Up” Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/02/02/city-council-leader-responds-to-levelling-up-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>). The latest business grants for businesses affected by the recent restrictions are now available through the local Council, which you can find <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/">here</a>. For constituents self-isolating who are struggling financially, there is also the £500 self-isolation NHS Test &amp; Trace Support payment, which you can find further details on the eligibility criteria for <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/benefits/test-and-trace-support-payment/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/benefits/test-and-trace-support-payment/">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients.

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

    <title>Steve Reed calls on Council to work with residents to save South Norwood Library</title>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
