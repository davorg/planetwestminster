    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-48/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This week, we marked one year since the announcement of the first UK lockdown due to Covid. A minute’s silence was held in the House of Commons to mark the day and to remember all those who we have lost and those who have been left bereaved since the pandemic began. It was a chance to reflect on the struggles and challenges of the last year, but also to champion the heroes and scientific advances that have brought us through the worst parts of the pandemic. As a community, the people of Neath have come together to support and boost the morale of our NHS heroes in a way not seen before, and as the vaccination programme gives us hope for the future, we must ensure that this new sense of community spirit prevails beyond the pandemic. I lit my candle at 8pm to remember those who had died and to think of the families and friends across the country who are now mourning the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>This week I’ve attended six All Party Parliamentary Groups.</p>
<p>The APPG on Access to Medical Cannabis under Prescription, chaired by Tonia Antoniazzi MP for Gower, discussed the current and urgent issues of access and funding to medical cannabis. The total, continuous block on attempts to gain funded NHS prescriptions continues to result in great hardship for families with children who are suffering from intractable epilepsy. The benefit of medical cannabis for children suffering from epilepsy is dramatic, some children have gone from being almost comatose, pumped full of powerful pharmaceutical drugs, still wracked by seizures to being almost seizure-free and living almost normal lives. But these families can no longer afford to pay thousands of pounds every month to access the only medicine that is keeping their children safe, and are now at breaking point over two years since medical cannabis was first legalised in the UK. Only three children with severe epilepsy are in receipt of NHS prescriptions, the remainder have to pay up to £2000 per month to secure private prescriptions. The APPG has written to the Prime Minister urging him to intervene in this ongoing crisis and, until it can be resolved, grant some form of compassionate funding to help these families, because time is rapidly running out and these children are at risk of not being able to receive the proven benefits from taking this life transforming medicine.</p>
<p>The APPG on Agroecology, chaired by Kerry McCarthy MP for Bristol East, Shadow Minister for Green Transport, held a climate meeting with Lord Goldsmith, Minister for the Pacific and Environment. The Minister provided us with an update on his work for COP26, which will be held in the UK in November, and how agroecology fits into the UK Government’s agenda ahead of and beyond COP26. He has been working on domestic, global and international environmental matters. The Minister also spoke about his work on the Environment Bill, which will not complete its passage through the House of Commons before the end of the current Parliamentary session, so will probably be carried over to the next Parliamentary Session which will begin after the Queen’s Speech which is expected in mid-May.</p>
<p>The APPG for Mutuals, chaired by Gareth Thomas, Labour and Co-operative MP for Harrow West, of which I am the treasurer, held its final evidence session into our enquiry regarding the demutualisation of Liverpool Victoria (LV) and its proposed sale to Bain Capital. We heard from Mark Hartigan, Chief Executive of LV and Matt Popoli, Global Head of Insurance at Bain Capital. The APPG are now in the process of compiling a draft report, which will include recommendations, and anticipate that the Final Report will be published in mid-April.</p>
<p>The APPG for Acquired Brain Injury, chaired by Chris Bryant MP for Rhondda, of which I am vice-chair, and whose secretariat is the charity UK Acquired Brain Injury Forum (UKABIF), held a meeting to discuss ABI in relation to sport. We heard from Nigel Huddleston, Minister for Sport, Tourism and Heritage, who was very supportive. Chris has been leading on ABI since forming the APPG.  ABI may result in conditions such as cognitive decline, dementia, and shortened life expectancy. In 2018 our APPG produced the Time for Change report, but we are still waiting for UK Government action. Chris secured a Westminster Hall Debate in February 2020, to raise awareness of ABI in sport, veterans, and homeless people. He has met with Ministers – Jonny Mercer MP (Minister for Armed Forces and Veterans), Michael Gove MP (Minister for the Cabinet Officer) and Victoria Atkins MP (Minister for Safeguarding). Chris tabled amendments to the Domestic Violence Bill relating to the prevalence of undiagnosed ABI in women. Chris has said many times that the APPG and UKABIF will continue to “kick some chins” to ensure that a coordinated approach across government is achieved, so that people with an ABI get the care, opportunities and future they deserve.</p>
<p>The APPG for Hospitality and Tourism, of which I am a vice-chair, held its final evidence session for a green recovery – sustainable hospitality and tourism. With the UK hosting COP26 in November, the eyes of the world will be looking at UK industries and the efforts they are taking to reduce carbon emissions. We heard from Olivia Ruggles-Briese, Director of Greenview; Karina O’Gorman, Head of Corporate Responsibility IMG; Jonathan Webb, Senior Research Fellow IPPR North and Mark Chapman, CEO Zero Carbon Forum, about the challenges and opportunities that a green recovery may bring. Our report and recommendations will be published in mid-April.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired three Westminster Hall Debates on Tuesday afternoon: <em>Proposal for an Outer London Congestion Charge; The 550th Anniversary of the Battle of Barnet 1471; </em>and<em> Improving the Education System after the Covid-19 Outbreak</em>. Whenever I have the privilege to chair Westminster Hall Debates, I am reminded of the broad diversity of topics that MPs bring to the attention of the House, on behalf of their constituents.</p>
<p>I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to speak in a Westminster Hall Debate this week, entitled <em>Implementation of the Rare Diseases Framework</em>, that was secured by Liz Twist MP for Bladen, who is the chair of the APPG for PKU, of which I am the vice-chair. I wasn’t aware of the rare metabolic disorder PKU until my constituents, who suffer with PKU, explained that having PKU prevents them from metabolising PHE which is an amino acid found in protein foods. The standard treatment is a very low PHE diet, removing almost all natural protein which is replaced with prescribed medical dietary proteins to ensure adequate nutrition. The PKU dietary regime is very complex, very restrictive, and very difficult to manage. Every meal, snack, and drink must be planned in advance, and people with PKU and their families spend an average 19 hours every week preparing their diet. If the diet is not strictly followed, a person suffering from PKU can experience isolation, brain fog, iron and vitamin deficiencies, and mental health issues. But the DWP has not accepted that the PKU diet is a “therapy”, so many people with PKU, including my constituents, have been denied the “daily living activities” component of the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) welfare benefit. I explained that a 2020 Tribunal Decision, which ruled that the PKU diet does qualify as a therapy, has given hope to claimants that future PKU PIP applications will be granted. I also paid tribute to the NSPKU charity set up in 1973, run by volunteers with personal experience of PKU, which is also the secretariat for our APPG. Together we have been campaigning since 2008 for the UK Government to prescribe the Biomarin drug Kuvan on the NHS, so that PKU sufferers can take Kuvan, and are then able to eat a normal diet and lead a normal life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has finally made its recommendations on Kuvan, and recommended that it will only be prescribed for children up to the age of 18. Whilst this is to be welcomed, because Kuvan has been available for the past 12 years, it will now create a cliff edge at 18, when teenagers are coping with enough changes to their lives, without being forced to revert back to the strict PKU dietary regime. The NICE recommendations went out for consultation after publishing its guidance on 25th February. The consultation closed on 18th March, and the PKU community has submitted evidence relating to the necessity for Kuvan to be available on NHS prescription for all PKU sufferers irrespective of age, and for further guidance regarding women with PKU who want to start a family. The APPG has also written to Meindert Boysen, Deputy Chief Executive of NICE, about its grave concerns: withdrawing Kuvan at 18; the lack of provision for adults; the contention that the brain stops developing at around 25 years of age; that clinicians are not to prescribe more than 10mg/kg; that pregnant women should be able to access Kuvan; challenges facing mothers of PKU children; and lack of recommendations for PKU sufferers with learning disabilities. We urge the NICE committee to listen carefully to the feedback from the consultation process and revise its guidance to provide Kuvan for all PKU sufferers.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning I attended an update Zoom meeting about the serious coronavirus situation at the DVLA organised by PCS trade union. PCS have been calling on the DVLA to revert to the original position it took at the beginning of the first lockdown in March 2020, where only 500 staff were working in a safe, secure-coronavirus environment on the DVLA Estate, whilst the remainder worked from home. Unfortunately, in the subsequent months, the DVLA insisted that over 2000 of its workers return to work on the estate, resulting in over 600 positive coronavirus cases across the DVLA estate since September 2020, which was the largest workplace outbreak in the UK. PCS has been calling on the DVLA to implement safety measures over the DVLA estate, and allow more staff to work from home, but without success. As a result of the non-action by the DVLA, hundreds of staff at the DVLA will take strike action from Tuesday 6th to Friday 11th April. These will include all operational staff who have been forced to go into workplaces across the DVLA Estate. Action short of strike will be taken by all staff from Saturday 10th April, which includes not working overtime and working to rule, which will not allow the DVLA to call in staff to cover those on strike. PCS will continue to engage in intensive talks with the DVLA next week and re-present its proposals to ensure that staff are safe now and in the future. Taking strike is always a last resort but if the DVLA continues to flagrantly disregard workers’ safety, there is no other choice.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon I joined the APPG on Legal Aid’s Westminster Commission Inquiry into the Sustainability of Legal Aid final evidence session on the experiences of Junior Lawyers, chaired by Karen Buck MP for Westminster North. I was proud to be part of the Bach Commission: Access to Justice set up in September 2015, made up of 13 commissioners from every branch of the legal system, plus legal advisers. We met for the first time in January 2016 and received over 100 written submissions and held many oral evidence sessions featuring legal practitioners and academics. We considered the scope of legal aid and the eligibility rules, and published an Interim Report in November 2016 followed by a Final Report in September 2017. Our findings and recommendations to improve provisions in the sector are set out in the Final Report – <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/xbgwC6XO5CgnoOqFpfUle?domain=fabians.org.uk">The Right To Justice</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the UK Tory Government did not implement any of our recommendations, hence the need for this further commission. In <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/UXLmVYPp0mugVd8cG-UpZrHEAAQRDfyhYmlLUwbqEzzEgmxPwew88WGg4HLJUC-jDlnqzMkX5W8kZ2vE.uAQc3yK_HxGqY6ox?startTime=1616666610000&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=dO4OuZxiT92GQmt3SC1WEA.1616923079798.7939be9b2769e772490a701acba2ddf1&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=547">this session</a> we heard of the experiences of 5 junior lawyers, who entered the profession by very different routes, but when they decided to become lawyers, they shared the same aspiration to become a legal aid lawyer, because they are all dedicated to helping those who are without representation and in desperate need of legal advice. We heard the difficulties of getting into debt when they were becoming qualified, the intense competition of securing a Training Contract or a Pupillage, and the poor remuneration of qualified legal aid lawyers in comparison with lawyers who work for the CPS. The APPG has assembled a group of academics to help analyse the evidence from all the sessions and are also running a connected research project with UCL to gather baseline data about the legal aid workforce, with a view to publishing recommendations for government in Spring/Summer 2021.</p>
<p>I welcomed the news this week that the Welsh Labour Government, working in partnership with Neath Port Talbot and Powys Councils, have confirmed a £50 million capital funding loan to be made available for the Global Centre of Rail Excellence. The Centre will be located on the site of Nant Helen opencast mine and coal washery in Onllwyn. The formal planning application, submitted this week, proposes a purpose-built, modern railway infrastructure, systems and rolling stock test and validation complex. It is hoped the facility will act as a driver for accelerated rail industry innovation, investment and growth in Wales. We know how hard our community has been hit by the economic damage caused by the pandemic, and it’s fantastic to see such investment from the Welsh Labour Government in Neath, in a project that will bring employment and innovation to the area.</p>
<p>This week has been Debt Awareness Week and this year’s campaign is about destigmatising debt. Anyone can fall into debt and during this pandemic, many people who never dreamed they’d be in debt have been forced into debt as a result of the terrible impacts of the pandemic. Talking about money is often difficult and talking about money problems can be even more so. However, it’s vital to take that first step in discussing money problems with family or friends if you don’t yet feel ready to reach out for help. <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/debt-awareness-week.aspx">Step Change</a> have some fantastic advice for those struggling to deal with money worries and stress and can help find the support you need to get out of debt.</p>
<p>As I’m sure you will have seen, Coronavirus restrictions will change this weekend in Wales, with travel now permitted across the nation, the reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation and six people from two different households allowed to meet up outside.  These changes are as a direct result of the work we have all done to stick to the rules and drive the infection rate down, as well as our world leading vaccination programme.  I hope everyone is able to enjoy some long-awaited reunions with friends and family members over the Easter holidays – but please do remember to stick to social distancing rules so that we maintain the progress we have made.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on <a href="mailto:christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk">christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk</a> or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <title>Honda leaves Swindon – a cameo of our time</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/03/28/honda-leaves-swindon-a-cameo-of-our-time/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>      The immediate reason why Honda is closing its Swindon car assembly plant is the lack of demand for its cars throughout Europe. The company’s sales in Europe peaked in 2007 at 313,000 and is now under half that. Contrary to referendum rumours their closure has nothing to do with Brexit. They are also ceasing production in Turkey and do not want any production in Europe for the future.</p>
<p>     The second reason is the EU/Japan trade deal. The prospective ending of 10% tariffs on imported cars from outside the EU will make Japanese produced Hondas in future 10% cheaper. Why not make them in Japan and get greater economies of scale from manufacturing there where they need  output for the home market as well?</p>
<p>      Which brings me to the third reason. Honda needs to launch new models that are all electric for the market of the future. This requires a complete rethink on how you make cars and where you make them. Honda will put  its battery capacity into  Japan and get the economies of scale there for the European market production at the same time. </p>
<p>      This Honda story is a warning to the UK and to other established centres of car production in Europe. The transformation of the car means new plant and new equipment and may well mean a different pattern of industrial location as a result. Brexit was never a threat to the UK car industry. Electrification is. For the UK to keep its current level of capacity and to grow its industry it needs to take bigger strides to invest in and control the raw materials, component production and assembly of the electric cars of the future given the determination of the USA, EU and UK governments to force this transition. Until enough people freely buy electric cars this means the industry investing in advance of demand and government offering suitable assistance to help  make the new products more affordable and acceptable to customers. </p>
<p>    Meanwhile the Honda factory will  become warehouse space. Let’s hope it will not just be filled with more imports. </p>

&lt;p&gt;Deeply saddened and distressed to learn of the sudden death of my great friend &amp;amp; comrade Nigel Todd. Nigel was a socialist who truly loved people &amp;amp; communities, championing their interest &amp;amp; working with people &amp;amp; for them so that they could make their lives better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233393" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Better-buses-2-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Better-buses-2-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Better-buses-2-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Better-buses-2-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Better-buses-2-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Better-buses-2.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;It won’t be news to any of you that bus services in Greater Manchester aren’t good enough. Journeys are too expensive, buses are too infrequent and routes keep getting cut. This leaves most of those who don’t need to use the bus, avoiding it and those with no choice paying over the odds for a poor service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;The reason for all of this is actually very simple and it goes back to the Thatcher Government in the 1980s. As part of their ideological drive to sell off anything that wasn’t nailed to the floor (and even some of that) and to “let the market decide”, they deregulated bus services across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;But not quite all of the country. London was spared from these reforms, which gives us a useful insight into what might have been in Greater Manchester, had deregulation not been pushed through. London buses are more frequent, cheaper and fully integrated with other methods of public transport across the city. For just £1.50, you can swap buses as many times as needed within 90 minutes, all on the same ticket. Similar services would be an absolute game-changer for Greater Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Obviously, that could never happen overnight. There is something of a vicious cycle whereby poor bus services mean fewer people taking the bus which leads to even poorer bus services and so on. It’s vital that we break that cycle and build our bus services back up to something that people choose to use rather than use because they have no choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;For me that means ending this failed model of deregulation once and for all and move towards a new system, which is run for the public good, rather than to maximise private profit at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;There has been a lot of campaigning on this issue, largely led by the fantastic Better Buses for Greater Manchester, and a widespread acknowledgement that what we’ve got at the moment just isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;9 out of the 10 councils in Greater Manchester are (please forgive the pun) on board, with only Tory Bolton looking to stick with the current broken system, and our Metro Mayor Andy Burnham is due to make an announcement this Thursday, so watch this space! We may finally be heading towards the kind of bus system that we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>MP welcomes return date for outdoor education</title>

  <summary type="text">Local MP and co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Outdoor Learning, Tim Farron has welcomed this afternoon's news that the Government have finally published a roadmap for the return of outdoor education.
The Department for Education guidance for educational visits in England says:

Schools may reintroduce outdoor learning and single-day educational visits from Step 2 in the government's roadmap (no earlier than April 12)
Schools can reintroduce domestic residential trips from Step 3 in the government's roadmap (no earlier than May 17)</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Local MP and co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Outdoor Learning, Tim Farron has welcomed this afternoon's news that the Government have finally published a roadmap for the return of outdoor education.</p>
<p>The Department for Education guidance for educational visits in England says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schools may reintroduce outdoor learning and single-day educational visits from Step 2 in the government's roadmap (no earlier than April 12)</li>
<li>Schools can reintroduce domestic residential trips from Step 3 in the government's roadmap (no earlier than May 17)</li>
</ul>
<p>However this announcement contains no financial support despite the devolved governments in Scotland, Northern Ireland and, as of this week, Wales providing millions of pound of sector specific support for outdoor centres in their countries.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"Today's news is a welcome relief for the many outdoor education centres across the Lake District.</em></p>
<p><em>"I've been lobbying ministers on almost a daily basis to give these centres - which do so much good for young people's physical and mental health and employ many dozens of local people - some certainty and confidence to plan for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>"So I'm delighted that ministers have finally listened to us.</em></p>
<p><em>"However I am disappointed that England is the only one of the four nations not to be providing specific financial support to outdoor education centres.</em></p>
<p><em>"This is something I will continue to make the case for in the weeks ahead to help ensure that we don't just save outdoor education centres, but that we deploy them to help reconnect young people with a love of learning."</em></p>

    <title>MV Pentalina should be trialled now says Isles MP</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/03/25/mv-pentalina-should-be-trialled-now-says-isles-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>MV Pentalina should be trialled for use now rather than waiting to be possible relief in the winter period, says Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has been in constant contact with Transport Scotland and Caledonian MacBrayne suggesting the use of the MV Pentalina to ease the strain on the ageing and limited fleet serving the Western Isles.</p>



<p>In response to his correspondence, Transport Scotland has now agreed to ask CalMac to look specifically at the feasibility of using this vessel on the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service network.</p>



<p>CalMac, in correspondence with Mr MacNeil, say they are currently undertaking the 2021/22 overhaul programme including the use of relief vessels with the aim of resolving some of the weather reliability concerns across the most exposed routes.</p>



<p>They say that the deployment of MV Pentalina for short term relief for Winter 2021/22 as well as 2022/23 will be discussed if operational challenges can be overcome.</p>



<p>The broader review for Winter 2022/23 will commence afterwards.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “It is good that Transport Scotland are moving to this position where MV Pentalina is being discussed and looked at.</p>



<p>“I think we now just need to know which ports it can go in and out of, which are the ports where there are little bits of learning to be done.</p>



<p>“It is best for this to be done in a non-pressurised situation. Maybe a trial soon for a week or two down the West Coast of Scotland visiting various ports might be useful and instructive.”</p>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Urgent treatment centre relocates back to PRH from Bridgnorth as pandemic eases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Dunne MP has welcomed local confirmation that the coronavirus pandemic is easing pressure on the NHS in Shropshire, with news that the temporary Urgent Treatment Centre set up at Bridgnorth Hospital will be relocated back to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Urgent Treatment Centre at the PRH had been temporarily relocated last year to Bridgnorth Community Hospital’s Minor Injury Unit (MIU), as the county tackled the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the number of covid cases falling locally, alongside a reduction in the number of people needing treatment in Bridgnorth, the Urgent Treatment Centre will relocate back to the PRH. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MIU at Bridgnorth can still treat are range of minor injuries such as bites, cuts and lacerations, foreign bodies in the eyes, nose and ears, fractures that require plaster only, minor burns and scalds, minor head injuries (with no loss of consciousness), soft tissue injuries such as sprains and bruises, and wound infections. People with major injuries and illnesses, such as head injuries and breathing difficulties should still attend A&amp;E.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr Dunne said: “With the number of people in our acute hospitals with covid continuing to fall, local cases reducing, and the vaccination programme well underway, moving the Urgent Treatment Centre back to the PRH is a sign that we are getting through this pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We cannot be complacent, and new variants present a risk – but the return to some sense of normality is helped by removing these temporary measures set up to help the NHS deal with the worst of the pandemic. While I would like to see the hospital upgraded to an Urgent Treatment Centre  permanently, as previously hoped for, this is not going to happen for now, so I would like to thank all those in the NHS who have worked in the UTC while it was at Bridgnorth, and for the continued efforts of NHS staff and volunteers to keep us all healthy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Karin Smyth MP is reminding all constituents about the All About Jobs &amp;amp; Apprenticeships series of events that she is organising with Bristol City Council, the City of Bristol College, and the DWP on Thursday this week (25 March) from 3pm until 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Three online webinars will provide information about finding jobs and apprenticeships, as well as offer career support and guidance during this difficult time.

&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There will be three sessions held:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;3.00pm – 4.00pm A focus on getting a job where a group of experts will discuss how to go about looking for a job, the help and support that is available to you in your job search, and the types of jobs that are waiting to be filled at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;4.00pm – 5.00pm A focus on apprenticeships for people to learn more about finding apprenticeships and what they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;5.00pm – 6.00pm A focus on Health and Social Care will discuss how to pursue or progress a career in the health and social care sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“This year has been incredibly challenging for the labour market and so many people have struggled to find jobs and training during this difficult time. We know how daunting a job search can be and are pleased to offer this webinar with experts who are able to offer support and guidance for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Apprenticeships are an undervalued way into the workplace, and I hope that young people and those looking for new opportunities will join us during this webinar to find out more. I hope to see as many people as possible taking advantage of these fantastic seminars with experts and representatives from different sectors, who will be providing some excellent advice about pursuing your path into employment.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP has responded to the protest by Extinction Rebellion and Labour over the policing Bill.</p>



<p>John said: &#8220;The question for Extinction Rebellion and the Labour Party is why they want to stop some really important changes that matter hugely to everybody else in and around Weston.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example, the bill gives our local police long-needed powers to deal with the illegal traveller encampments which we get every summer in local parks or the seafront.</p>



<p>&#8220;It increases sentences for people who attack emergency workers like ambulance crews or firefighters. It stops sexual predators in positions of trust like sports coaches from exploiting young girls and boys.</p>



<p>“Why on earth do Extinction Rebellion and the Labour Party want to stop these things? Everyone agrees we need to preserve the right for peaceful, democratic debate and&nbsp;protests, but they’re so intent on organising political demonstrations with roadblocks that bring towns and cities to a halt that they’ve forgotten the rest of us have families we want to keep safe, and communities which need essential services to work properly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m happy to work with them to make sure their right to&nbsp;protest&nbsp;is maintained, but they’ve got to realise in return that this bill fixes some really important problems that local people have been asking for, for ages.”</p>

Who would have thought at the beginning of last year that, in only a few months’ time, we’d be in a nation-wide lockdown to protect ourselves from a global pandemic? It’s been tough on everyone – keeping apart from loved ones, not going out to work, studying and learning from home. Businesses have been placed under enormous pressure, many of which are only still going today on account of the generous support the government has provided in the form of staff furloughs and other grants and loans.</p>
<p>Most tragically of all, we all know people who have lost friends and family. And we mourn them all.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also aspects of the last year we will look back on with pride. The way Welwyn Hatfield has pulled together. The resilience our local NHS staff have shown when working at any and all hours in the battle against this virus. Local charities and volunteers like Sarah Jamieson of Resolve, who literally moved in with the homeless people she was helping to find accommodation during lockdown. And, of course, all those involved in the Herculean effort that is our vaccination roll-out, some of whom I had the pleasure of meeting when I had my first jab at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One year and three lockdowns later, the remarkable rollout of our vaccine programme means that we’re now able to look forward to a cautious but final route back to normality. Well over 50% of all adults in the UK have now been vaccinated – no other major economy in the world has vaccinated its population faster. We know it will take time for things to get back to normal, but thanks to the fortitude of the people of Welwyn Hatfield, as well as the hard work of our scientists, our brilliant NHS workers, our military and the army of volunteers across the entire country, we are embarking upon the journey to recovery.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The number of unemployed claimants in Dagenham and Rainham constituency in February 2021 was 6,860.</strong> This represents a rate of 9.8% of the economically active population aged 16 to 64. The equivalent UK claimant rate was 6.5%. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>There are 4170 more claimants than in February 2020 before the UK lockdown began and 490 more claimants than January 2021. </strong>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Figures are not seasonally adjusted and are rounded to the nearest five. “Unemployed claimants” include people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance or who are claiming Universal Credit and are required to seek work.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>Long term trends             </strong>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The unadjusted claimant count is currently <strong>not a good indicator of long- term trends</strong> in the number of people looking for work. It does however provide us with a <strong>measure of how the number of claimants has changed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</strong> The adjusted alternative claimant count <strong>is updated on a quarterly basis.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>The ongoing impact of coronavirus on Universal Credit</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Under Universal Credit, a broader spectrum of people are required to look for work than under Jobseeker’s Allowance. This has the effect of increasing the number of unemployed claimants. In addition to this, as part of the government’s response to Coronavirus (COVID-19), a number of enhancements were introduced to Universal Credit. Consequently, whilst some of the increase in the unemployed claimant count will be due to people who have become unemployed, some will also be due to employed people who have become eligible for Universal Credit as part of the government response to Coronavirus.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>Jon Cruddas MP: </strong>
                <strong>
                  <em>"The pandemic is still ongoing, pulling more and more individuals into financial hardship. The Government must address these figures and the high levels of constituents on Furlough. Although the Furlough scheme has been a lifeline for many residents across Dagenham and Rainham, it has not been without its flaws. It is vital that a plan is in place for when the Furlough scheme comes to an end. I will continue lobbying from the opposition benches to ensure that my constituents get the support they need."</em>

<p>Last week First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that two woodlands will be created in North and South Wales in memory of those who have sadly died from coronavirus during the pandemic.</p>



<p>So today, as we tune in to the National Coronavirus Commemorative Event to be broadcast at 5 pm from the steps of the Senedd, we could also reflect on how we may wish to create a place closer to home as a permanent memorial where families and others can come to remember all those we have lost. </p>



<p>This is something we should plan together as a community, so Lee Waters MS and I would be very pleased to hear your thoughts on this.     A minute’s silence will also be held at midday to mark the National Day of Reflection and a doorstep vigil, with torches or candles, at 8pm tonight.</p>

    <title>Local MP welcomes BT’s ‘Adopt a Kiosk’ scheme as a great way to house community defibrillators</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11221" src="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/defib-at-holmpton-g-in-the-phone-box-23.1.16-740x1113.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="1113" srcset="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/defib-at-holmpton-g-in-the-phone-box-23.1.16-740x1113.jpg 740w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/defib-at-holmpton-g-in-the-phone-box-23.1.16-300x451.jpg 300w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/defib-at-holmpton-g-in-the-phone-box-23.1.16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"/></p>
<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, has welcomed BT’s exciting ‘Adopt a Kiosk’ initiative and the opportunities it presents for giving the iconic red phone boxes a new lease of life.</p>
<p>Under this scheme, recognised local authorities such as District, Borough, Parish and Town Councils, along with registered charities, have the chance to purchase their own red telephone box from BT for just £1.</p>
<p>The reason for the scheme is that advances in mobile phone technology have left the notable old phone boxes underused. According to BT, over half of all red telephone boxes in the UK have been removed or disconnected.</p>
<p>Eleven kiosks are up for adoption in Beverley in Holderness, located in: Atwick; Lund; South Dalton; Holme-on-the-Wolds; Etton; Tickton; Keyingham; Aldbrough; Patrington; Sunk Island; and Roos.</p>
<p>Graham said “The old red phone box is a cultural icon, one of the few pieces of street furniture we got right in the 20th century. They are a wonderful part of our local landscape and, I think, look really great when they’re refurbished and put to a new use: they can be a mini library for the community, a little museum or, my favourite, house a public access defibrillator.”</p>
<p>As Chair of CADEY (Community Access Defibrillators for East Yorkshire) Graham looks forward to working with any community that is looking to use their old telephone box to host a defibrillator and save lives.</p>
<p>Roughly 30,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals every year, but currently only 3,000 people survive because of how important it is to get immediate, on-the-scene treatment. Every minute without treatment reduces someone’s chances of survival by approximately 10%. Graham added, “In my view, with their bright red appearance, along with their central location, these boxes are well-suited to housing a defib which can be used in minutes on someone in cardiac arrest and save a life; every second counts. “</p>

    <title>Preet alerts Government to holes in plans to fix the cladding crisis </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-alerts-government-holes-plans-fix-cladding-crisis" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham has written to the Government’s Building Safety Minister pointing out the glaring omissions to their plans when it comes to protecting leaseholders from exorbitant fire safety costs. </p>
<p>While the Government asserts that they have told building owners and industry that they should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders, that is not what is happening to the hundreds of thousands of leaseholders who are being caught up in this crisis. </p>
<p>In her letter to Lord Greenhalgh, Ms Gill provides the clear example from her constituency of Hemisphere Apartments. The building has a number of fire safety issues that require urgent remedial work that is estimated to cost £13.8 million – roughly £40,000 per flat. Like the 100 other buildings in Birmingham, last year they applied to the Government’s Building Safety Fund but are yet to receive a penny of funding. </p>
<p>Citing comments from the developer of Hemisphere Apartments, Redrow plc, which noted that the company had set aside £20m to support “half a dozen or so legacy schemes” with cladding costs, Ms Gill wrote to them on behalf of her constituents to ask for support to get remedial works off the ground. </p>
<p> Redrow has responded to pleas for help for leaseholders saying “Redrow is not prepared to offer any financial support at this stage”, citing “the Secretary of State’s commitment to fund necessary fire safety works on high-rise buildings, and to recover the costs through levies and taxes on developers such as ourselves” as one of the reasons why they won’t help. </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston said, “This exchange shows exactly how leaseholders are caught between a rock and a hard place. </p>
<p>“Four years on from the Grenfell tragedy, the Government’s building safety plan is still failing to get remediation works off the ground, while leaseholders in my constituency are paying out hundreds of thousands of pounds in waking watch fees and skyrocketing insurance premiums while they wait. </p>
<p>“Today, there are votes in the House of Commons on amendments to the Fire Safety Bill which would protect leaseholders from having to pay to fix a crisis they didn’t create. It is crucial for leaseholders right across the UK that MPs stand up for what is right to protect the innocent leaseholders.” </p>

    <title>Debbie welcomes Dame Julie Walters’ Support on Dementia Research Funding</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/debbie-welcomes-dame-julie-walters-support-on-dementia-research-funding/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>As Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, I welcome Dame Julie Walters’ support in calling on the Government to deliver on its election promise to double funding for dementia research.</p>
<p>This comes as Alzheimer’s Research UK reveals 94% of dementia researchers are very concerned progress is at risk due to fewer funding opportunities. While new polling from the charity has highlighted that UK adults think the pledge made during the 2019 election is important, very few believe government will follow through on its word.</p>
<p>This week the UK’s leading dementia research charity has revealed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over three quarters (77%) of the public believe the Government’s pledge to increase its funding for dementia research to over £160 million a year is either still important (59%) or more important (18%) since the coronavirus outbreak.</li>
<li>One in five people (18%) think it is even more important because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen people with dementia among the hardest hit.</li>
<li>Despite this, only 7% of people believe the Government will deliver on the promise made during the 2019 election.</li>
<li>Yet the charity says the funding is more critical than ever before, as a separate survey shows one in five researchers are considering leaving, or have already left, dementia research due to COVID-19 – while more than a third (34%) are considering leaving research altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am delighted to see Dame Julie pressing the Government to keep the promise it made to the public.  I wrote to the Prime Minister in November urging him to keep his promise on the dementia ‘moonshot’ and also to the Chancellor last month, ahead of the Budget.  Unfortunately neither have yet replied and I share the concern of those surveyed that the Government will break its promise.</p>
<p>Like many people, including Dame Julie, I have family experience of dementia – my mother had Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. I know just how important research is into understanding the condition and looking for treatments to prevent, slow, and ultimately cure diseases that cause dementia.</p>
<p>It’s been well over a year since the government pledged to boost dementia research, after this was included in the Conservative 2019 General Election manifesto. But with no indication that this funding is to be delivered, it’s time for action.</p>
<p>While it’s right that the response to the pandemic has had to take priority, dementia is not just the UK but the world’s greatest long-term health crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the lives of people affected by dementia and their carers have been devastated, with a staggering 34,000 people with dementia estimated to have died from coronavirus since March 2020. The search for life-changing dementia treatments has never been more critical.</p>
<p>Our life sciences sector both in academia and industry showed what we can do together in response to Covid-19. In the same way, I believe we can lead the world in finding cures for the diseases which cause dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Dame Julie Walters said: </strong></p>
<p>“As someone who witnessed the effects of dementia growing up, I am proud to be standing with the tens of thousands of people who are calling on government to deliver on its election promise to double investment into researching the condition. My grandmother had vascular dementia and she lived with us when we were kids. We didn’t really understand her symptoms, but we all loved her to bits. I still don’t know how my mother coped having to care for her and look after three young children.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that over half of us know someone affected by dementia, yet there are no treatments to slow, stop or prevent it. Far too many families are being forced to experience the pain dementia causes on a daily basis because of the lack of treatments and to put it simply, enough is enough.</p>
<p>“There is an urgent need for research to bring about life-changing treatments for people affected by dementia. With the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on those with the condition, the funding promised by government is more critical now than it ever has been and it’s clear the public agrees. I’d urge everyone to sign this petition, so we can make it clear to government that we will not let their promise be cast aside.”</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2021/03/action-to-help-young-carers-in-worcester/"><![CDATA[<p>Local MP Robin Walker has called on businesses in Worcester to help young carers into work to mark Young Carers Action Day. Robin met with a group of young carers on Friday (March 12<sup>th</sup>) in a meeting organised by the organisation Worcestershire Young Carers. He heard about the challenges young carers face and learned about the many skills young carers can offer employers.</p>
<p>The meeting took place as YSS Worcestershire Young Carers joined other young carers organisations across the UK to raise awareness during Young Carers Action Day 2021. The event, organised by Carers Trust, has been running for 6 years and is dedicated to highlighting the impact that being a carer can have on young people. This year, the event feels particularly important due to the significant impact that the covid19 pandemic has had on all young people but particularly those already made vulnerable by being a carer.</p>
<p>Robin said:</p>
<p>“When I met with young carers in my constituency on Friday I was overwhelmingly impressed by their commitment and will do all I can to help.</p>
<p>“I call on all businesses in my constituency to consider the skills a young carer have to offer. Sacrificing their own time to look after a loved takes a great deal of maturity and in the process, young people inevitably learn many of the transferable skills that employers are often looking for during the recruitment process.</p>
<p>“Worcester Sixth Form College assists young carers with their responsibilities with a Designated Young Carers Lead. Worcestershire Young Carers are campaigning to get that support for every school. I will be liaising with colleagues in government to see how we can support this.”</p>
<p>Jon Cawdron, Team Manager WYC, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This day, is the most important in our calendar in terms of placing a spotlight on what it is to be a young carer and the impact it can have. We are thrilled to be using it to not only raise awareness of the ways that young people in a care role can be marginalised and have fewer life chances but also to highlight the skills that many of them have developed and the maturity they demonstrate in undertaking their roles. They are heroes and this day gives them a chance to show off their superpowers.”</p>
<p>Funded by BBC Children in Need, The Worcestershire Young Carers Participation Group meets regularly to highlight the needs of young carers, and helps get their voices heard by organisations and services that affect them.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It’s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

    <title>Nottingham City Council Budget 2021/22</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/03/08/nottingham-city-council-budget-2021-22/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham Labour will agree a package of budget proposals to establish a sustainable financial footing amid the Covid crisis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This budget comes during an extremely difficult time for the people of Nottingham, the nation as a whole and the council. The impacts of Covid have been devastating. The health effects coupled with the economic situation has dealt a blow to many of our residents. During this most difficult time for our City the council has stepped up to support our most vulnerable residents and taken on new responsibilities ranging from getting every rough sleeper into safe accommodation to administering tens of millions of pounds worth of business grants to help small employers through the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham City Council has had to make over £271m of budget savings between 2010/11 and 2019/20, and during the current pandemic has had to deal with £25.9m unreimbursed Covid response costs and loss of income. We are having to take difficult decisions in this budget which includes £15.6m of savings.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Proposals include some service changes, as well as a workforce reduction of 272 full-time equivalent posts – 109 of which have been held vacant. We will also be implementing the Government’s proposed 3% social care precept towards the rising costs of care services for elderly and vulnerable adults, which now accounts for over 35% of the council’s net budget.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last couple of months we have been listening to the feedback on draft budget proposals and will be making a few changes as a result. We will be:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrapping the staffing reduction to the Missing Children’s Team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrapping the proposed 30p charge for public toilets in the City.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing the grants to arts and cultural venues with a much smaller 15% funding reduction rather than the 37% that had been considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many proposals in today’s budget that we are bringing reluctantly. To avoid similar decisions in the future we need the Government to change course.  We will be using Full Council today to call on the Government to urgently address a number of issues which will be significant for the Council’s budget and financial stability over the coming years including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The need to bring forward the promised Green Paper on Adult Social Care with a funding model that does not rely on continued increases in Council tax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services for vulnerable children where provider pricing nationally is spiralling – Nottingham City Council is facing an estimated additional cost pressure of more than £12m over the coming year&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further support for  businesses and employment services which will be&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>High Speed Rail Bridge Consultation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://liambyrne.co.uk/high-speed-rail-bridge-consultation/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;img width="150" height="150" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HS2-image-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important information about new High Speed (HS2) bridges at Saltley viaduct and the Aston Church Road&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I need your help putting forward views about two new bridges being built for HS2 &lt;strong&gt;at Saltley Viaduct and the Aston Church Road, as they will cut road links for a year, beginning in mid-2022.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the new High Speed 2 rail line is a game changer for our area. A train journey to Manchester will take just 41 minutes and a trip to London will take 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is expected to create jobs, jobs, jobs: thousands of new jobs around the new station at Birmingham International &amp;#8211; and thousands more in the city centre &amp;#8211; plus up to 3,600 jobs at the new business park I’ve fought for at the old LDV-Alstom site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, building the line will cause disruption not least because the bridges at Saltley Viaduct and Aston Church Road have to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lot of work has already gone into replacement plans and timing of the construction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can fill in the consultation survey online by going to&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/HS2-Saltley-KDE/
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or if you don’t have the internet call the freephone number on 08081 434 434.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to check out the new HS2 Jobs Board https://www.hs2.org.uk/supply-chain-jobs&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve battled hard over five years in Parliament to make sure HS2 works for us. This is a big bit of new infrastructure for us and I’m anxious we get it right. So please make sure you have your say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Commenting, Mark Pritchard MP said:</p>
<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

    <title>How to write a script for an e-course</title>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more facts, and to find out what this multi-million-pound government investment in our local NHS will mean for you and your family, visit the following website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk/faq"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk/faq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>Welcoming the Fantastic Ryanair Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianpaisleymp.co.uk/2016/01/11/welcoming-the-fantastic-ryanair-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br/>
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br/>
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br/>
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br/>
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br/>
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br/>
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br/>
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br/>
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
