      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yesterday the Commons passed the latest pandemic controls, which had been introduced the previous night. As always the Opposition parties all wanted the current controls and recommended more. The Conservative benches were more divided, with a minority questioning the value and wisdom of these further restrictions on our liberties.</p>
<p>We have now seen that a Labour government in Cardiff and an SNP government in Edinburgh have  not been more successful than England at getting case and hospital rates down more and keeping them down by enforcing stricter regulations for longer. The controls are  now going on around the world against air travel from southern Africa where the latest variant was first detected, only to discover that the new mutant has already broken out and is present in countries around the world well beyond southern Africa. Some think this new mutant is likely to spread more rapidly but to be mild. Let us hope it is not a new lethal killer.</p>
<p>I have raised  the issues of whether the NHS has now improved airflows, introduced more UV filters and cut the chances of cross infection. I have also asked about better treatments. During the debate others raised the question of why past forecasts of rising case numbers and deaths have often been inaccurate, how much virus the masks do actually contain and whether these rules will be lifted before Christmas when Parliament is no longer in session.</p>
<p>The NHS senior management needs to make sure the pace and distribution of more vaccinations is fair and achievable and tell us more about treatments and infection control.</p>

    <title>Omicron changes to COVID regulations, Westminster, 30 Nov 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2021/11/30/omicron-changes-to-covid-regulations-westminster-30-nov-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The Omicron variant should be a reminder that no one is safe until everyone is safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="COVID regulations in reaction to omicron" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20gxLj37GVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I first of all would like to just say Happy Saint Andrews Day to all Scots across the Parliamentary Estate whether born in Scotland or adopted Scots like myself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obviously we&amp;#8217;re here to talk about this new variant of concern Omicron and it&amp;#8217;s quite clear that we&amp;#8217;re in the early days of this, and we need more research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it is a heavily mutated variant, and looking at the mutations, it includes mutations that do suggest increased transmitability, and also mutations that are associated with immune escape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s causing the concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We see cases surging in South Africa, but we do not yet have proof that those surges are directly related to Omicron. One thing that has emerged from South Africa is evidence of re-infection of people with previous proven COVID infections. And that&amp;#8217;s something that we haven&amp;#8217;t seen so often during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To respond to the member for Altrincham and Sale West, I would have to say, he talks about people&amp;#8217;s freedom to choose what they do, but the person they might infect actually has the choice removed from them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Particularly people who are immuno-suppressed, or who are vulnerable. It is a network. And, if you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen that little GIF &amp;#8211; where someone drops a pingpong ball onto mousetraps &amp;#8211; you will realise the way things spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;YOU may have a choice; I, as an immuno-suppressed person, may therefore not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: Isn&amp;#8217;t exactly the same thing true of flu?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The thing is, we don&amp;#8217;t suffer the same deaths, hospitalisations or outcome from flu. We don&amp;#8217;t. If you look at 170,000 deaths over the last 18 months in the UK. We certainly have bad flu winters, where we can get up in the teens, towards 20,000, but we have never got close to 170,000 over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: She&amp;#8217;s referring to a period when we didn&amp;#8217;t have vaccination; am I not right in thinking that in a vaccinated population, the case fatality rate of COVID is not actually remarkably different from that of influenza.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are actually still seeing hospitalisations and deaths in people who are double vaccinated. The reason that we are delivering boosters in all 4 health services is because that immunity is waning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;#8217;re concerned about with omicron, is if it is able to immune escape, it could push us backwards. We simply don&amp;#8217;t want it to become re-established, and undermine the achievement that vaccines have made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, things like masks, and hand-washing, which were reviewed in the British Medical Journal, it showed that masks had as BIG an impact as hand-hygiene, so surely we should be doing both. And, both of them have no major economic impact. You&amp;#8217;re not talking about locking down; you&amp;#8217;re not talking about shutting businesses. You&amp;#8217;re talking about everyone trying to protect everyone else.- So that they can continue to be active; can continue to be out in society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to remember that if our current vaccines were shown to be less effective against omicron,that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean they would have no impact. We already see that impact on delta with regards spread, where the reduction is only about 50%. It has markedly reduced hospitalisation and death. We would therefore be still hoping for that with omicron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, pushing vaccination, encouraging people to get boosted, remains as important as it always was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delta is still by far the most dominant variant circulating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no evidence as yet of differing symptoms or severity, but one of the weaknesses of the data we have from South Africa is the initial outbreaks were in students, and therefore young people already tend to get milder infections, and we don&amp;#8217;t yet know what omicron will be like in an older or more vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We do have one advantage in its diagnosis.&lt;br&gt;That is that the S-gene, one of the 3 genes looked for in common PCR tests, is missing in omicron. Rather than having to wait for genomic testing, which takes quite a long time, you get a heads up, or an early warning, on that PCR test, that you&amp;#8217;ve got this sub-group with S-gene dropout, which means the chances are it could be omicron. These patients could be warned. These samples can then be sent for full genomic testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Scotland it&amp;#8217;s a retrospective review of recent PCR results, looking for S-gene dropout, that&amp;#8217;s identified the 9 patients in Scotland. I assume similiar work is happening in the other nations across the UK. In contact tracing of the 9, there&amp;#8217;s no evidence of connections either to COP26, or to the South African rugby game. But, of course tracking continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This does mean that PCR testing is even more important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lateral flow tests (which we are all doing, hopefully, on a regular basis before coming here) can&amp;#8217;t detect variants. It is a simple yes/no that you do yourself. There&amp;#8217;s no access to take further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lateral flow tests had been allowed as part of the travel testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, they tested 600 passengers arriving from South Africa.&lt;br&gt;And found 1 in 10 had COVID. That is an incredibly high incidence. Much higher than what we have anywhere in the UK.&lt;br&gt;And a fifth of those were already omicron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Omicron is not just in Southern Africa, it&amp;#8217;s not just in the UK.&lt;br&gt;Because of the use of lateral flow tests, it&amp;#8217;s probably more widespread than we think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I therefore welcome that the government has returned today to PCR testing, rather than lateral flow, for travellers, and is quickly re-establishing quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They should have a PCR test before they travel.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rather shutting the stable door.&lt;br&gt;If you find someone&amp;#8217;s positive, when they&amp;#8217;ve just spent 8 hours on a plane with hundreds of other people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: Is she not concerned there is too much emphasis on PCR testing, for tracking variants of concern.&lt;br&gt;Over a 3 week period in July, there were 500,000 PCR tests, 7,000 tested positive for COVID, and 5% of those 7,000 were tested for variants of concern.&lt;br&gt;So, it&amp;#8217;s not quite the silver bullet on variants of concern that she might hope it would be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t claiming it was, because genomic testing takes a couple of weeks, and therefore you are too late to isolate.&lt;br&gt;What I&amp;#8217;m saying is that in THIS variant, as in alpha, but not in delta, there is this missing S-gene which means that in the initial test, which is taking 6 hours, or the next day, you are already getting a heads-up that you&amp;#8217;re dealing with a case of omicron. You then can go on and do the genomic analysis.&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#8217;re already able to reply to that patient, and say &amp;#8220;We think you have this variant. You need to isolate; you need to isolate thoroughly; you need to isolate longer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: I don&amp;#8217;t know what magic goes on within the lateral flow test; we put the drips on one end, and the band, one band hopefully, appears and not two.&lt;br&gt;Could the lateral flow test be adapted to be specific for this type of variant?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re talking abour redesigning for a whole new antigen. It&amp;#8217;s just one of the advantages from the PCR. PCR is looking at genes; that is basically what it&amp;#8217;s doing; I&amp;#8217;m not going to talk about what PCR stands for, we&amp;#8217;re given this little advantage that is a benefit to us, that we already get that heads-up, I don&amp;#8217;t think it is feasible in any reasonable time scale to change lateral flow tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;#8217;re lucky that this one has S-gene drop out and we will get an early warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the issues about only focussing on a day 2 PCR, and if you are negative you are then released, unlike what is being discussed for domestic isolation, is that the incubation period for COVID, generally, is much longer than 2 days.&lt;br&gt;It has generally been reported as an average of 5 days and can extend up to longer than that. There&amp;#8217;s a real danger that if you have arrived in the UK, and you may have had contact, you get a negative PCR day 2, and you go about your business, but actually its false reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why the Scottish and Welsh governments have asked for a COBRA meeting to debate the evidence that is there, on a 4 nation basis, and discuss about having 8 day isolation for travellers, with a day 8 test being negative required before people could release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister should listen to that. One of the issues we had in Scotland when we tried to maintain stricter and broader hotel quarantine is the majority of long-haul passengers arrive through hubs such as Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The devolved nations have no ability to have an impact on that.&lt;br&gt;We should be looking at trying, at working with the Republic of Ireland, to have the whole Common Travel Area safer from the point of view of how we move about inside it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: Since she is speaking on behalf of the SNP, and with the (censure) debate later, I presume the SNP will be supporting the government when the vote comes forward at the end of this debate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason my colleagues are not here, this debate is largely about the regulations within England, we don&amp;#8217;t normal vote on English matters; we haven&amp;#8217;t normally voted on your COVID regulations.&lt;br&gt;The one aspect is this around testing and isolation of travellers, so we support it.&lt;br&gt;We just think it should go further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With regards to domestic precautions, Scotland never got rid of mandatory masks.&lt;br&gt;On public transport, in shops, and in schools.&lt;br&gt;What we haven&amp;#8217;t heard the minister refer to is are they planning to reintroduce mask wearing in schools.&lt;br&gt;At the moment, with vaccination, and its impact, what we&amp;#8217;re seeing is that the bulge and peak of cases is moving down and is in younger and younger teenagers and primary school children among those who are unvaccinated. If it is not masks in schools, is there a plan to install CO2 monitoring; is there a plan to install ventilation, how do we reduce the incidence in schools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: What is her assessment of the impact in Scotland on mask wearing? In the case of younger children, is it not testament to how well we&amp;#8217;ve done at keeping them apart. And proof that we cannot hide from the virus when we come back together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s difficult, cases go up and down, we swap positions, at the moment Scotland has the lowest incidence, at 349 per 100,000; NI has the highest at well over 600 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have whole baskets of measures, it is harder, other than in the review that the Royal Society published last June, and in the BMJ paper of just a week ago, to pick out exactly which measures are having the impact.&lt;br&gt;The BMJ found masks and hand hygiene were equal in their impact, and bigger in their impact than physical distancing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They enable people to engage, and enable vulnerable to feel safe to come out, otherwise those who were shielding are going to be stuck in their houses all over again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While mask wearing wasn&amp;#8217;t mandatory in England, it still remained in the guidance of this government. If in a busy public space. That guidance has been undermined by the demonstration, on TV, every day, of members on the government benches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, when we came back in the autumn, there were approximately 5 people who wore masks; then it more than doubled, to 14. And, after it was being pushed, it&amp;#8217;s about two-thirds.&lt;br&gt;That means about one-third of members, of the Government, when mask wearing in busy places is meant to be promoted are still not wearing masks.&lt;br&gt;People will be led by example.&lt;br&gt;Not just the PMs but every others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the non-sensical claim by the Leader of the House that you cannot catch COVID from friends.&lt;br&gt;Words fail me. And that, as you can well believe, is not a common occurance.&lt;br&gt;It is clear that the commonest spread is within households.&lt;br&gt;If the Leader of the House thinks that husbands and wives and children are not friendly with each other, I really worry about his home circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is early days but we should be following a precautionary approach.&lt;br&gt;As Dr. Ryan of the WHO has always said &amp;#8220;Go early, and go hard.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the last 3 waves, the government often delayed making decision until the problem was proven. I welcome the changes they are making, to try and be ahead of the curve this time.&lt;br&gt;As well as masks, they should advise those who can easily work from home to do so.&lt;br&gt;They should be promoting &amp;#8220;Hands; Face; Space&amp;#8221; again, to push that to people who maybe go a little complacent.&lt;br&gt;They should be looking at how to support the installation and improvement of ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID is airborne. If you remember before the smoking ban, how smoke used to hang in a pub.&lt;br&gt;If any of you ever worked in pubs, as I did as a student, smoke was still hanging there the next morning.&lt;br&gt;That is the issue around poorly ventilated spaces.&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve seen it in this house in the outbreaks associated with committee rooms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, to finish, the arrival of such a variant was inevitable.&lt;br&gt;Last spring, we heard warm words about a global response to a global crisis.&lt;br&gt;While over 85% of adults in the UK have been double vaccinated, it&amp;#8217;s less than 4% of those in low income countries.&lt;br&gt;Including many who have not been able to vaccinate their health care workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intervention: The evolution of an immune escape variant which maybe omicron is…&lt;br&gt;does that occur because of the vaccination of an immune population, or because of a naive population.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s emergence in Southern Africa would suggest a naive population. One of the issues around the complacency and reliance on vaccinations here, while allowing very high case numbers, using Darwinism, you can be pre-selecting for vaccine resistant variants and mutations.&lt;br&gt;Those are the ones that will get a grip.&lt;br&gt;The vaccine succeptible will not because we are so vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;Allowing high spread, which means common mutations, is a problem wherever it is.&lt;br&gt;In the naive populations in the global south, there is a real danger.&lt;br&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t have testing, they don&amp;#8217;t have the materials, they don&amp;#8217;t have genomics, they don&amp;#8217;t have vaccines.&lt;br&gt;The danger is you get a variant that is building up, and then eventually will come to Europe, to the UK.&lt;br&gt;Sending occasional batches, that are almost out of date, as reported recently to the APPG on Coronavirus, doesn&amp;#8217;t allow government in the global south to prepare and use those vaccines in date.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK is still among the countries blocking a TRIPS waiver.&lt;br&gt;We must realise that its not just a matter of sharing some leftover doses; we need to massively increase global production. Sharing intellectual property. Sharing technological expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This variant should be a reminder that no one is safe until everyone is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lizkendall.org/liz-meets-with-hammersmith-and-fulham-council/"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I met with Cllr Ben Coleman and Lisa Redfern from Hammersmith and Fulham Council. Cllr Coleman is the Cabinet Member for Health and Adult Social Care in Hammersmith and Fulham and Lisa is the Director of Adult Social Care for the council.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a really interesting meeting discussing some of the great work that has been done in Hammersmith and Fulham since the council became Labour controlled in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We talked about the free home care policy provided by the council and Labour&#8217;s approach nationally to social care.</p>
<p>Labour councils face huge challenges after a decade of cuts to their budgets and the Government&#8217;s ongoing failure to support social care, but they continue to do amazing work for the people they represent.&nbsp;</p>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has slammed the planned closure of the TSB Denton Branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Gwynne was informed by TSB representatives that the Denton Branch will close on the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2022. The bank has cited a decline in in-person banking exacerbated by the pandemic as part of the reason behind the closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be one of 70 branches to shut by the end of June, leaving just 220 across the UK. This marks a decline of over 250 in just one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closure of the TSB Branch in Denton will leave the Halifax on Manchester Road as the only bank in Denton Town Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting on the planned closure, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very disappointed that TSB have taken the decision to close this branch. I understand that the number of customers banking in-person has decreased, but I feel very strongly that the presence of a local bank is important for customers and residents right across the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision will leave just one bank in Denton Town Centre. We are progressively losing access to in-person banking, and I’m concerned about the effect that this will have on those who don’t have access to online banking, or just prefer to see someone face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are important parts of our local high streets, and I would implore TSB to reconsider this short-sighted decision.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>My Article in the Nov-Dec Neighbourhood Watch Magazine</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/my-article-in-the-nov-dec-neighbourhood-watch-magazine/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Residents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing of the interest that local residents have shown in the future of Aldridge Police Station I wanted to update you on my most recent engagement with Simon Foster, our new Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) who was elected in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to be able to meet virtually with Mr Foster, and I congratulated him on his new role.  I also pressed him on the matter of our local police station, urging him to drop the previous PCC’s plan to close Aldridge Police Station.  In setting out the arguments for this I included the strength of feeling locally on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the plan to close our Police Station remains on the table the new Commissioner has agreed that there should be a consultation. Although I welcome Mr Foster’s decision to consult, we all remember that the former Strategic Policing and Crime Board also agreed to consult, and no plan ever came forward. For this reason I will judge the decision taken by this Police and Crime Commissioner to consult the people of Aldridge by his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any consultation on the future of our local Police Station must be meaningful. It must be inclusive and must seek to ensure we retain a local police base on the eastern flank of the Walsall Borough. The residents and local businesses of Aldridge deserve to keep a local Police base and we need to retain a Police Station in the Village of Aldridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to another issue which has kept us preoccupied locally &amp;#8211; constituency boundaries. As many of you will be aware the Boundary Commission for England consulted over the summer about proposed changes to the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the Commission proposed splitting the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency in two and creating a new Walsall constituency and a new Bloxwich and Brownhills constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included within their proposal is the proposition of splitting the Village of Aldridge in half and placing Aldridge Central and South in the Walsall constituency and Aldridge North and Walsall Wood in the Bloxwich and Brownhills constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have opposed these proposals and I am grateful to everyone who sent submissions to the Boundary Commission for England and signed my petition to ‘Keep Aldridge Together’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial consultation was the first stage of the process. The Boundary Commission for England will now consider the objections they have received and produce revised proposals early in 2022. I will of course continue to keep you all updated on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I would like to also update you that the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill has now passed all its stages in the House of Commons and is under consideration in the House of Lords. The proposed legislation will be of interest to residents’ across this constituency as it will provide new powers to deal with Unauthorised Traveller Encampments.  Also contained within this legislation is the Government’s plan to create a new offence and an accompanying power for the police to seize property (including vehicles) to deal with the Unauthorised Encampments. The extent of the new law will make it an offence for a person to reside with a vehicle on land and fail to leave the land or remove their property without a reasonable excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it will help redress the balance, respecting the rights of the travelling community whilst also respecting the rights of residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing I would like to extend my continued thanks and appreciation to the members of Neighbourhood Watch for your continued commitment and work, in support of local residents and our local community, and in support of the work of our local Neighbourhood Police Teams.  Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendy&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Having chaired the Health and Care Bill in Parliament, convention requires that I shouldn&#8217;t vote at Report Stage. That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have real issues with what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson told us he had a plan to fix social care. Eventually he announced proposals to cover big shortfalls in funding by raising £12 billion through a national insurance increase.</p>



<p>Despite the tax grab, his plans weren&#8217;t discussed, weren&#8217;t even announced, during 21 committee sessions of the Health and Care Bill.</p>



<p>They were slipped out while sleaze and rail plans were dominating the news.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s doing a Robin Hood in reverse. Having repeatedly claimed no one would have to sell their home, it turns out that only the most expensive homes will be protected.</p>



<p>Many of England&#8217;s poorest pensioners will end up paying more for care and there are no plans to raise the quality, improve much needed home care services or address serious staff shortages.</p>



<p>Someone with a house valued at £70,000 will lose almost everything, while the owner of a property worth £1 million can safeguard 90%.</p>



<p>The biggest losers will be those in parts of the Midlands and the North of England where house prices are much lower than those in the South.</p>



<p>This social care con hits hardest in those seats the Tories gained from Labour at the last election, not surprising then that so many Tory MPs abstained on the vote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, research has revealed that one in four pensioners, forced to continue working to make ends meet, will not only be clobbered by the national insurance rise but also find themselves forced to sell their home when they need care.</p>



<p>Sir Andrew Dilnot, architect of the social care reforms which the Tories abandoned, told the Treasury Select Committee that the changes were &#8220;very disappointing&#8221; and warned that about 60% of people needing care will lose out.</p>



<p>Those with large assets will benefit but those with modest savings will see them eaten away.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a plan to fix social care, it&#8217;s a plan to rob the poor to help the rich.</p>

Panel 1 was made up of Dr Nick Hoggard, Lawyer, and Professor Penney Lewis, Commissioner at the Law Commission. The Law Commission is an independent statutory body responsible for conducting consultations, research and proposing reforms to the law for Parliament to consider, with the aim of ensuring offences remain up to date and effective. Dr Nick Hoggard was the Lead Lawyer and Project Manager for the Commission’s recently completed <a href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2020/09/Online-Communications-Consultation-Paper-FINAL-with-cover.pdf">review</a> of online offences. Professor Lewis oversees the Commission’s reviews, including those of online abuse and hate crime, (still ongoing). These reviews have recommended changes including the creation of a new harm based communications and the extension of some hate crime offences to a wider range of protected characteristics. Panel 2 included: Theo Bertram, Director of Government Relations and Public Policy for Europe at TikTok; Katy Minshall, Head of UK Public Policy at Twitter; Rebecca Stimson, UK Head of Public Policy at Meta.</p>
<p>The Petition Committee members asked members of Panel 1 about their proposed law reforms, overlapping and interacting with existing law, and Panel 2 members were asked about their platforms’ community standards, enforcement, anonymity, and the effect of the Draft Online Safety Bill on enforcement.</p>
<p>As part of my virtual visits to schools in Neath, this week I joined the wonderfully inquisitive pupils of Blaendulais Primary School and their inspirational teacher. The children asked me a wide variety of questions about my role as the MP for Neath, including: my work in Neath and Westminster; working in London Monday to Friday; being a vegan; animal welfare; COP26; climate emergency; air pollution; littering; active travel; and many more. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing from such knowledgeable children, who are our future.</p>
<p>As one of the events for White Ribbon Day – 25<sup>th</sup> November – I joined the Women’s PLP and heard from our guest speakers: Sophie Linden, Deputy Major for Policing and Crime in London; and Jess Phillips MP, Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding. Sophie told us about the Mayor’s Violence Against Women Strategy, which is currently out for public consultation, and how MPs can get involved in this process. She also outlined the work that the Metropolitan Police is doing to restore the trust and confidence of women in the police post Sarah Everard. Jess told us about her work highlighting that many more cases of domestic violence are reported, but far less are prosecuted.</p>
<p>White Ribbon Day was founded by a group of men in Canada in 1991 who felt they had to raise awareness of and work towards an end to violence against women. People wore white ribbons to oppose violence against women. The event spread through the world and the UK branch was established in 2004, and has grown every year since.</p>
<p>This year, for White Ribbon Day plus the 16 days that follow, people in communities, organisations and workplaces must come together to say “no” to violence against women. The leading message this year is #AllMenCan after the murder of Sarah Everard brought women’s experience of men’s violence to the forefront of everyone’s minds. The White Ribbon Promise is to never commit, excuse, or remain silent about male violence against women.</p>
<p>I have been campaigning on White Ribbon Day for many years, which has been led in Wales by Joyce Watson MS for Mid and West Wales since 2007.</p>
<p>I was pleased to visit the Welsh Air Ambulance drop in at Parliament this week and to lend my support for the fantastic work that they do. Our Air Ambulance in Wales is partly funded by the Welsh NHS and partly funded by charitable donations. As of a year ago, Wales has a 24/7 air ambulance operation to ensure critical pre-hospital care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, covering the whole of Wales, from its bases in Caernarfon, Llanelli, Cardiff and Welshpool. Its critical care consultants and practitioners are highly skilled and deliver blood transfusions, anaesthesia, and emergency operations, using some of the most pioneering medical equipment in the world. In order to maintain this vital lifeline, the Welsh Air Ambulance needs to raise £8 million every year. You can find out how you can donate or help raise funds on their <a href="https://www.walesairambulance.com/">website</a>.</p>
<p>This week the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Vegetarianism and Veganism, which I chair, has launched a report around dignity in care. The report was produced by V for Life and highlights failures in care because individual philosophical or religious beliefs around food and nutrition are neglected. The number of vegetarians, vegans, and flexitarians is growing all the time in the UK, with people becoming more knowledgeable about the impact of the food that they eat on their physical and mental health as well as the environment. The right to be fed according to religious or philosophical beliefs is enshrined in law, but in some care settings these beliefs are being ignored. We want to see change. You can read the full report <a href="http://vforlife.org.uk/files/VegAPPG_beliefs_respect_report.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I was delighted to support the cross-party campaign to pass the Downs Syndrome Bill into law. It is only right that everyone is entitled to the healthcare they need, and is given the education they require to fulfil their potential. The Bill is intended to ensure that provision is made to meet the needs of people with Downs Syndrome and that local authorities are obligated to assess the likely social care needs of those with Downs Syndrome. No one should be excluded from society because the means are not in place to allow them to enjoy what society has to offer, to allow them to contribute in employment; Downs Syndrome should not be a barrier to a full and happy life. This Private Members’ Bill has Government support, and therefore should make progress through the Parliamentary legislative process.</p>
<p>I was also delighted this week to join with so many Welsh Labour MPs in support of Kevin Brennan MP’s Fix Streaming Bill. Streaming is quickly replacing radio as our main means of accessing our favourite music and musicians. However, legal protections for artists have not kept pace with the technological advancements. Performers and songwriters are simply not paid fairly for their work when music is streamed – we forget that their product is their income. Record labels, streaming platforms, and other internet giants exploit musicians and artists without fair reward and it is time to put a stop to that and ensure that everyone is paid fairly for their work. We realised during the lockdowns how important the arts are to all of us, but we have to recognise that importance with fair remuneration now.</p>
<p>I was honoured to be elected co-chair of the All Part Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Agroecology with Ben Lake MP, joining the existing co-chair Lord Teverson at its AGM. We discussed the forward work programme for the next few months, which included amongst others, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, ELMS, the Land Use Strategy, Tenant Farmers, and the Food Strategy. I look forward to hearing from guest speakers from this wide spectrum of stakeholders representing the Agroecology sector.</p>
<p>On 7<sup>th</sup> October 2021, the APPG on State Pension Equality for Women, co-chaired by Andrew Gwynn MP and Peter Aldous MP, put out a call for representatives from 1950s women’s groups to get in touch to present evidence on the finding of the recent PHSO report, and any evidence deemed pertinent to the APPG. Many written individual testimonies were also sent to the APPG. We heard virtual oral evidence from representatives of 1950s women’s groups, managed on a rotating zoom room, in a closed session for Parliamentarians. The oral and written evidence will form part of the APPG’s submission to the Ombudsman’s stage 2 investigation.</p>
<p>As a member of the Panel of Chairs, I chaired the Delegated Legislation Committee which discussed the Draft Double Taxation Relief and International Tax Enforcement (Taiwan) Order 2021. This draft instrument would bring into effect arrangements set out in a Protocol made by the British Office Taipei and the Taipei Representative Office in the United Kingdom in 2021, and would amend the existing arrangements signed in 2002, between the two territories for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains. The purpose of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) is to prevent income or gains being taxed both in the territory in which they arise and in the territory in which the recipient resides. The committee members debated the draft instrument, and it was not opposed by opposition parties, so it was passed without a division.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to email christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152 – we are here to help.</p>

            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “Development has been worryingly dropped from the title of this important UK institution - but it is crucial that development and poverty eradication are not lost from its primary objectives.</p>
<p>"Labour has repeatedly called for the UK to use public investment to reduce poverty, create decent jobs and tackle global problems such as the climate crisis that affect us so much of this announcement is welcome.</p>
<p>“However, It is crucial that we are able to see the detail of the new strategy and scrutinise it properly at the earliest opportunity. It’s deeply disappointing therefore that Liz Truss has chosen to make this announcement to the media and not to Parliament.</p>
<p>“An expanded focus on climate change, green investment and infrastructure is welcome - and something Labour has pressed on for many years - not least given questions about the environmental sustainability of some of CDCs past and current investments. </p>
<p>“We must also not see an apparent shift in focus to the Indo-Pacific to come at the expense of huge needs in other areas - for example sub-Saharan Africa - and not least given the huge and growing influence of China in that continent. Coupled with the huge cuts to aid - we cannot afford to take our focus away when opportunities for mutual partnership and development are equally great, and fragility and crisis growing in key countries such as Ethiopia.</p>
<p>“The BII must also ensure that transparency and human rights are at the core of its investment criteria going forward.</p>
<p>“It is hugely welcome to see a woman with significant relevant experience taking the reins. I hope BII will put women and girls equally at the heart of its investment strategy. I wish Graham Wrigley all the best for the future and to thank him for his dedicated and service and dialogue over many years.”</p>

<p>At a meeting of Kendal Town Council's Environment and Highways Committee this week, Lib Dem Chair Eamonn Hennessy and Vice Chair Giles Archibald proposed to allocate £12,000 to fund an audit of local footpaths.</p>
<p>The committee have already earmarked £15,000 towards improving footpaths around Kirkbarrow.</p>
<p>The audit will look at the existing network of footpaths in Kendal, assess their current condition, find out who uses them, and what they use them for.</p>
<p>Lib Dem councillors will be surveying residents across the town in the coming weeks to find out which paths could do with being fixed and enhanced.</p>
<p>Eamonn said: <em>"From kids walking to school, to residents walking to shops in the town centre, our footpaths are so important to connecting Kendal.</em></p>
<p><em>"Sadly many of them are not fit for purpose, which is why we as Liberal Democrat councillors are launching this campaign to fund upgrades and improvements to local footpaths."</em></p>
<p>Giles said: <em>"We want to encourage active travel.</em></p>
<p><em>"We want to make it easier, safer and more attractive for people to walk around our town whether they are residents or visitors.</em></p>
<p><em>"We're proud of our town and want it to look the best it can."</em></p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP calls on the Prime Minister to act now before more lives are lost on our roads</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/11/25/karin-smyth-mp-calls-on-the-prime-minister-to-act-now-before-more-lives-are-lost-on-our-roads/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=karin-smyth-mp-calls-on-the-prime-minister-to-act-now-before-more-lives-are-lost-on-our-roads" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South and Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Towing and Trailer Safety, this week (Wednesday) called on the Prime Minister to fix the “chaotic mess” left behind by his Government following their ill-thought-out changes to trailer safety laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Government previously announced plans to scrap the need for drivers to pass a test to pull a trailer between 750kg and 3,500 kg (known as a B+E test).  However, due to last-minute confusion in the Department for Transport the law needed to implement this change was not passed.  This left the UK in a legal limbo where laws simultaneously did and did not apply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Government has reintroduced legislation, despite organisations including the Association of British Insurers and the Road Haulers Association condemning the changes, which they believe will have negative consequences for road safety. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speaking after she had taken Boris Johnson to task at Prime Minister’s Questions, Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South and Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Towing and Trailer Safety, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“The Government needs to sort out the chaotic mess it has created. That’s why I demanded the Prime Minister live up to his promises to improve trailer and road safety. Failure to do so will leave grieving families, who have worked tirelessly to improve road safety, bereft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“The Prime Minister trotted out the tired old lines that his reforms were to help alleviate the HGV driver shortage &amp;#8211; but this is simply not the case.  The Government won’t even undertake a risk assessment on their plans so cannot show the impact they will have. All we do know for certain is that 30% of drivers who took the previous test failed and they will now be released back onto our roads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I’ve worked closely with ministers in the Department for Transport on this issue for more than half a decade. They know, as does everyone else, that these changes will  set us back nearly 20 years on road safety. The Prime Minister must take action to stop this from happening”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The post &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/11/25/karin-smyth-mp-calls-on-the-prime-minister-to-act-now-before-more-lives-are-lost-on-our-roads/"&gt;Karin Smyth MP calls on the Prime Minister to act now before more lives are lost on our roads&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com"&gt;Karin Smyth&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

&lt;p&gt;MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar Angus MacNeil is to meet with the Hebridean Housing Partnership (HHP) in the coming weeks regarding concerns over housing on the islands.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Mr MacNeil said: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At the recent Western Isles Fishermen’s AGM concerns were raised about the lack of housing in Leverburgh. Following that meeting I wrote to HHP raising the need for greater accessibility to housing in Leverburgh and in other areas and was delighted to learn from HHP that they are indeed conducting a feasibility study in Leverburgh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HHP tell me that they are currently researching and will reporting on the housing needs in Leverburgh with a view to building. I hope that they do go ahead and build in Leverburgh but I understand that they have to go through their procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is right that HHP do their processes of diligence, but it is also right that voices in the community that probably instinctively know what is required, are given due weight as well. I am amplifying these voices and calling for houses to be built in Leverburgh to meet the needs of the community, businesses and all.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I will not doff my hat to the PM for short-changing the North yet again</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My latest editorial for the Telegraph &amp;amp; Argus, appearing in Wednesday 17th November&amp;#8217;s edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just over a week ago, I attended the House of Commons to ask the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees Mogg MP, to grant a debate with a focus on funding and access to NHS dentistry. However, before I could ask this, the Leader of the House dropped the bombshell that the Prime Minister was to make a U-turn on his plans for a Tory-dominated committee to rewrite the House of Commons&amp;nbsp;rules on standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only the day before, I witnessed Government whips corralling Tory MPs through the voting lobbies to prevent a former Conservative Minister from being suspended from Parliament for lobbying on behalf of two firms he was working for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the words of John Major, former Conservative Prime Minister, “I think the way the government handled that was shameful, wrong and unworthy of this or indeed any government. It also had the effect of trashing the reputation of parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout this parliament, I have seen first-hand how this government has put the political considerations of their MPs and friends above the needs of the general population, non-more so than throughout their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Tories may want us to think that Tory sleaze is old news, it’s clearly still alive and kicking for us all to see. It’s disappointing to see the government of the day treating my constituents in Bradford South, and others across the country, with such contempt. Seemingly, it’s one rule for them and their mates and another for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, I was also disappointed by the government’s response to questions raised in my speech on the Budget. I again asked the Chancellor about his plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) and connectivity to and across the North. I have raised this question many times in Westminster and elsewhere, maybe as many times as the government&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;made announcements on it, but it would be hard going to match their record as they have made at least 60 but with extraordinarily little substance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the avalanche of leaks from the Treasury, I was hoping to hear some positive messages on NPR but sadly nothing was forthcoming. I then hoped the Chancellor would pull something out of the hat on Budget Day. He did no such thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know if the government had some positive news on NPR for Bradford, it would not be keeping it a secret. I am now hearing that the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) is likely to be published tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The integrated rail plan was supposed to be about presenting a blueprint of how Northern Powerhouse Rail, HS2 and Trans-Pennine upgrades &amp;#8211; three separate but integrated schemes &amp;#8211; would be delivered in parallel. &amp;nbsp;Delivered in full, this could have provided up to 150,000 new jobs, halved journey times from Bradford to Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and York, and boosted Bradford’s economy by £30 billion over ten years. Instead, it looks like we will get a failure to deliver NPR, a watered-down HS2 and money to deliver Trans-Pennine route upgrades that are needed anyway. &amp;nbsp;This diluted version will not deliver the transformational change the North needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lots of people right across the north voted Conservative for the first time at the last election, believing promises about levelling-up and investment in the North. Delivering NPR was one of the first things Mr Johnson promised on becoming PM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I, for one, will not be doffing my cap and thanking him for short-changing Bradford and the North again – nor would my constituents forgive me if I took this easy course of action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returning to the rest of the Budget, alongside the Chancellor’s failure to promote economic growth in the North, he also failed to&lt;/strong&gt; tackle the growing cost of living crisis and continued to place a massive tax burden on working people and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it was an out-of-touch, high tax, low growth budget from an out-of-touch chancellor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a brighter note, the Menopause Bill, which I have been working on, moved another step closer to being enacted this month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, it costs women hundreds of pounds every year to access hormone replacement therapy. This legislation&amp;nbsp;will see these costs drastically reduced and as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on osteoporosis and bone health, this is something I wholeheartedly support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women need to be properly supported around the time of menopause and this includes assessing their risk of osteoporosis and fractures, being given appropriate advice and any medication and treatment that they may need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am proud to both break the silence on the silent disease of osteoporosis and to break the taboo on talking about menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deputy Leader sets out aspirations for COP26 ahead of visit to Glasgow</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/11/10/deputy-leader-sets-out-aspirations-for-cop26-ahead-of-visit-to-glasgow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;At full council yesterday
afternoon, Cllr Longford was asked what she would like to see from COP26 this
week and what progress Nottingham has made on its carbon neutral ambition. The
question came from Mike Edwards, Councillor for the Meadows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response Cllr Sally
Longford said “I think we would all agree that the desired outcome for COP
would be that agreement is reached to work together internationally to, secure
global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach. But we also
need to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats, and to mobilise
finance, particularly for communities at the greatest threat from the effects
of climate change.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cllr Sally Longford will be attending COP26 this week as part of the Core
Cities delegation, to showcase Nottingham’s response to the climate emergency
and learn from cities around the world about what more we can do. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr
Longford also updated Full Council on significant progress in Nottingham toward
its 2028 carbon neutral goal:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;City CO2
emissions have reduced by 53% per capita since 2005, the most of any UK core
city and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;45% of the
Council fleet is now ULEV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First in world to
use purpose built electric bin wagons and over &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14,500 trees have
been planted since 2019 with 50,000 by 2023. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;130 public EV
charging points, with an additional &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;81 recently
installed at new Broadmarsh Car Park.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since 2012, over
7,000 social and private hard-to-heat homes have been insulated and over 4,000
social housing properties now have solar panels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However I am far from
complacent, there is much to do and we cannot do this on our own.” insisted
Cllr Sally Longford.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“We need Government, private investment and other stakeholders to support our
vital work. We have already had demonstrator projects in the city, but they
need to be scaled up, creating jobs and achieving a just transition to a low
carbon economy, where our more deprived communities can benefit from warmer
homes, affordable energy and access to clean modes of transport.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday worldwide
marches took place to demand international action on climate change. Cllr
Longford attended, and spoke at, the event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was honoured to be given
the opportunity to lead the march alongside Lilian Greenwood, with a diverse
group of people, on Saturday to stand up for Climate Justice and to speak at
the rally in the Old Market Square.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councillor Longford wrapped
up her answer by stating “We need the Government to take action, and truly
commit to a net zero-carbon future.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

    <title>Matt Warman MP urges residents in Boston &amp; Skegness to protect themselves as the UK reaches historic milestone of 10 million booster jabs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2021/11/08/matt-warman-mp-urges-residents-in-boston-skegness-to-protect-themselves-as-the-uk-reaches-historic-milestone-of-10-million-booster-jabs/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>More than 10 million people across the UK – including 1,552,387 across the Midlands – have now received a COVID-19 booster or third jab to protect themselves and their loved ones this winter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Matt Warman is calling for vulnerable people in Boston &amp; Skegness who have not yet come forward to do so as soon as possible to help build our wall of defence and keep people safe over the winter months.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is making it easier than ever to get topped-up by allowing people to book their appointments five months after their second dose from Monday and making booster jabs available at walk-in centres without appointments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that 1,552,387 people in the Midlands have received their COVID-19 booster or third jab as the Conservative government continues to step up efforts to ensure that vulnerable people are fully protected against COVID-19 over the winter.</p>
<p>The latest figures show that more than 10 million people across the UK have received their COVID-19 booster or third jabs, ensuring the vital protection they have secured from their first two doses is maintained over the winter months.</p>
<p>A total of 10,062,704 people have received their booster and third jabs in the UK. 45,836,791 people have had two doses (79.7%) and 50,234,416 people have received one dose (87.4%).</p>
<p>Seven in 10 over 80s and three in five over-50s in England are already vaccinated with top-up jabs.</p>
<p>NHS England will be inviting another three million people who will become eligible for their booster next week. More than 13 million invites, including texts, letters and emails, have already been sent to eligible people in England so far asking them to book their booster online through the National Booking Service. The additional letters due to land next week will mean around 16 million invites have been sent in England since the NHS booster programme began.</p>
<p>The National Booking Service will be updated tomorrow (Monday 8 November) to allow those eligible for a booster vaccine – people over 50 and those most at risk of COVID-19 – to pre-book their jab five months after their second dose.</p>
<p>People will still receive their vaccine six months after their second dose, but the change will speed up the vaccination programme by allowing people to receive a jab the day they become eligible, rather than waiting for a convenient appointment.</p>
<p>People will also be able to book by calling 119 and can get vaccinated at hundreds of walk-in sites across the country six months after their second dose without an appointment. Those eligible can use the NHS online walk-in finder to locate the most convenient site.</p>
<p>COVID-19 booster vaccines have been delivered or booked in at every older adult care home in England where safe to do so, with almost nine in 10 care homes already visited.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolutely fantastic news that 1,552,387 people across the Midlands have received a booster dose or third vaccination, which will offer life-saving protection to them and their loved ones this winter.</p>
<p>“Those people, including everyone who has got their third jab in Boston &amp; Skegness, are part of the ten million people across the country who have already received a booster jab. I would urge anyone who is eligible and hasn’t yet come forward to get a booster jab as soon as possible, by booking online or at one of our local walk-in sites.</p>
<p>We can all do our bit this winter to protect our loved ones and the NHS, and to stay ahead in the race against the virus, by taking up the offer of a vaccine as soon as we are eligible.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“More than 10 million people across the UK now have the vital protection boosters provide, building our wall of defence and keeping people safe over the winter months. We know immunity begins to wane after six months, particularly for the elderly and at-risk groups, and booster jabs will ensure our most vulnerable are protected over the winter.</p>
<p>“It’s never been easier to get your top-up jabs now that those eligible can book in advance or visit hundreds of walk-in sites across the country.</p>
<p>“Please do not delay – get your vaccines as soon as you can to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter so we can keep the virus at bay.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes to Editors:</strong></p>
<p>The Conservative government is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling out the fastest vaccine programme in Europe, allowing us to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms.</strong> Almost nine in ten people aged 12 and over have now received a first vaccine dose – with almost eight in ten having also received a second dose. The latest data shows that vaccines have saved almost 130,000 deaths and prevented almost 250,000 hospitalisations. <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/"> Public Health England, Coronavirus Dashboard, accessed 21October 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Securing two new ground-breaking Covid antiviral drugs, preventing the spread of the virus and bolstering our defence for the winter months ahead.</strong> We have secured 730,000 doses of two new ground-breaking antiviral drugs – which will help to prevent the infection from spreading and speed up recovery times for people. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-secures-groundbreaking-covid-19-antivirals">DHSC, Press Release, 20 October 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Securing a portfolio of 517 million doses of the eight most promising vaccines through our Vaccine Taskforce for the whole of the Union.</strong> We have secured a portfolio of 517 million doses of the most promising vaccines, including over 210 million doses of the Oxford-Astrazenca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines being administered across the UK, as well as 20 million doses of the Janssen vaccine which be rolled out later this year. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/janssen-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-by-uk-medicines-regulator">DHSC, Press Release, 28 May 2021</a>; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-thirds-of-uk-adults-receive-first-dose-of-a-covid-19-vaccine">DHSC, Press Release, 7 May 2021</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting the NHS on a sustainable financial footing, so it is there for future generations.</strong> We will deliver around £12 billion a year in extra funding for our frontline health and social care across the UK over the next three years – a total of £36 billion. This is in addition to our historic settlement for the NHS in 2018, which will see its budget rise by £33.9 billion a year by 2023-24. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015736/Build_Back_Better-_Our_Plan_for_Health_and_Social_Care.pdf">Prime Minister’s Office, Build Back Better: Our Plan for Health and Social Care, 7 September 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Delivering the biggest catch-up programme in the NHS’s history, so that everyone can get the care they deserve.</strong> Over the next three years, will deliver the equivalent of around nine million more checks, scans and procedures – and elective activity will be around 30 per cent than it was before the pandemic. Once the NHS has recovered from the pandemic, activity should be ten per cent higher than under the NHS Long Term Plan. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015736/Build_Back_Better-_Our_Plan_for_Health_and_Social_Care.pdf">Prime Minister’s Office, Build Back Better: Our Plan for Health and Social Care, 7 September 2021</a></li>

    <title>Oldham MP speaks out about NHS reorganisation plans</title>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>I have spoken out against the Government’s plans to pass a new bill to reorganise the NHS in England.</p>
<p>As a long-time campaigner against NHS privatisation, previously resigning as Chair of Rochdale Primary Care Trust over concerns of the increase in use of private healthcare companies in the NHS, I am speaking out this time against the Government’s Health and Care Bill.</p>
<p>The action comes as a new poll by We Own It, the campaign for public ownership of public services, shows that 8 in 10 people want the Government to fix waiting lists and ensure that people can see their GPs face-to-face as their top priority, compared to just 2 in 10 who said reorganising the NHS should be a top priority.</p>
<p>The Bill, which had its second reading in the House of Commons on 14 July, is expected to enter the next stage of its passage on 9 November. The Bill will divide the NHS in England into 42 areas, called Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), each with its own budget and a board to oversee the delivery of health services for the area.</p>
<p>This is the wrong bill at the wrong time.</p>
<p>To introduce a bill like this when the Covid pandemic is far from over, and staff are on their knees, shows a lack of understanding of what’s needed. I’m also concerned that this re-organisation of the NHS is being used as an opportunity to extend the involvement of UK and international private healthcare companies.</p>
<p>The bill is proposing that private healthcare companies can become members of integrated care boards (ICBs) potentially procuring health services from their own companies, and this is entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Campaigners and trade unionists say the Bill will allow private companies to sit on the boards that oversee the new ICSs and make decisions about how the budget is spent. They also claim that by repealing Section 75 of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which required that all contracts be put through a competitive tendering process, the Bill will open the NHS to more crony contracts.</p>
<p>The new poll also shows that 70% of the public, including 70% of Conservative voters and 82% of Labour voters, say they are worried that the Bill would open the NHS to contracts being given out to private companies without scrutiny. 60% of those polled say they want the Bill to be amended to make NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts the default providers of all NHS services.</p>
<p>The Westminster protest was joined by more than 35 Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and SNP Members of Parliament. Organisers say further local actions are planned to take place in more than 100 constituencies, with local people dropping off letters to their MP’s offices asking them to oppose the Health and Care bill.</p>
<p>The protest was organised by We Own It and Just Treatment, a patient-led group that represents the voice of patients. It was also supported by Unite the Union, the British Medical Association, the National Pensioners Convention, and more.</p>
<p>Johnbosco Nwogbo, Campaigns Lead for We Own It, one of the key organisations involved in the action said: “This Bill will put on steroids the government’s unlawful contracting we’ve seen during the pandemic. With the Secretary of State for Health set to receive increased powers in this bill, Sajid Javid will be enabled to simply hand out contracts to party donors and friends without any kind of scrutiny”.</p>
<p>He added, “It’s clear that a lot of MPs are really worried about how this bill will change our NHS and open it to being used as a profit-making venture for profit-greedy private companies within it. We just hope more of them, including Conservatives, will speak out.”</p>
<p>Hope Worsdale, Digital Comms and Campaign Lead from Just Treatment, said: “All the patients we work with are deeply worried about the future of our NHS, so this week we took the fight against this dangerous Bill to right outside Parliament, and it was fantastic to be joined by so many MPs. This parliamentary support shows that our campaigning is working, and that we have people in the House of Commons willing to fight for the future of our NHS. We know that the government’s plans will fail patients across the country – so now we need even more people to get involved in ramping up the pressure on their MPs to reject the bill.”</p>

    <title>Emma Leads a Debate on Sewage Pollution in Whitburn</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-leads-a-debate-on-sewage-pollution-in-whitburn/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>



<p>You can read my full speech <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-10-27/debates/2FE67ECE-5C5C-4910-876B-9610627E645A/SewagePollutionWhitburn">here.</a></p>

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-37/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Covid and other local issues. If you are receiving one of these emails for the first time, it is because you have contacted me recently. I have been sending these updates throughout the pandemic to help provide information to people about what is going on locally. If you do not want to be included in further updates about the pandemic and other issues, please use the unsubscribe button at the bottom of this message.</p>
<h3><strong>Booster dose of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine</strong></h3>
<p>A number of people have contacted me to say that they have been unable to organise booster jabs when they thought they should be receiving them. I have checked this and the trigger point for eligibility comes six months and one week after the second vaccine jab earlier in the year. So anyone who had their jab on May 1st would be able to get their jab from next week.</p>
<p>If you are eligible but have not yet received an invitation to book from the NHS, please use <a href="https://news.chrisgrayling-mp.org.uk/4F6F6E5283BF934361A94E3CEA6B1685D0D29CAE573DBB1E3486A2A25B4F9FB9/5D97560853D6236792D3116494E87D84/LE35"><strong>this link</strong></a> to do so.</p>
<h3><strong>Face-to-face GP appointments</strong></h3>
<p>Many people have also contacted me about the availability of face to face appointments with local GPs. I know that this has been a frustration for many people. But I should also say that both GPs and the NHS have been under enormous pressure in recent months and the level of demand for appointments of all sorts has been very high indeed.</p>
<p>For many people a virtual appointment is a much easier way to deal with a GP. But I have spoken to the leadership of the NHS in Surrey and they have told me that anyone who needs a face to face appointment should be able to get one.</p>
<h3><strong>Train services to London</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you who are commuters, I am stepping up pressure on the train companies and the Department for Transport to get back to a much closer to normal timetable. The Tattenham Corner direct trains have now been restored, and I have been promised that there will be a regular through service from Ashtead and Epsom to London Bridge in the peak by next May at the latest, though I am pushing for this to be earlier.</p>
<p>There remains a serious issue around the SWR services to Waterloo and I have asked for a further meeting with the company about what is happening. If you find yourself on a train which is very overcrowded and people are struggling to get on as it gets closer to central London, it would be very helpful if you could let me know.</p>
<h3><strong>The Chalk Pit Site Epsom</strong></h3>
<p>The controversial planning application for the Chalk Pit in Epsom is due to be heard by the County Council on the 17th November. I have also met the Secretary of State to discuss the performance of the Environment Agency on the issue, and there is now an investigation taking place to see whether they have taken sufficient action on the blight to local residents.</p>
<p>I will continue to do what I can to get the issue resolved.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooding issues in Nork &amp; Tattenhams</strong></h3>
<p>Last Thursday I was at a meeting with councillors and local residents in Nork and Tattenhams and Surrey County Council about the flooding issue in the area. If you were not able to be there and your home is affected by the problem, please do<strong> <a href="mailto:chris.grayling.mp@parliament.uk">get in touch</a> </strong>and I will update you about the potential ways forward that were discussed.Future Mole Valley Local Plan</p>
<h3><strong>Mole Valley Local Plan</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you in Ashtead, the deadline to comment on the Mole Valley local plan is this coming weekend. I know that many people are very concerned about the scale of what is proposed by the Council for the area around Ashtead. If you want to comment, the link is <a href="https://news.chrisgrayling-mp.org.uk/87667194E53429415FEB1B971292AA929B66B9C20B22D6D0E3A2D094918BEBA1/5D97560853D6236792D3116494E87D84/LE35"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you have any particular issues that you need to raise, please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Government is all about making choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;In his budget, the UK Chancellor had the opportunity to do the decent thing for millions of people affected by the combination of rising costs and income that fails to match it. He chose not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that inflation and higher taxes would dwarf any small increases for middle-wage earners and that low-income households will feel &amp;#8220;real pain&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;They pointed out that families struggling on Universal Credit must endure a £20 per week and that the Chancellor&amp;#8217;s adjustments won&amp;#8217;t make up for that cut, even before national insurance rises come in the Spring. Another organisation, initially set up by the UK Government to monitor spending, said that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years. Inflation is set to soar over 4% &amp;#8211; that has a massive effect on the ability of households to meet their living costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Here in the Highlands, we have the extra challenges of having higher transport costs and higher costs for energy and fuel.  In households across our communities, people no longer have to choose between food and heat – because thanks to this Chancellor and this UK Government,  they cannot afford to buy either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;In the spending review, the Chancellor chose not to invest in children who have the most difficult starts in life. He chose not to invest in sorting the mess created by Brexit – felt in every household in Scotland and across the nations of the UK. Instead, he chose to give a tax cut to his old pals in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;It seems there is no money to invest in tackling the fact that the UK has the worst poverty levels in western Europe. Still, there was money for encouraging more short-haul air travel &amp;#8211; on the eve of the COP 26 Climate conference. There is also money for cutting tax on ships that will fly the British flag and multinational companies, like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;And, whilst any money for our region is welcome, let&amp;#8217;s not fall for the small pockets of money earmarked for Highland projects. The money offered up is nothing compared to the EU money lost to the region, and it does not even come close to the £83 million still missing from the City Region Deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;A Tory Chancellor at Westminster made his choices. Like every other Tory budget or spending review that came before – he made them for ideological reasons. To them, if anyone is poor, that&amp;#8217;s their hard luck – they just have to try harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;The fact is, those who are the poorest today have spent most of their lives governed by people who have no concept about what it is like to live without privilege. There is always money for contracts for pals, never for hard-pressed families. History shows us that the choices Westminster makes for us are never going to change. We need different choices to be made, to see fairness, justice, and hope for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;Scotland will thrive without Westminster, but how long can we survive being shackled to it?&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my October email newsletter. It has been a busy but sombre month in parliament, as the Spending Review has been&nbsp;published in full and we celebrate the life, and mourn the death, of James Brokenshire MP and Sir David Amess MP.</p>



<p>Below you’ll find updates on the Budget, local Covid-19 case rates, a new charity in Langley Mill, more support for local pubs, an explanation on proposed&nbsp;amendments to the Environment Bill, and my view on a mayor for the East Midlands.</p>



<p><strong><u>Autumn Budget &amp; Spending Review</u></strong></p>



<p>On Wednesday 27th October, the Chancellor released the Autumn Budget and Spending Review, revealing the Government’s plans for spending, taxes, and borrowing. Prior to its release, I expected to see some pretty alarming public finances as a result of the pandemic, and to be fair, we have seen some difficult&nbsp;numbers. The deficits for the last financial year and the current year total £500 billion, and we will still be running a deficit this year of about £130 billion.</p>



<p>However, despite the storm of the pandemic crashing over our economy, it is forecasted that the books will be completely balanced in the financial year after next. I could not possibly have expected that we could go from the economic tempest that was the pandemic, back to balanced public finances in less than a couple of years. This is a tremendous achievement. That we can even forecast that position demonstrates how successful the Government’s measures to save the economy have been over the past 18 months.</p>



<p>The success of these forecasts depends largely upon the growth of our economy. At the minute, the UK economy is growing faster than our major international competitors, more people are in work, and growth is up. However, uncertainty in the global economy means that this rate of recovery is not guaranteed. Therefore, we need to focus on what more we can do to increase the long-term trend in the rate of growth. That is why we need to make sure that the very welcome measures to increase investment, improve skills, and boost productivity are driven through and made to work.</p>



<p>Policies of particular interest to the residents of Amber Valley include:</p>



<p>. More money for local NHS services and schools;</p>



<p>. Increasing the National Living Wage by 6.6% to £9.50;&nbsp;</p>



<p>. The end of the public sector pay freeze;</p>



<p>. A 5% cut to pub beer duty through a new Draught Relief, simplifying wider alcohol duties and freezing fuel duty;</p>



<p>. Cutting business rates by at least 50% next year for 90% of retail, hospitality and leisure businesses;&nbsp;</p>



<p>. A reduction in the universal credit taper from the current 63p to 55p &#8211; allowing claimants who are in work to keep more of their benefits, ensuring that being in work pays more.</p>



<p>Speaking in the House of Commons on 27th October, I wholeheartedly welcomed the Autumn Budget and Spending Review. I believe it to be a hugely powerful budget that sets our country and economy in the right direction. It shows a welcome improvement in the public finances and delivers on many of the priorities of Amber Valley residents.</p>



<p>You can find the Chancellor&#8217;s statement in full <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents">here</a>, and my speech in the House following it <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-27a.288.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g340.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Covid-19 and Vaccination Update</u></strong></p>



<p>558 Positive cases have been confirmed in Amber Valley over the last 7 days, that’s 433 cases per 100,000 people. This remains below the national average for England, which currently stands at 484 cases per 100,000 people.o</p>



<p>The number of people testing positive for coronavirus in Amber Valley has been fluctuating since restrictions in England were lifted on 19<sup>th</sup> July, and as predicted, case rates began to increase considerably as we moved through autumn into the colder months. This led to some of the highest case rates we have seen in our constituency, with 157 people testing positive on the 4<sup>th</sup> October. However, despite some projections that case rates would continue to rise, they have actually been falling consistently throughout this month, so that the 7 day average for positive cases currently sits at 79.</p>



<p>Compared to last winter, hospitalisations relating to coronavirus continue to remain well below what we would expect, given the relatively high prevalence of the virus in the community. It is clear for the time being, that while health services in Amber Valley remain under some strain, owing in no small part to the unprecedented backlog in treatments, the risk of it being overwhelmed remains low. It is for this reason, therefore, that I do not support the introduction of so-called “plan-b” coronavirus restrictions at this time.</p>



<p>Our first line of defence against this virus continues to be our exemplary vaccination rollout, a terrific local and national effort. With everyone over the age of 50 being offered a booster jab, I urge anyone who is eligible to come forward and get jabbed. To protect themselves, our community, and our local health services.</p>



<p>As with the first doses of the vaccine, when you are eligible you should be notified by text, letter, or by your GP to arrange a booking. However, if you think you are eligible but have not been notified you can book the booster by calling 119 or online via the NHS website: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/book-or-manage-a-booster-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/book-or-manage-a-booster-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/</a></p>



<p><strong><u>Breast Milk Hub opening &#8211; Langley Mill</u></strong></p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was honoured to open Lauren’s Milk Hub in Langley Mill. This new Hub will help provide donor human breast milk that can then be transported to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) at hospitals across the East Midlands. It is an excellent addition to our local health networks as it will allow more sick and premature babies in the region to receive safe, screened donor milk.</p>



<p><strong><u>Support for Local Pubs</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 20<sup>th</sup> October I met with Emma McClarkin, Head of the British Beer and Pub Association, to sign a petition calling on the Government to lower draught beer duty ahead of the autumn budget. I am delighted that upon release of the budget, the Chancellor announced that tax on draught beer and cider will indeed be cut by 5%. The duty cut will bring down the cost of a pint by 3p, or as much as 25p for beer below 3.5% ABV.</p>



<p>The local pub is at the heart of many of our communities in Amber Valley, and is vital for creating jobs, boosting the local economy, and combatting loneliness and social isolation. In our constituency alone, pubs support 1,103 jobs and contribute £25m per year to the local economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an especially difficult time for pubs, and local owners and staff have made clear to me how precarious the past 2 years have been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, I am very pleased that the Government has continued to demonstrate its firm commitment to this most vital industry. With the lower duty on draught beer set to help our locals in Amber Valley thrive.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have recently been in contact with me to raise concerns about access to GP appointments following the pandemic. I&#8217;m very grateful for the work of our GPs, and all our NHS, throughout Covid-19 and always, and so I raised this issue in the House with the Secretary of State during Health &amp; Social Care Questions to see how we can support both GPs and constituents. I welcome the recent announcement of a £250 million winter access fund for GPs as a positive step, and I will continue to follow this closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read the full debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-19c.585.3&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g586.2">here</a>&nbsp;and the full GP plan <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/10/plan-set-out-to-improve-access-for-nhs-patients-and-support-gps/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Investment in the East Midlands</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament on the 26<sup>th</sup> of this month, I urged the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, to make progress on devolution and additional investment in the&nbsp;East Midlands. Our region has looked with some deserved envy at neighbouring regions that have elected mayors and have successfully attracted more investment.</p>



<p>It is my firm belief that the East Midlands would benefit greatly from an elected mayor to represent the region on the national stage. However, in the meantime I also reminded the Secretary of State that Derbyshire stands ready for a county deal of investment and would appreciate being a pathfinder for this scheme. You can see my question and the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-25a.8.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g8.1">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a chilly constituency Friday for Mr Shapps, as he was invited to tour the 235,000 square foot refrigerated distribution facility, which sees 520 million litres of fresh milk pass through it each year.</p>
<p>Opened in 2013, the facility operates 24/7, 364 days a year, delivering brands such as Cravendale to stores around the country, to retailers like Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s. The centre employs a team of 500 people, 60% of which are Welwyn Hatfield residents.</p>
<p>Prior to the tour of the distribution centre, Mr Shapps sat down with Ash Amirahmadi- Managing Director of Arla Foods UK- and other members of the local team to discuss the challenges and pressures facing the company, and food distribution more widely, during the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>At the centre of discussions was the HGV driver shortage. At Arla, HGV salaries have been going up to meet demand for drivers- with annual salaries of £50,000-£70,000 depending on shift pattern.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of Arla Foods said: “We were delighted to welcome Grant Shapps to Arla Hatfield. We had a very constructive and positive discussion about our cooperative and the wider dairy sector with him, both as our local MP and as the Transport Secretary. We look forward to continuing to work closely together in the future.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s been really great to come to Arla, and hear first hand how businesses with a presence in my own constituency have been reacting to the international HGV driver shortage, as well as how the company has adapted to doing business post-covid.</p>
<p>“I commend Arla for their commitment to improving pay and conditions for HGV drivers. Increases in pay, starting a driving academy to train new drivers, as well as a programme to rehabilitate former prisoners to drive lorries and improvements to their facilities- all of these things will help make driving an HGV a more attractive career choice for those looking to get into the industry. Our plan seems to be working, with 1,000 provisional HGV licenses being applied for each day- that’s 3 times higher than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As Transport Secretary, I’ve put together a list of 25 separate measures to help ease the pressure on businesses like Arla- including increasing driving test capacity at the DVSA to clear the covid backlog, making those tests faster by stream-lining them and getting the army in to take on some of the strain in the short-term.</p>
<p>“These measures, combined with the hard work of the food distributors I’ve met today, will keep our supplies stocked as the global economy gets back up and running.”</p></div>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
