    <title>Fact checking the BBC</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/08/17/fact-checking-the-bbc/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was surprised to receive an email from the BBC after my interview on Monday of last week. It asked me to prove that German carbon dioxide emissions were twice as large as the UK’s,  a claim I made in  my interview. I was surprised because I would expect the BBC to know the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide as practically every BBC news show and comment show has to have a climate change item on it these days. I sent him back  couple of sources that a simple google search  yielded. I had of course checked my recollections of the numbers before doing the interview so I knew they were correct. He expressed no interest in my allegations about China which accounts for around 27 times as much CO2 output as the UK.</p>
<p>He returned to the issue having consulted someone else to point out that if you looked at consumption patterns rather than at where fuel was burned and  things made the Uk would have a worse figure and Germany as  a leading exporter of carbon dioxide drenched products would have a bit better figure by transferring some of their CO2 to the importing country. Germany would of course still be the larger emitter.  I explained that I was talking about COP 26 and the global Treaty framework. The whole basis of the international conferences is to get countries to pledge to cut the CO2 that is generated on their territory, as that is more subject to their control. Surely  the expression Germany’s CO2 output means just that, the CO2 they produce.</p>
<p>He agreed that the figures used were correct but felt he needed to write an additional essay about how perhaps we should use consumption based figures instead of the agreed international output based figures. I objected to this being done in  the name of a fact check on what I had said when it was obvious I had cited accurate normal figures. Nonetheless the BBC fact check then posted a long essay which did begin by quoting another source to show my figures were accurate before going  into a long apology for Germany and a representation of figures to cast Germany in a  better light. Why? Why does Germany have to be protected when her business model includes digging out plenty of brown coal and burning it, and producing millions of fossil fuel burning vehicles. In contrast the UK has all but phased out coal from the mix. Why no mention of Germany’s rows over extending open cast coal mining, her refusal to eliminate coal  this decade, and no mention of China, the world’s largest carbon dioxide producer?</p>

<p><span><span><span>That’s why I have helped raise with DEFRA the response from Anglian Water to the Secretary of State’s statement on reducing water consumption – in which they outline further measures they would like to see implemented so as to reduce the need to extract water from our natural environment, and highlight some of the steps they personally are taking to ensure they remain at the top of their field in this matter.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Despite the increasing flooding issues we have seen in our part of the world, water is not as abundant a resource as we might perceive – with the East of England the driest area of the country.

              <p class="MsoNormal">Earlier in the year Jon Cruddas MP and the Labour team in Rainham raised concerns about the poor state of repair of Upminster Road North. The local MP had been contacted by residents in the northern part of the ward who all expressed that the road was now becoming dangerous for drivers due to potholes and other damage to the carriageway.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After mounting pressure, Havering Council have now responded to the Dagenham and Rainham MP to confirm that the whole of Upminster Road North will be resurfaced in September (next month).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon said:</strong> <em>“The roads and pavements across Rainham have long been on our agenda but Havering Council have failed to act in the past. The state of the road was in rapid decline, so this is a very welcome announcement. </em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>“The local Labour Action Team are working hard to hold the council to account over the lack of support for basic infrastructure in the south of the borough. So, we are hoping that this is the first of many improvements for Rainham.”</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Simon Darvill from the Rainham Labour Action Team said;</strong> <em>“We spoke with lots of people in the area and the state of Upminster Road North was raised consistently. Jon has delivered a great result for local people. This is the sort of thing ward councillors should be picking up but if they won’t fight for investment in the ward it falls on Labour to step in.”</em></p>

<p>This article was written by David Lynch and originally published on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/business/former-minister-backs-calls-to-halt-long-decline-of-british-manufacturing-b1902144.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a> website.</p>



<p>John Penrose has given his support to a 10-point plan which aims to increase the value of manufacturing to 15% of GDP by 2025.</p>



<p>A former&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/government">Government</a>&nbsp;minister has backed a plan which aims to reverse the “long, slow decline of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/british">British</a>&nbsp;manufacturing”.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/john-penrose">John Penrose</a>&nbsp;gave his backing to the 10-point plan from a cross-party think tank, which has also warned that the UK faces a decade of decline if it fails to increase manufacturing’s value to 15% of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gdp">GDP</a>&nbsp;by 2025.</p>



<p>The Institute for Prosperity said manufacturing and reindustrialisation is “key” to boosting the economy and to the Government’s “levelling up” agenda.</p>



<p>Weston-Super-Mare Conservative MP Mr Penrose said: “The long, slow decline of British manufacturing has deep roots, so reversing it will need big, structural changes to our education system, our economy and our society.</p>



<p>“We’re already making progress in areas like building new infrastructure, improving technical education and turbocharging capital investment, but there’s still a long way to go. So perhaps the recommendation that matters most is the last one – be more ambitious.”</p>



<p>According to the think tank, UK manufacturing has declined to less than 10% of GDP over the last 40 years, “eroded by a lack of support and rapid deindustrialisation”.</p>



<p>This compares with about 20% of GDP in countries such as Germany and South Korea.</p>



<p>The institute, founded by Labour Party donor John Mills, set out 10 ways to increase manufacturing’s contribution to the national income.</p>



<p>This includes a call to “rebalance the economy” by increasing manufacturing to 15% of GDP.</p>



<p>The think tank called for more funding for technical training, rewards for capital expenditure, the establishment of a national investment bank, and prioritising infrastructure investments with the “highest social payback”.</p>



<p>It also recommends creating a Green Investment Allowance to reduce energy costs, overhauling planning rules for industrial activities, increased investment in research and development, using tax incentives to encourage companies to stay in the UK, and to set ambitious targets to make “Britain the easiest place to set up a manufacturing business”.</p>



<p>Former business secretary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vince-cable">Vince Cable</a>&nbsp;who also backs the 10-point plan, said: “At a time when the Government seems to be going cold on industrial strategy, and leaving the long-term future of the economy to the short-term vagaries of capital markets, it is great to see this very positive reassertion of the value of manufacturing and the need for sustained rebalancing of the economy.”</p>



<p>Mr Mills is also the founder of JML, a consumer goods distribution company, and a lifelong Labour supporter.</p>



<p>He said: “To achieve strong economic growth and make the UK a global powerhouse once more, we need to start with a solid manufacturing base. Our 10 proposed reforms set out today clearly outline the key steps the Government needs to take immediately to achieve economic prosperity.”</p>

<p>It may not look like much, but this is where tiny fibres are connected up to make big improvements in broadband speeds. Pleased to visit the Llanelli telephone exchange recently to see massive upgrade in progress as well as watching Openreach colleagues working out in Bynea to upgrade systems there … at last … seems a fair while since residents first drew my attention to problems. Sincerely hope this resolves them. Gave Openreach reminder list of other residents’ problems that I am still pursuing. </p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP appalled by chaos unleashed by Government failure to open Oasis Academy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/08/13/oasis-academy-chaos/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=oasis-academy-chaos" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is appalled by the news that the Oasis Academy is now not expected to open until September 2024.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the Department for Education, the Government state:</p>
<p>We are writing to you following our recent discussions to confirm that the current forecast realistic year of opening for the pre-opening Oasis Academy in South Bristol is now September 2024. The revised year of opening is due to a combination of factors which include the additional time taken to prepare a robust planning application and further detailed survey and design works since the feasibility stage have informed a more realistic programme. In addition, further investigation of the key risks, such as the demolition of the existing community centre, has also informed the revised programme.</p>
<p>As a result of the revised year of opening, the Department will proceed to develop a business case to explore the feasibility of opening the school in temporary accommodation for 2023. This assessment will include detailed discussions with the trust, Oasis Community Learning, the appraisal of available sites, and value considerations for the spending of public funds. Any decision on temporary accommodation will be subject to Department approval.</p>
<p>The Academy trust, Oasis Community Learning, already runs eight academy schools in Bristol and has faced these failings before. Back in February 2021 they announced that the Temple Quarter School was supposed to open in 2018 but will not open until 2024 at the earliest.</p>
<p>In a recent House of Commons debate, Karin Smyth MP raised her deep concerns that Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) were not being held to account for their actions and that the Government were failing the children and parents in Bristol South to ensure they are at the heart of education.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“Parents, carers and children in Bristol South will be dismayed at this news of a delay in opening this new school, which represents another complete failure by the Department for Education and Gavin Williamson MP, the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>“All of the factors mentioned in the Department’s statement have been known for some time, this late announcement of a delay to a school due to open in less than thirteen months is a disgrace.</p>
<p>“Bristol City Council are now trying to sort out this mess and find temporary accommodation for 2023. Once again, local government is left carrying the burden of central government policy and implementation failures. I will be demanding an explanation from the schools minister for this monumental fiasco.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/08/13/oasis-academy-chaos/">Karin Smyth MP appalled by chaos unleashed by Government failure to open Oasis Academy</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish has today called on the Government to do more to help personnel, veterans and their families find work after they leave the Armed Forces. Gwynne’s comments follow the news that the Government will not fulfil one of its key veteran’s employment pledges.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Government announced plans to employ 100 specialist advisers – or ‘Armed Forces Champions’ – in job centres across the country. But Ministers now admit that just half that number will be hired.</p>
<p>The change means that there will be just one Armed Forces Champion to support every 14,000 working age veterans into employment. And a single specialist adviser could be set to cover all job centres in the whole of Denton and Reddish.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for veterans is 7%, almost double level for the general population at 4.8%.</p>
<p>Ministers have faced criticism from Labour and Service charities that their Armed Forces Bill doesn’t provide any further assistance to Forces personnel, veterans and their families to gain employment. The Government told its MPs to vote against a Labour amendment to widen the scope of the Bill at Report Stage to include provisions to support veterans into work.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Forces personnel, veterans and their families urgently need more support to find work. Yet the Government have broken their pledge to provide specialist advice.</p>
<p>Across Denton and Reddish charities and community groups have constistently come together to support veterans, yet have not had their actions and efforts matched by the Government.</p>
<p>Veterans and service personnel have sacrificed so much for this country, and ministers must now take action and outline how they will support veterans into employment, and fulfil their promise to provide specialist advice.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey commented:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Ministers are failing our Forces personnel and veterans. They have outstanding skills from their military service but many need help to get civilian employers to see their talents or to deal with problems in getting work.</p>
<p>Labour want to see Ministers do more to support our veterans get work and successful civilian careers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Stewart Young has sent a pre-action protocol letter to the Government, challenging their decision to split Cumbria into two new councils.</p>
<p>Cumbria's Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron said: <em>"Launching a legal challenge against the reorganisation plans will be a waste of public money and time and I would strongly urge Stewart Young to reconsider.</em></p>
<p><em>"Liberal Democrats in Cumbria passionately believe that we should instead be focusing on serving local residents and concentrating on working on the issues that matter to them like jobs, schools, social care and the environment."</em></p>
<p>Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group on Cumbria County Council Peter Thornton said: <em>"We have just 18 months to create two new Cumbrian councils from the seven existing councils.</em></p>
<p><em>"The County Council Liberal Democrat Group believe that we should be concentrating on this task rather than expending time and money challenging the Government's decision."</em></p>

    <title>Dunne welcomes £405k flood alleviation funding for South Shropshire</title>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Additional funding to protect against flooding in South Shropshire has been welcomed by local MP, Philip Dunne.</p>

<p>The Government is investing a record £5.2 billion in flood and coastal defences over the next six years to better protect 336,000 properties. Last week the government published the Investment Plan which sets out around 1,000 schemes across England which will receive investment in the first year of the programme.</p>

<p>In South Shropshire, flood relief works to surface water and ordinary watercourse flood areas east of Church Stretton have been allocated £375,000, and a further £30,000 will support the Alveley Flood Alleviation Scheme.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The devastating scenes of flooding in Europe recently show how important it is to invest in proper flood defences. When severe rainfall sets in, unfortunately areas of South Shropshire are prone to flooding, so I am pleased the government is investing £405,000 in two schemes in South Shropshire in this first year of the new flooding investment plan.</p>

<p>“There is clearly a need for a holistic approach to flooding along the Severn, but this is welcome investment. I am continuing to engage with Ministers alongside other Shropshire MPs for a long-term solution to localised flooding, as well as with the Environment Agency to press for sorting out specific areas in South Shropshire where flood schemes are still required to protect properties prone to flooding in recent years.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Government has also set out further action to improve access to insurance and to support Flood Re to achieve its objectives. This includes a commitment to make changes to the Flood Re scheme, which will see it support householders through discounted insurance premiums for those who have installed property flood resilience measures like flood doors and air brick covers. The changes will also help provide additional funding from Flood Re as part of an insurance claim after a flood to help ‘build back better’ in a flood resilient way.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Coronavirus issues and other local matters.<br/>
<strong><br/>
International Travel</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I have been asked by a number of people about the current rules for travel outside the UK and returning here. To find out what the rules are for entering any other country, you should look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Office Travel Advice</a>, which will tell you what the entry requirements are at the moment in each country.</p>
<p>For re-entering the UK, all of the current advice is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>South Western Railway &amp; Network Rail Timetable Consultation</strong></p>
<p>South Western Railway and Network Rail have launched a consultation about their plans for the post-Pandemic timetable from December 2022 onwards. This consultation is based on an assumption that considerably fewer people will be commuting going forward. The proposals represent a significant downgrading of the pre-pandemic timetable for our line into London Waterloo. They are intending to reduce the number of trains from Ashtead and Epsom in the peak from six trains an hour to four. This would be done by scrapping the services that start at Epsom and making the previous semi-fast service stop at Ewell West and Stoneleigh instead, as well as at all stations further in. At the same time they would make the current reduction in off-peak services permanent.</p>
<p>They will also at the same time introduce the new generation of trains onto our line, which are ten coaches with all of them connected to create an open plan route right through the train. Their argument is that the new trains will have significantly more capacity and will be able to carry as many people as before even with a reduced service. I do not buy that argument. I have met the company to raise my concerns about the plans, and I think it is much too early to judge what passenger numbers will be in nearly eighteen months time. This level of service would have been completely unworkable with pre-pandemic passenger numbers. I would encourage everyone to take part in the consultation and to make your view clear. The details are at <strong><a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/timetables/timetable-consultation-december-2022">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom &amp; Ewell Business Awards 2011-2021</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Epsom and Ewell Business Awards have just been launched for online entries and nominations. This will be the tenth year of the awards, and it’s a great opportunity to nominate your favourite local business, perhaps because of what they have done for you during the pandemic or because they just always look after you really well. Details of how to enter or nominate an entry are <strong><a href="https://www.epsombusinessawards.co.uk/">here</a></strong>. Please do get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering in the Local Community</strong></p>
<p>I know that many people locally put their names forward to volunteer in the community during the pandemic, and either have now finished that work or did not find the right opportunity to do so. If you are someone who is motivated to get involved or frustrated because your help wasn’t needed, I am planning a volunteering event to match potential volunteers with a small group of local charities who need extra help.</p>
<p>The event will be at <strong>St George’s, in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead on Friday 10th September</strong> from 4 until 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I will be sending out more details a few days before, but if you are interested please make a note in your diary.</p>
<p>I hope that you manage to enjoy something of a break this summer and that the weather improves.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br/>
Chris</p>

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, has welcomed a £5 million investment into Middleton on the Wolds-based Soanes Poultry on a recent visit to see the improvements for himself.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">A family-run business since 1947, all of the chickens at Soanes Poultry are grown on farms within 22mi of the factory in Middleton on the Wolds. The £5 million investment, which includes a brand-new training hub as part of a series of initiatives to recruit and retain workers, was set to increase the company’s output by 20%.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">However, due to ongoing labour issues in the sector, they have instead been forced to cut back their production by around 10% as their workforce is down by as much as 20% due to changing immigration patterns. These changes have been put down to a combination of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic by Nigel Upson, Managing Director at Soanes, who is also concerned about fatigue among the remaining workforce.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Speaking after the visit, Nigel Upson said: “With a large number of migrant workers returning home as a result of Brexit and then the pandemic, we simply don’t have enough people to meet our current production levels, let alone expand it by 20% as we’d planned.</span></span></p>

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“I recognise the Government wants to focus on investing in the UK’s domestic labour force, especially given the rise in unemployment due to the pandemic, and we’ve built a state-of-the-art training facility in recognition of this.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“But the shortages we’re facing are happening now, not in the future, and bringing UK workers into our sector is easier said than done, especially in the short-term. Unemployment is about 3.4% in the East Riding, and with around 3% being widely recognised as essentially being full employment, there simply aren’t enough local people to fill our vacancies.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“This is why we’ve asked Graham to raise the shortages with Ministers in the Home Office.”</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">According to AIMS, the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, demand for meat is expected to be higher than usual this summer, with many more people holidaying in the UK instead of travelling abroad. The fear is that supply chains aren’t able to cope due to the shortages.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham commented, “It was really interesting to see the significant investment they’ve put into the company over the last couple of years and I hope this helps to support nearby farmers and create local jobs in the years to come.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“I know my colleagues in the Treasury, the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs have been engaging extensively with the sector in recognition of the issues it’s facing.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“The Government’s ‘Plan for Jobs’ has innovative schemes to boost employment, like the Kickstart Scheme and the Lifetime Skills Guarantee, and the fact that predicted peak unemployment has gone down from 12% to just 6% shows that it’s generally working.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“However, I know from speaking to Nigel that there are still improvements to be made and that there could be more of a focus on his industry. All these various issues being at play is why I’m urgently seeking meetings with Ministers to raise Nigel’s concerns with them.”</span></span></p>

    <title>Christina Rees MP backs the Labour Party safer communities campaign following pledges to crack down on anti-social behaviour</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/christina-rees-mp-backs-the-labour-party-safer-communities-campaign-following-pledges-to-crack-down-on-anti-social-behaviour/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, has backed the Labour Party’s safer communities summer campaign as the Party pledges to crack down on anti-social behaviour and end violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>The Tories have cut police to the lowest level in a generation and cut funding for services that prevent crime from happening, leading to the loss of thousands of officers on the frontline and a £1.6bn shortfall in funding.</p>
<p>These decisions have helped cause a surge in anti-social behaviour, leaving people afraid in their homes.  Latest figures show that in this year alone police have recorded over 2 million incidents of anti-social behaviour – the highest in seven years.  This is just a fraction of the estimated 13.6 million adults who have witnessed or experienced anti-social behaviour during the same period.</p>
<p>The Labour Party would prioritise making communities safer by redirecting the £280 million earmarked for Boris Johnson’s new UK Government yacht and spend it in areas like Neath to tackle anti-social behaviour, putting more police on the beat in our communities, and strengthening legal protections for victims of antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, said:</p>
<p>“The Tories in Westminster are weak on crime, cutting police and prevention services with little thought of how communities, such as ours in Neath, will suffer as a result.</p>
<p>“The Welsh Labour Government have stood up against Tory cuts by funding 500 Police Community Support Officers.  A UK Labour Government would support them by giving victims more rights in law and putting more police officers on the beat.</p>
<p>“Together, Welsh and UK Labour would prioritise making our streets safer, instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on a flashy new UK Government yacht like Boris Johnson.  People shouldn’t be afraid in their own homes, and it doesn’t have to be like this. It’s time for the safety of our communities to be taken seriously.”</p>

			<p>I have recently been selected as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee to scrutinise the Government’s Online Safety Bill and would like to ask, you,  the public for your views on the draft legislation.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Bill, published by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-online-safety-bill">government in draft form</a> in May 2021, is designed to establish a new regulatory framework to tackle harmful content online.</p>
<p>The Committee, who will report its findings to the Government before 10 December 2021, is asking the public for their views on whether the draft law will achieve its aim of making the UK ‘the safest place to be online.’</p>
<p>This Bill is about finally putting a legal framework around hate speech and harmful content, and ultimately holding the tech giants to account for the role their technology plays in promoting it.</p>
<p>The next step in this process is the detailed scrutiny of the draft Bill. This is key piece of legislation that will update our laws for the digital age and we need the public to help by sending us their views.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly spoken out about abuse and harmful content shared on social media and this is an issue that the All Party Parliamentary Group on Compassionate Politics, which I Chair, has also been examining.</p>
<p>I look forward to joining colleagues from the Commons and Lords on the Joint Committee to work together to go through this Bill line by line to make sure it’s fit for purpose.</p>
<p>The Committee is specifically seeking views on how the Bill compares to online safety legislation in other countries, and whether it represents a threat to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Anyone with views on the bill can submit them here: <a href="https://bit.ly/3Cb12AI">https://bit.ly/3Cb12AI</a></p>

    <title>OMIW ARTICLE: UK Govt Must Rectify Errors Made for WASPI Women</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/omiw-article-uk-govt-must-rectify-errors-made-for-waspi-women/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=omiw-article-uk-govt-must-rectify-errors-made-for-waspi-women" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For years women born in the 1950s have been fighting for pension justice, including over 7000 women living here in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey.</p>
<p>Despite paying year after year into their pension, over 2.6 million women born in the 1950s have to wait up to an additional two and a half years before they can retire. All because of ham-fisted changes made many years ago that adjusted pension qualifying ages for women from 60 to 65, increasing to 66 years of age from 2020.</p>
<p>Successive UK Governments failed to tell these women about the pension changes which were agreed back in 1995—leaving many of them without adequate time to plan for their future. The first many knew about the changes were when they saw reports in the news many years later.</p>
<p>Determined to fight this injustice, women affected came together and set up a Women Against State Pension Equality campaign group. The WASPI women have been fierce and unwavering in their drive to get the justice they deserve. My SNP colleagues and I will continue to do all we can to support their campaign to urge the UK Government to right this wrong.</p>
<p>Last week, their campaign received another significant justification when the independent Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) found that the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) had dragged its heels over crucial communications with those affected by the changes.</p>
<p>The UK Government sent targeted mailings in 2009 to inform those affected, but letters paused again in 2011 while legislation affecting the very same women passed through Parliament, adding to the confusion. Letters then resumed in 2012 – by then, it was too late for women who had planned the next stage of their lives around what they had understood to be their retirement age.</p>
<p>The WASPI campaign group point out that although the letters sent out were concise, clear and targeted, they were ultimately useless because they were delivered so late – over 14 years after the changes were agreed. Women had been expecting their pensions, had no time to plan for their very delayed retirement. Those who had made decisions on out-of-date knowledge were left high and dry.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman’s report is damning of the DWP’s handling of communications with the women affected, effectively finding that ministers continued to take the same action despite knowing it wasn’t working and that women were being left in the dark about their retirement.</p>
<p>We all accept that changing life expectancy patterns requires governments’ response, but the treatment these women have endured is profoundly unfair. Had they been informed about the pension changes, they would have had time to plan, and for many, that would have included making different financial decisions.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, women born in the 1950s have suffered an enormous injustice that the Ombudsman has now recognised. They’ve been robbed of the retirement they deserve. Its high time the full effect of the catalogue of errors by successive administrations is accepted and rectified by the UK Government.</p>

    <title>Catching up with Beach Access North East</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/catching-up-with-beach-access-north-east/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Recently I was delighted to meet up with Beach Access North East (BANE), a charity with a mission to provide wheelchair users with access to our spectacular beaches across the North East.</p>



<p>Back in 2018 I along with BANE started a campaign to bring these specially adapted wheelchairs to our beach, I remember how much my Gran loved coming to the beach and how much it affected her when she became a wheelchair user and was unable to get onto the sand or close to the sea anymore. I remember all the children I worked with in my former career who never got to feel the sand between their toes or the splash of the waves. That BANE is now a part of our gorgeous South Shields beaches makes me so happy.</p>



<p>I want to say a special thank you to the dedicated volunteers who help people loan a full range of specialised equipment free of charge to wheelchair users in South Shields and other nearby locations, without them the scheme would never have worked, because of them wheelchair users get to enjoy our beach and the sea in a way they were never able to before.  I just wish my Gran was still here to experience it.</p>



<p>​To loan BANE equipment for free contact them on 0300 999 4444 or info@beachaccessnortheast.org​, alternatively visit their website <a href="http://www.beachaccessnortheast.org/">here</a>. </p>

    <title>New benefit is open for applications from island residents</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/07/28/new-benefit-is-open-for-applications-from-island-residents/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is highlighting the launch of a new benefit which is now open for applications from island residents as part of a pilot scheme started by the Scottish Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applicants in Na h-Eileanan an Iar who are looking after a child or young person with mobility or care needs as a result of a disability, or who has a terminal illness, should apply to Social Security Scotland for Child Disability Payment, rather than to the UK Government’s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for Disability Living Allowance for Children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pilot will be followed by a full national roll-out across Scotland later this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the first application-based disability benefit to be introduced by the Scottish Government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children and young people who currently receive Disability Living Allowance for children from the Department for Work and Pensions do not need to apply for Child Disability Payment. The transfer of Disability Living Allowance for cases will take place this Autumn. This will include moving the case from the Department for Work and Pensions to Social Security Scotland and replacing the Disability Living Allowance for children award with Child Disability Payment. Clients who have their benefits transferred will receive the same rates and components of Child Disability Payment they received in Disability Living Allowance and will be paid on the same schedule.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information, contact Social Security Scotland by phone on 0800 182 2222 or visit mygov.scot&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Robin Walker said: “I send my congratulations, and those of the nation, to Adam Peaty on another amazing gold medal. Also to Tom Daley and Matty Lee after their sensational performance receiving gold medals. I will be continuing to cheer on the rest of Team GB as the action continues.</p>
<p>We are fortunate in Worcester to have a number of fantastic clubs and I hope the excitement of the Olympics will provide the motivation for many residents to be #InspiredToTry any of the fantastic sports of swimming, para swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming or artistic swimming.</p>
<p>People can find their local clubs by using Swim England’s club finding tool here <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/ZrUJCGv3jfQ1Gr2cpkwni?domain=discover.swimming.org/">discover.swimming.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Robin Walker said: “Who knows, the next Adam Peaty, Ellie Simmonds or Alice Dearing could start their future Olympic journey in our pools! But even if we don’t unearth the next Olympic superstar, the joy and health benefits being part of a club can bring is more than worth it on its own.”</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my July&nbsp;email newsletter. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well during this challenging time, as we start to try to return to normality from the pandemic and enjoy the Summer, whilst still trying to be cautious and sensible with precautions where possible&nbsp;in the face of rising cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is only right that at this critical juncture in our journey out of lockdown, we take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices of the wonderful people who make up our NHS, our key workers, and all those involved in the vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you&#8217;ll find updates on the latest cases and vaccination restrictions, a link to my new online survey and details of what&#8217;s been happening in Parliament and around Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Online Summer Survey – let me know your views:</u></strong></p>



<p>As we head towards Summer Recess in Parliament, I’m about to start delivering my annual report across Amber Valley – please say hello if you see me out and about.</p>



<p>In the report and online, I’m launching a survey to get your views on local issues and recovering from Covid-19, from health appointments to boosting our economy.</p>



<p>Please take just a couple of minutes to complete my Summer Survey and let me know your views <a href="https://www.nigelmillsmp.com/nigels-summer-survey/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing Lockdown Restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 19<sup>th </sup>July 2021, the Government lifted all remaining restrictions on social distancing in England. This represents a further step towards normality as we adjust to living with this virus. Although coronavirus cases are continuing to rise nationally, we have not seen the corresponding rise in hospitalisations and deaths that we would expect given the rates of illness we observed last year. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly clear that the link between infections and serious illness is sufficiently broken to enable this further relaxation of restrictions. However, we must remain careful and exercise our own good judgement to keep transmission in our local community to a minimum.</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Case Rates</u></strong></p>



<p>The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant continues to spread across the country and Public Health England (PHE) is now confident that it has overtaken the Alpha variant to become the most dominant strain of the virus circulating in the UK. The Delta variant is believed to be around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which itself is more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. Encouragingly however, new analysis by PHE shows that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.</p>



<p>As predicted in light of this, cases continue to rise nationally, and this trend is no different locally in Amber Valley. You can find the latest case data <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read?postcode=DE7%206DG">here</a>. We are now ahead of the England average which highlights the need for us to remain careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Vaccines</u></strong></p>



<p>The Country’s vaccine program continues apace with more than 46.2 million people in the UK having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine &#8211; part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.</p>



<p>I was pleased to see the rollout expanded after the Government hit its target of offering a first jab to everyone in the top priority groups &#8211; all those over the age of 50, plus those in high-risk categories by mid-April. With every adult in the UK now having been offered their first dose of the vaccine. A terrific effort, nationally and locally.</p>



<p>As of last Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> July, Amber Valley had successfully given at least one dose of the vaccine to 88% of local adults, with 72.8% having received both jabs. This remains slightly above the average for England which stands at 87.7% of adults having received one jab, and 68% both jabs. These figures are a testament to the exemplary vaccine program here in our constituency.</p>



<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team, and the local NHS to ensure that this area continues to see the full roll out of vaccines.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing of restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>As of Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July, all legal restrictions on social distancing in England have been lifted. This is truly excellent news, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing Amber Valley businesses, organisations, and individuals operating at full capacity without legal restrictions.</p>



<p>The following measures are now in place across England:</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on how many people can meet.</p>



<p>&#8211; 1m-plus rule removed (except in some places like hospitals).</p>



<p>&#8211; Face coverings no longer required by law.</p>



<p>&#8211; Nightclubs can open.</p>



<p>&#8211; Pubs and restaurants no longer table service only.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on guests at weddings and funerals.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on people attending concerts, theatres or sports events.</p>



<p>&#8211; No restrictions on communal worship.</p>



<p>It is important to remember, however, that this easing of restrictions is designed to empower ourselves as individuals to use our common sense to slow the spread of the virus, which is still very present in our communities. Therefore, I implore you to enjoy these new freedoms responsibly.</p>



<p>As ever, to find out more information on what restrictions apply in your area please look <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting our local economy</u></strong></p>



<p>As we try to re-open, it&#8217;s key to support our local economy to bounce back, and provide a boost to local jobs and businesses. Unemployment is Amber Valley is currently at 4.2%, which is below the national average of 5.6% and 150 lower than in May 2021. As the Job Retention Scheme (furlough) starts to wind down, we need to remain cautious, but there are lots of vacancies around and local employers advertising job opportunities, including the Kickstart Scheme to help young people get back into work. I&#8217;ll also look to organise a Job Fair, maybe initially virtually, over the next few months &#8211; please get in touch if you&#8217;d like to be involved in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Borders Bill</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve recently welcomed the Government’s New Plan for Immigration, also known as the Borders Bill, into parliament. This legislation intends to:</p>



<ul><li>Speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals.</li><li>Introduce maximum life sentences for people smugglers.</li><li>Empower the Border Force to do more to stop and seize small boats and search containers for hidden migrants.</li><li>Stop illegal arrivals gaining immediate entry into the asylum system if they have travelled through a safe county (like France).</li><li>Increase the maximum sentence for illegally entering the UK.</li><li>Grant resettled refugees indefinite leave to remain.</li><li>Better integrate refugees who are resettled.</li></ul>



<p>I know constituents want more to be done to reduce illegal immigration. I will, therefore, continue to engage with ministers throughout this Bill’s journey through parliament to ensure the Government delivers on its manifesto commitments of reducing illegal immigration to UK.</p>



<p><strong><u>In Parliament:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament this month, I&#8217;ve been asking questions on travel restrictions, catch-up education and English Votes for English Laws legislation.</p>



<p>During recent questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, I raised the issue on behalf of constituents of families with children under 18 wanting to travel abroad, but who aren&#8217;t eligible for the vaccine as yet. I&#8217;m pleased the Secretary of State agreed to look into this issue, and you can find out more on his answer <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-19b.670.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g680.4">here</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also asked the Secretary of State for Education about catch-up tutoring for school pupils following the pandemic, and you can find the full debate on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-06c.768.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g776.0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, during Business Questions in the House, I asked about the continuation of English Votes for English Laws legislation, as part of a continued fair settlement of devolution across the UK. You can find more on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-06-24b.1011.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1023.2">here</a>&nbsp;and on my Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/nigelmills">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also find more on my recent parliamentary appearances and questions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pid=24965&amp;pop=1#n4">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Solar Farm</u></strong></p>



<p>Locally, I’ve been working with local residents and councillors to help oppose plans to construct a 310-acre solar farm on a vast swathe of green space between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. The solar farm has been proposed by Kronos Solar and is subject to several planning applications across Amber Valley Borough Council and North East Derbyshire District Council. I think this would destroy our local landscape due it&#8217;s scale and extent, so whilst I&#8217;m not against renewable energy or solar panels, I think these applications are inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The applications are still awaiting determination by the councils (likely to be in September) so there&#8217;s still time to comment or lodge any concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find details of the residents&#8217; objection group, and information on the individual applications and how to comment if you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savealfretoncountryside/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council Local Plan consultation &#8211; Have your say!</u></strong></p>



<p>The new administration at the Borough Council has launched a new consultation on the next stage of preparing Amber Valley&#8217;s Local Plan, a development document which will set out and plan future housing growth in the area, and making sure we have the infrastructure improvements to match any new homes. I welcome the planned reduction in the overall number of new homes being proposed, which is part of the consultation. The Council are also consulting on the options for the overall strategy (spatial strategy) of the plan, which include focusing housing growth on the Derby City urban area border, in and around Amber Valley&#8217;s four key towns, or in the wider area and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation on the proposals and headline strategy for the plan so far is open from now until the 30th September 2021. Please do take opportunity to feed in your views to the Council &#8211; I know how strongly residents rightly feel over housing in our area, and so this is the most important chance to have your say on making sure we protect our Green Belt and shaping&nbsp;the future of planning in our area. You can find the consultation and how to submit your views on the proposals <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/alternative-spatial-strategy-options-for-housing-and-economic-growth/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Street Watch:</u></strong></p>



<p>As always, if there are any street repairs in your area, such as potholes, pavement repairs or broken street lights, you can report these issues and concerns to me quickly and easily&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/street-watch/">here</a> so I can ask for the repairs to be investigated and addressed.</p>

&lt;p&gt;In response to a question at July Full Council, the Portfolio Holder for Finance and Resources has called on the Government to retain the £20 a week uplift in Universal Credit&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;highlighting how it supports many low paid working people in Nottingham.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham and in response to the pandemic in April last year the Government introduced an increase in payments of £20 a week. There is growing speculation that the Government will reverse the uplift later this year resulting in increasing difficulty for many people who are already struggling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to a question at Full Council on the issue, Cllr Sam Webster said “Universal Credit supports low paid working people in our city, tens of thousands of children in our city and people who are entitled to support with housing costs or have lost their job during the Covid pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Webster commenting on the
consequences of the £20 a week uplift being reversed warned that “It will often
be felt most acutely by Nottingham children who are growing up in families
where there already isn’t much money around, families who are living in
poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January this year Nottingham City Council passed a motion urging the Government to retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit and urging an extension of the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support. This was followed up by a letter from the Leader of Nottingham City Council to the Chancellor emphasising the importance of the £20 a week uplift. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cllr Webster continued his response by saying “Lower paid and lower skilled working people are much more likely to have lost their job, not be able to work from home, have additional childcare needs, have gone through periods of Covid isolation without receiving pay, have lost hours at work&amp;#8230;.and the list goes on.&amp;nbsp;Reducing Universal Credit now would be big blow to many families who are already struggling to make ends meet.” He also argued that the uplift in Universal Credit should be seen as a litmus test for how seriously the Government is about levelling, saying to not make the uplift permanent would be a case of “levelling down”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cllr Webster ended by saying “In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago it was (and still is) shameful that the poorest people in this country were made to pay the price of mistakes made by the wealthiest. In terms of the policies that our national politicians pursue &amp;#8211; this is one of those markers &amp;#8211; who will The Conservative Government expect to pay for this latest economic and public debt crisis?&amp;nbsp; The message from Labour in Nottingham is crystal clear &amp;#8211; let it not be the poorest families again.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>After holding a constituents surgery in the morning, Mr Shapps went to the Galleria in Hatfield to visit Potential Kids. There, Grant went to see how they had been doing since the launch of their ‘Learn to Ride’ sessions earlier in April.</p>
<p>Potential Kids is a local charity that provides learning, social and sport opportunities to children who are neurodiverse, as well as their families. Their ‘Learn to Ride’ programme provides 1 on 1 bike riding lessons to children.</p>
<p>Speaking about the visit Angela Gaughan, founder of Potential Kids said: “We were delighted to have the opportunity to talk with the Grant Shapps about the joint project between Hatfields Mens Sheds and Potential Kids.</p>
<p>“Being able to teach children and young people to ride and maintain a bike provides life-long skills that promote independence, mental health and self-esteem, whilst encouraging physical activity and time spent outdoors in the fresh air.</p>
<p>“Grant also had the opportunity to see our Community and Learning Garden project, ‘Potential to Grow’, which has been successfully running over the last 11 months.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for the support we have received in developing this project. Our continued thanks go to Tim Sterling, Center Director at the Galleria for our Hub and Garden and to Welwyn Hatfield Council for their support to build our new kitchen area. Which will enable us to run fun cooking sessions for neurodiverse children, young people, their siblings, and families in the local area, using healthy ingredients grown in our very own garden.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “Potential Kids look to be doing brilliant work here. I’ve spent a bit of time talking to the leaders here and learning about their work, and the cycling programme more specifically.</p>
<p>“Cycling is great way to get from A to B- it’s healthy for you, and great for the planet. Learning to ride a bike as a child is something that all kids should experience, and it’s great to see that Potential Kids are helping make sure every child has that opportunity.”</p></div>

Mr Shapps toured some recent changes in the town centre, including a new outdoor dining area.</p>
<p> A representative of WGC BID said: “<span style="font-size: 14px;">We thank Grant for taking time out of his very busy schedule to come to WGC town centre and hear about the BID renewal and how the businesses in WGC are coping with the impact of the pandemic. </span></p>

<p>Mr Shapps said: “As we are moving away from covid restrictions- thanks in no small part to our amazing vaccination effort- it’s vital that our local businesses can get back on their feet and adapt to life post-covid.</p>
<p>“Visiting the town centre in Welwyn Garden City today and meeting with the local BID group, I’m confident that we’ll be able to spring back and make the most of what life post-covid has to offer.”</p></div>

<p>Mr Shapps- who is also the UK Transport Secretary- met with Tricia and the team at Off Broadway Travel to listen to their experience of international travel in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The meeting came as Mr Shapps recently announced that double vaccinated Brits would no longer have to isolate after travelling to ‘amber list’ countries from 19 July.</p>
<p>Natalie Bennett, a partner at Off Broadway Travel, told Travel Weekly: “He took everything on board, he listened to us, and it went well. He appreciated that travel had been made illegal and said he would talk to the chancellor [about further sector specific support].</p>
<p>Off Broadway Travel tweeted after the visit, saying: “A very productive meeting with @grantshapps today our local MP. Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to listen &amp; understand out sector….”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “I had a very useful discussion with the team at Off Broadway Travel today. They told me about the challenges they’ve faced as a business  over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>“As we unlock domestically, and take some first steps towards flying internationally again, I want to make sure I’m best representing all parts of the transport sector.”</p></div>

    <title>KEEP HARBORNE HIGH STREET BANKS OPEN</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/keep-harborne-high-street-banks-open" type="text/html"/>

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>On Friday 16 July, residents will gather on Harborne high street, in order to protest against the closure of their local banks.</p>
<p>Planned closure of the branch of Santander on Harborne high street would leave members of the local community more vulnerable, as well as create even more problems for the community hotspot.</p>
<p>From Thursday 5 August 2021, the Harborne based bank is set to close, adding onto the 7,400 other bank closures since 2010.</p>
<p>Following a survey sent to around 1000 people surrounding the high street, it was revealed that 89% of people visit the bank branches on Harborne high street on a regular basis, with 89% of people also unable to travel 4 miles to the nearest bank, located in the city centre.</p>
<p>For citizens with disabilities or mobility issues, a trip into the inner city just to access banks would be both extremely difficult and unnecessarily polluting for Birmingham’s already poor air quality. This, as well as the new clean air zone strategy which has recently been implemented in the city centre, would mean that it could cost people £8 just to go to the bank.</p>
<p>As well as environmental issues which would arise because of this inaccessibility, 44% of people only use in-person banking, with 27% of people not understanding how online banking works, or lack internet access, making them the most vulnerable people in the community.</p>
<p>HSBC are also planning to shut down their Harborne branch, looking to become a virtual only bank, also preventing customers from solving issues in person.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, has called on Santander to reverse their decision, for the benefit of their customers and the local community, saying “Over the last decade, our high streets have suffered, seeing more and more empty units appearing. Following the pandemic, I do not want to see this trend continue. Harborne High Street should be a place that the community is proud of and is one that includes the pivotal services Santander provides its residents.”</p>

    <title>5 Secrets of the Best Webinars</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/5-secrets-of-the-best-webinars/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>There seems to be a webinar for everything — from cooking an apple pie and setting up your email list to creating a company and making your first million. This form of interaction with the target audience became popular for a good reason. It allows to achieve numerous goals:</p>



<ul><li>Selling products</li><li>Attracting new audience</li><li>Improving engagement</li><li>Building and improving brand awareness</li><li>Creating an image of an expert for yourself or your company</li><li>Distributing content</li></ul>



<p>And that’s we’ve just scratched the surface. Every person who creates a webinar has their own unique goals in mind. This wide array of benefits is what makes webinars such a great way to promote your brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="706" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-164" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-325x211.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-166" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

&lt;p&gt;“It would, however, have been better for all concerned to have avoided the worry and trauma in the first place,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ms Cummins had challenged the RFL on the process and decision that saw Bradford losing out in the award of Elite Academy licences. She questioned whether quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and deep roots into the community game had been given little weight in the consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Bulls Academy has been productive and respected for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There remain challenges ahead but I’m looking forward to working with and supporting the club and the RFL to make sure that the sport has a healthy future,” said Ms Cummins.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
