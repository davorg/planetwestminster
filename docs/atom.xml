    <title>The Oxford Union  believes the right can represent the working class.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/05/15/the-oxford-union-did-not-believe-the-right-cannot-represent-the-working-class/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Thursday I was one of the speakers at the Oxford Union debate on the motion “This House believes the right cannot represent the interests of the working class”. I was dismayed by the dated, arrogant, condescending and foolish motion. It was as if we were still living in the mid nineteenth century, with Marx telling us all to see things through the prism of class. Then there were three classes of rail carriage and liner cabins, in an age when people with money hired domestic servants and many adults including all women still did not have the vote. Today most of us are workers, and many workers now work with brain and computer. Machines dig ditches, speed the construction of buildings, make things in factories where before hard labour was needed from the hand and arm of man. All adults have the vote, and many adults aspire to what a class campaigner would call a middle class lifestyle. The many want and expect a good home of their own, a family car,  tv, washing machine and holiday away that were the prerogatives of the better off seventy years ago.</p>
<p>The proposers of the motion elided “working class” with poor as the left seeks to do. There was no allowance in their backward looking view for the better paid workers , and every assumption that the minority that is temporarily on benefits is the norm and the core of their “working class”. There was no recognition that centre right parties often get elected, represent the workers and go on to get re-elected. There was even less understanding of why that should be. The left in the UK have never forgiven Margaret Thatcher for having great appeal to many of their chosen working class. They ignore the popularity of policies which allow people to keep more of the money they earn, to own their own homes and to gain a stake in the wealth of the nation through their savings, pension plans, ISAs and the rest.</p>
<p>The arrogance of the motion was poignant a few days after Angela Rayner’s important quote that “for too long we (Labour) have given off an air of talking down to people and telling people what they need, or even what they should want or what they should think.” The Oxford union narrowly voted down this archaic foolishness. Many people want a hand up, not to live on hand outs. Politicians should not seek to lecture people on what they should believe, think and want, but should seek to compete to offer people more and better service related to their problems and above all to their aspirations. The aim of debate is persuasion, not stern correction.  Most people aspire to live in a better home they own, to own a better car, to have some money in the bank and to have more freedom to choose. Few aspire to live on benefits in a rented flat under the control of the state as paymaster, landlord, policeman and social worker. I pointed out that the students at Oxford, assembled from so many backgrounds and all income levels, are surely united in seeking a better life for themselves through personal effort. By excelling at school and College they aim for well paid jobs and comfortable homes. Why seek to deny this upward mobility to others or pretend that the right does not have policies that can help achieve these aims?</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-52/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Monday, as vice-chair of the APPG on Cancer, I met with Rebekka Smiddy from McMillan Cancer Support to listen to their plans to support our APPG. McMillan Cancer’s wonderful message is: “We will move mountains to help people with cancer to live life as fully as they can. We’ll do whatever it takes”.</p>
<p>Tuesday was taken up with the State Opening of Parliament and the Queen’s Speech which included the UK Government’s proposed legislative programme for this session of Parliament. The UK Government promised to level up opportunities across all parts of the UK but this Conservative Government has an appalling record of providing Wales with a fair share of UK spending, let alone the funding needed to level up. Despite promising that Wales would not lose out when EU Structural Funding ceased, the replacement Community Renewal and the Levelling Up funds will provide just a fraction of that EU funding. The Levelling Up Fund will represent little more than £50 million each year for Welsh projects, compared with over £375 million per year from EU Structural Funds. And it will be delivered by a Whitehall-led, centralised, ad-hoc approach, instead of the previous delivery by Welsh Government in collaboration with Local Authorities.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Parliamentary Labour and Co-operative Group met to discuss the outcomes of all the elections held across the UK last Thursday. We now have 938 Labour and Co-operative Cllrs, 5 of 7 Metro Mayors, and 7 PCCs across the UK. In Wales we have 16 Labour and Co-operative Party MS in the Senedd, an increase of 5 from 2016, and 3 of the 4 PCCs represent the Labour and Co-operative Party. In Parliament we shall continue to campaign on many issues including: doubling the size of the co-operative sector, food justice, financial inclusion, fair tax, employee ownership by seeking to introduce a Macora Law, and protection for shop workers.</p>
<p>The Times published <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/companies/2021/04/26/mps-question-lv-chairman-on-demutualisation/">a letter</a> from the APPG for Mutuals, of which I’m an officer, in which we asked the Governor of the Bank of England to intervene in the proposed sale of LV (Liverpool Victoria) to the US private equity company Bain Capital. We highlighted our concerns and raised a number of very important questions regarding the proposed demutualisation of LV.</p>
<p>On Thursday South Wales MPs had our regular update with South Wales Police Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan and South Wales PCC Alun Michael. We all congratulated Alun on being re-elected last Thursday, and we listened to the progress of the partnership model advocated by Jeremy and Alun. Jeremy introduced us to the new Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Bacon and emphasised that community safety and neighbourhood policing will be at the forefront, and welcomed the additional 100 PCSOs pledged in the Welsh Labour Manifesto. Domestic abuse, drug misuse and mental health issues will be a very important part of their early intervention strategy.</p>
<p>The APPG for Steel met the UK Government International Trade Minister Ranil Jayawardena to discuss our campaign to urge the UK Government to extend steel safeguards beyond the current expiry date of June 2021. The safeguards were introduced to limit further increases in imports because of a dysfunctional global trading environment for steel, overcapacity of steel, US trade tariffs, and increased use of global defence measures. The safeguard measures allow for tariff-free imports equivalent to 111% historic levels with further relaxations every year, and provide a careful balance between different industrial industries. If the UK unilaterally removes its safeguard measures, it will open up our market to import surges as we recover from the pandemic and at a time when our exports to EU and US are subject to tariffs and quotas.</p>
<p>On Friday, as chair of the APPG for Sepsis, I met with Dr Ron Daniels and Sarah Hamilton-Fairley of the UK Sepsis Trust ahead of our APPG AGM next Tuesday. The UK Sepsis Trust explained their latest campaign to raise Sepsis awareness in organisations and in communities: “Be Sepsis Savvy. Spot the Signs. Save Lives”. Sepsis is the body’s life-threatening over-reaction to an infection, including Covid-19. Without timely treatment it can lead to organ failure and death. This devastating condition is responsible for over 48,000 deaths a year in the UK – more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer combined. But if Sepsis is diagnosed quickly, it is often treatable, so it’s important to know the signs in adults and in children, and get to your GP or to A&amp;E as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I want to pass on my congratulations to all the wonderful Welsh Labour MSs who have been returned to and elected to the Senedd, and to thank all the fantastic campaigners and volunteers who helped make this happen. I am so proud to be a Welsh Labour MP and I am looking forward to working in conjunction with our MSs and our Welsh Labour Government to help improve the lives of the people in Wales. We need a strong Welsh Labour Government in Cardiff to be a strong voice for the people in Wales, especially given the Queen’s Speech was so disappointing in its lack of vision and ambition. Now is not the time to be dealing with unimportant bills that invent problems that aren’t there. Now is the time to be making fundamental changes to the challenges that we as a society face. We do not have a problem of voter fraud in this country; ID cards to vote will cause more problems than they fix. We do, however, have a huge problem of rising inequality from health to education to housing. The people of the UK deserve a Government that will tackle those fundamental challenges that they face on a daily basis.  Here in Wales, I know our Welsh Labour Government will do just that.</p>
<p>The Reading Agency are once again launching their <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/children/quick-guides/summer-reading-challenge/">Summer Reading Challenge</a> to encourage children aged 4-11 to set themselves a reading challenge to help prevent a summer reading ‘dip’. Children can read whatever they like – fiction, fact books, poetry, joke books, picture books, graphic novels, audio books and eBooks can all be used to complete the Challenge. Children receive special rewards each time they finish a book and there’s a certificate for everyone who completes the Challenge. The Summer Reading Challenge is open to all primary school aged children and is designed for all reading abilities. Children can sign up for free at a participating library during the summer holidays. We know how important reading is for children and their life opportunities – reading has been shown to be more important for a child’s cognitive development more than a parent’s level of education or social class. Instilling reading as an enjoyable activity from a young age is therefore so important. Reading should not be a chore!</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but as always, we are available should you need to get in contact with us. I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <title>Dear Newcastle May 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/05/dear-newcastle-may-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Dear Newcastle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that we have spent over a year now in various forms of lockdown with so much loss of life and so much sacrifice by so many. We hope that there is a sustainable path out of the Covid restrictions and that we can build back a fairer, better society.  A big part of this is the vaccine rollout, which continued to be successful in the North East with  great co-ordination between the NHS, Public Health professionals and volunteers. Our infection rates have reduced to around 40 per 100,000 but this is still the highest amongst the seven local authorities and twice the UK average. However it is positive that despite easing of certain restrictions we have not seen any spike in infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But part of building back better is investment in local communities and businesses and we are yet to see a plan from this Government that does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Newcastle it was good to see non essential shops opening in a covid secure way. So many local businesses have suffered during lockdown, it is important to support them as much as possible. I want to thank everyone who has followed the rules during this difficult time and I hope everyone can look forward to a better spring and summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parliament my work focused on  two of the Bills I am leading on for Labour – the National Security and Investment Bill and the Advanced Research and Innovation Bill – as well as continuing to highlight the impact of the pandemic, and Brexit, on the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backbench and Constituency Role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was great to be able to be able to have some face to face meetings, in accordance with Covid restrictions, to hear direct from constituents what their concerns were!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government’s Race Report was published, refusing to recognise institutional racism. I heard from many constituents concerned about the report and worked with colleagues and comrades to co-ordinate a response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding issues and demands for support for constituents and businesses as we follow the roadmap out of lockdown, the Horizon scandal and the need for a government inquiry, the life cycle of electric vehicles, medical care for veterans and identity theft. I have contacted numerous members of the Cabinet with questions that arose as a result of the student open meeting I hosted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out and about at the Elections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Shadow Ministerial and PES Role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Online Safety Bill will be introduced in the new session and we continue to engage with stakeholders with regard to what should be in it! There is significant interest in adding aspects of online harm not currently covered such as financial harms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working on the launch of our Digital Report on May 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.  I spoke to the Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee the importance of a proper regulatory framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Parliament returned mid April the  ARIA Bill had its Committee Stage. We are supportive of the Bill but feel changes are required to make it more effective and accountable for example the fact the Government wants to exempt it from Freedom of Information Requests and normal procurement rules is worrying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The National Security and Investment Bill came back to the Commons for ping pong  with the Lords over Intelligence and Security Committee oversight. Despite concerns expressed by many members of Parliament and peers the Government refused to budge!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>I was therefore delighted to join Sense about Science’s policy panel yesterday to share my insights on how scientists can better promote their work in Westminster – with students from across the country.</p>

    <title>Step 3</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.philipdunne.com/news/step-3" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">  &lt;div data-history-node-id="6952" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-date field--type-datetime field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;14 May 2021&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;div class="field field--name-field-page-builder field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field--items"&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, England marked a day with no recorded covid deaths, for the first time since July 2020. This was an extremely timely and welcome milestone, as the Prime Minister confirmed that the country will move to Step 3 on Monday (17th May), in line with the anticipated date in the roadmap to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents the widest reopening so far, with the very welcome return of many freedoms that mean so much to us all. People will once again be able to hug family and friends, and care home residents will be able to have five visitors instead of the current rule of two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to welcome customers back inside, subject to the rule of six or two households, with table service, and the limit for outdoor meetings will increase to 30. I am sure I am not alone in looking forward to eating out on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinemas, theatres, and indoor play areas for children will all be able to reopen, as well as hostels, hotels, and B&amp;Bs. Everyone will be able to travel within Britain and stay overnight, so schools will also be able to organise trips with overnight stays – a big boost to the outdoor leisure sector in South Shropshire, which relies on residential visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms, or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. All remaining University students will be able to return to in-person teaching, where they should be tested twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country has reached this stage thanks to the combination of continued respect for the rules by the public, and the remarkable success of the vaccine rollout. Over two thirds of adults across the UK have now received their first dose, and more than a third of adults have received a second dose as well. Cases of Covid in South Shropshire remain low, below the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this unlocking is extremely welcome, we cannot throw caution to the wind just yet. We should continue to consider the vulnerability of those we contact, and social distance when not with friends and family. Remember hands, face, space and fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister confirmed that we remain on track to move to Step 4 on 21st June, and will set out more detail later this month. But on current trajectory, and barring the emergence of new variants of concern, we continue to move along the path back to normality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday South Shropshire will take a giant step forwards to restoring a vibrant return to normal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Is Gdańsk the answer for islands shipping troubles?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/05/14/is-gdansk-the-answer-for-islands-shipping-troubles/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP, Angus MacNeil has said that all possible options need to be investigated to fill the islands ferry problems given the latest problems with the Loch Seaforth’s late return to service.&amp;nbsp; Mr MacNeil is also suggesting that another boat be built in Gdańsk for the fleet of CalMac vessels on the west coast of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3426" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/20210211_170121-2/" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg" data-orig-size="3088,4128" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1.9&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;SM-A202F&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1613062880&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;3.6&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;80&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0.01&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="20210211_170121" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=224" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=766" alt="" class="wp-image-3426" width="372" height="497" srcset="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=372 372w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=744 744w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=112 112w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/20210211_170121.jpg?w=224 224w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Angus MacNeil said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a problem with the CalMac fleet on the west coast of Scotland.&amp;nbsp; The MV Loch Seaforth was built in Germany and launched 7 years ago and is currently out of service, having had numerous problems since coming into service. The newest boat previous to that MV Finlaggan launched 11 years ago, was built in Gdańsk in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need to get other boats in play sooner rather than later.&amp;nbsp; The problems on the Clyde are well documented, there are many promises but it seems that nobody in Transport Scotland, CMAL or CalMac are confident of when the Glen Sannox might arrive to ease the problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The CalMac fleet is ageing and the Pentalina apparently requires work before it can even be trialled.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps given the number of boats that are going to be needed consideration should be given to going back to Gdańsk where the Finlaggan was built or to Flensburger in Germany.&amp;nbsp; Other boats will be required even if the Glen Sannox and Hull 802 are completed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Finlaggan cost in the region of £25 million in 2010 and it was suggested at the time that Gdańsk could have built another one for about 85% of that cost, having familiarised themselves with the job, however, I’m sure that is not the case today.&amp;nbsp; The Loch Seaforth was £42 million four years later, it was indeed a bigger boat but one way or another we are going to need quite a number of boats over the next few years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, with the current problems we have we are probably going to need quite a few yards building and therefore it may be time to look to Poland or other ship building nations to provide the vessels we need.&amp;nbsp; We will need a number of vessels if we are going to prevent further summers of restricted capacity due to the ageing fleet and the problems this brings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are a plethora of organisations involved in this between CalMac, CMAL and Transport Scotland but one way or another, we have to cut through that forest and get boats sailing on the west coast and that means that we should be using yards with a track record in building this kind of ship.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

  <summary type="text">This afternoon, South Lakes MP Tim Farron has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, urging him to drop "dangerous and counter-productive" plans to introduce calorie labelling in hospitality venues.
The Department of Health and Social Care have announced that from next April, all large restaurants, cafes and takeaways will be required to display calorie information on menus and food labels.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This afternoon, South Lakes MP Tim Farron has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, urging him to drop "dangerous and counter-productive" plans to introduce calorie labelling in hospitality venues.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Social Care have announced that from next April, all large restaurants, cafes and takeaways will be required to display calorie information on menus and food labels.</p>
<p>However, the eating disorder charity BEAT has warned that the move would be "dangerous" for people living with eating disorders.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Secretary of State, Tim said: <em>"While I acknowledge that this move comes with the best of intentions, I am deeply concerned about the significant impact it will have on people living with an eating disorder.</em></p>
<p><em>"Of course it's really important that in the fight against the obesity crisis in this country we equip people with as much information as possible to make better informed choices. However there are serious risks here in people becoming fixated with calorie numbers in a very unhealthy way which can lead to mental health problems.</em></p>
<p><em>"Eating at restaurants can already be highly anxiety provoking for people with eating disorders, and this move threatens to make things even worse.</em></p>
<p><em>"Creating a culture of shaming people for what they eat will not help us tackle obesity, but instead drive more and more people into having eating disorders, and exacerbate the problems for those who are already diagnosed.</em></p>
<p><em>"I therefore urge you to listen to what eating disorder charities such as BEAT, campaigners and specialists are telling you and drop these extremely dangerous and counter-productive plans."</em></p>

<p><strong>Article written by Russell Lynch and posted on The Daily Telegraph Website</strong></p>



<p>Scribbled on a whiteboard in Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng&#8217;s Victoria office is a lengthy list of tasks which one departmental wag labelled the &#8220;Unblocking List&#8221;.</p>



<p>Four months on from taking over the brief, the minister has ticked off quite a few of the 20 or so jobs already. But one of the biggest should be scrubbed off this week when a key plank in the UK&#8217;s post-Brexit architecture is unveiled in the Queen&#8217;s Speech.</p>



<p>Earlier this year Kwarteng&#8217;s department consulted on the shape of new subsidy controls for a newly independent nation since the end of the transition period after decades in the European Union&#8217;s state aid regime.</p>



<p>The topic may not stir the blood of campaign rallies, but the eventual shape of the new subsidies regime could help ministers take a big step towards ambitions on &#8220;levelling up&#8221; the regions and building green energy industries. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably one of the most important bits of legislation that we can do as it will affect how the Government spends the public&#8217;s money,&#8221; a Whitehall insider says.</p>



<p>Compared with other EU nations, the UK is under-subsidised. It spends around £4bn a year on subsidies but as a share of its GDP the 0.4pc spent in 2018 was three times less than Germany. We also spend a fraction of the amount seen across the EU overall on regional development, according to the Institute for Government, at around 2pc compared to an average of around 15pc elsewhere.</p>



<p>Traditionally, the UK&#8217;s more Anglo-Saxon approach to capitalism has made it more suspicious of state intervention than mainland Europe, and it has been a strong backer of the EU&#8217;s state aid regime for the purposes of keeping its former partners in check.</p>



<p>There are signs of that approach shifting. Ministers are still sifting through the responses to March&#8217;s consultation, but experts are already alive to the potential offered from December&#8217;s Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) with the EU.</p>



<p>For starters, the deal lifts the minimum subsidy to be covered by the new regime to around £340,000, compared to (EURO)200,000 (£174,000)</p>



<p>under the old EU rules, increasing the leeway to deploy them. The joint declaration on subsidy controls accompanying the TCA also highlights specific provisions for the &#8220;&#8216;development of disadvantaged or deprived areas or regions&#8221;, airports, road and infrastructure projects, as well as research and development.</p>



<p>Gone too are bureaucratic quirks of the EU state aid machinery such as &#8220;assisted area maps&#8221; or &#8220;aid intensity caps&#8221; which limited support for struggling areas. Tom Pope, the IfG&#8217;s senior economist, said the hallmark of the regime is its flexibility and that ministers could take advantage of the leeway: &#8220;There is more flexibility to provide more money to the &#8216;red wall&#8217; seats when not all of the red wall was included in the assisted areas.&#8221;</p>



<p>He adds: &#8220;The reason why we&#8217;re in a good position here is that state aid is a system that is restricted by the fact that it has to apply to 27 different countries, and it&#8217;s all regulated by the Commission. We can design a system that is tailored to the UK&#8217;s needs, so there&#8217;s a potential there for a really big win.&#8221;</p>



<p>A senior Government source said the overall level of UK subsidies was unlikely to go up, although the amount funnelled to the regions &#8220;probably will&#8221; as Boris Johnson&#8217;s administration looks to shift investment away from the South East towards a new flock of Conservative supporters.</p>



<p>The source said: &#8220;The Treasury models essentially reinforce expenditure in the South East: the cost benefit ratio is always better in terms of infrastructure, and of course that&#8217;s a virtuous cycle. So the more you invest in an area, the more productive it is and the more attractive it is to subsequent investment. We need to bring that cycle to drive growth in other parts of the country.&#8221;</p>



<p>A new subsidy control regime should formalise that drive in policy when eventually enshrined in legislation, although many hurdles lie ahead. Experts warn the current legal limbo between the end of the old framework and the new rules could stay the hand of local authorities in committing subsidies for fear of breaking the law.</p>



<p>Despite the Government&#8217;s regional ambitions the threat of &#8220;subsidy races&#8221; also needs to be addressed to prevent Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland outbidding each other inefficiently with taxpayer cash to attract industry from elsewhere in the UK. The consultation paper mooted bans on such bids, as well as an independent UK body to set the rules of engagement and prevent court battles.</p>



<p>But a legal fight already looks inevitable over Article 10 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which says that UK subsidies which affect trade between the province and the EU would have to follow Europe&#8217;s state aid rules. The EU has taken a hugely broad interpretation of Article 10, even arguing that a subsidy to a bank in London might theoretically give a credit advantage to an NI based manufacturer, and come into its orbit.</p>



<p>The UK naturally takes the opposite view. James Webber, a partner at law firm Shearman and Sterling, told MPs earlier this month that the system was &#8220;completely unworkable&#8221; and &#8220;unexploded ordnance&#8221;. Pope adds: &#8220;This hasn&#8217;t been tested and at some point there will be a case which goes to the ECJ which tests how far that reach-back mechanism extends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Further clashes could be likely on the &#8220;level playing field&#8221; provisions which proved such a sticking point in negotiations last year. Simon Virley, KPMG&#8217;s head of energy, says the Government&#8217;s eagerness to maximise the UK&#8217;s economic benefits from investments in sectors like offshore wind could eventually bring it into conflict with the EU.</p>



<p>He warns: &#8220;There is a tension here between trying to maximise UK jobs and investment and the &#8216;level playing field&#8217; conditions in the Brexit agreement, plus the Government&#8217;s stated commitment to continue to follow key principles that underpinned the EU state aid rules, like necessity and proportionality. Its room for manoeuvre is constrained &#8211; if the UK tries to diverge too far from these principles, the EU will cry foul.&#8221;</p>



<p>Energy intensive sectors like steel and chemicals are meanwhile concerned that any overhaul of subsidies as ministers focus on the &#8220;green revolution&#8221; may put them at even more of a disadvantage to international rivals if not handled sensitively. The Energy Intensive Users Group, which noted that the UK has not used its &#8220;full flexibility&#8221; under the EU state aid regime, warned existing reliefs were &#8220;vital&#8221; and any redesign should avoid unintended consequences.</p>



<p>Andrew Large, the EIUG&#8217;s chairman, said: &#8220;The foundation industries are significant recipients of support on energy and climate change issues, albeit by no means competitive with countries such as Germany and France. If the level of support falls, then we will deindustrialise as investment leaks to those jurisdictions that continue to support their foundation industries.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even as industries put their hand out, the Government&#8217;s push towards new subsidy controls to further its political ambitions is taking it into territory many traditional Conservative MPs consider uncomfortable.</p>



<p><strong>John Penrose</strong>, the MP who authored a competition report for the Government earlier this year, is no fan of subsidies. He said: &#8220;If used sensibly, the new regime could be a boon to regional development but the Government should make sure that the overall level of subsidies doesn&#8217;t go up &#8211; and that any regime doesn&#8217;t stand in the way of market forces.&#8221;</p>



<p>The MP&#8217;s warning for ministers is stern: &#8220;In general Governments are dreadful at picking winners, but losers are brilliant at picking politicians so we don&#8217;t want to be in a situation where we are pumping taxpayer cash into failing industries.&#8221;</p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP condemns the Government for neglecting the social care crisis in the Queen’s Speech</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/05/13/karin-smyth-mp-condemns-the-government-for-neglecting-the-social-care-crisis-in-the-queens-speech/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=karin-smyth-mp-condemns-the-government-for-neglecting-the-social-care-crisis-in-the-queens-speech" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, condemns the Government’s failure to deliver on their promises to tackle the social care crisis or even set out a plan, which is neglecting millions of people currently receiving inadequate care and leaving families subjected to years of financial, physical and mental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;658 days ago, Boris Johnson said he had a “clear plan” for fixing the social care system, and promised to bring forward plans for reform.  There were expectations that these plans would be introduced in the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday, yet the Government failed to include any mention of social care reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families across the country are reliant on adult social care, from dementia care, long-term illnesses to Special Education Needs.  Government failure to cap social care costs and increase the number of spaces available in social care facilities is making care more difficult to access, leaving families dealing with growing pressure, anxieties and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social care has been a fragmented sector propped up by underpaid and undervalued staff for too long. The pandemic has brutally exposed the fundamental flaws in a system which so many people depend on, resulting in unbearable stress being put on families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last year has only increased the urgent need to reform the system, yet the Government continue to fail to deliver on their promises.  The longer we wait, the longer people will receive inadequate care, and hospitals will be unable to discharge people due to the shortage of social care places. As someone who previously worked in the NHS I can tell you that without joined up thinking between health and social care we will never sort out the issues facing our NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important that we see plans for reform so we can develop a sustainable social care system which can properly support the growing number of people who rely on it to live a happy and healthy life. It’s time for the Government to step up and put plans in place for meaningful and effective change, be more transparent on plans to reorganise the system, and offer our hardworking NHS and social care staff the pay rise they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

On Saturday, I watched as Andy Burnham stormed to a second term as Mayor of Greater Manchester. He won with a stunning 67.3% share of the vote (up from 63% in 2017) and now has an extraordinary mandate to lead Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>As the chair of Andy’s campaign, I was naturally ecstatic with the result, but I was also excited about what Andy’s second term as Mayor could mean for the people of Tameside.</p>
<p>I have written extensively about the transport revolution that is required in Tameside (and indeed across Greater Manchester). I know that myself and Andy share a common goal in creating a transport network that works for everyone in Tameside.</p>
<p>In March, Andy announced that Greater Manchester would take control of its bus network again. This means Greater Manchester will become the first place outside of London to have a regulated bus system since the 1980s. We’ll have control of fares, timetables and routes, and residents will be able to hop on and hop off Manchester buses and know how much their tickets will cost. The aim is to have a London-style transport system over bus and tram by May 2024.</p>
<p>But this plan is only the beginning. As we come out of lockdown, it is vital that we focus on providing a transport network that is both sustainable and practical.</p>
<p>I have called for greater connectivity on our railways, and I am pleased that Tameside Council is bidding for funding in the region of £40 Million to transform the town centres and transport infrastructure in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge. I have spoken before about the scope for a Metrolink tram-train line between Stalybridge and Manchester Airport, and am keeping my fingers firmly crossed that this bid succeeds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bee network scheme is coming to Tameside – and is anticipated to provide a 1,800-mile network of walking and cycling routes across Greater Manchester once it has been completed. This scheme will create walking and cycling routes across Tameside and will cut air pollution and tackle congestion.</p>
<p>I truly believe that these transport schemes, plus a Mayor that fights tooth and nail for Greater Manchester, will make a real difference to the lives of the people of Tameside. Let’s get moving and start the transport revolution!</p>

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tory plans will see over 1 million people in our region become ineligible to vote </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/tory-plans-will-see-over-1-million-people-our-region-become-ineligible-vote" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>In the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday, plans were announced to launch a new mandatory voter ID system. While it might seem like a sensible step forward, in practical terms, it would require voters to have accepted forms of ID to take to the ballot box.  </p>
<p>In the West Midlands, only 79% of people have a passport. That’s 1,149,137 who would no longer be able to vote. This number drops even further, to 75%, when talking about the number of voters with a driver's licence.  </p>
<p>These new measures which the Government wish to introduce will politically silence more than a fifth of people in the West Midlands and is a dangerous precedent to set against our democratic rights.  </p>
<p>The Conservative Government are looking to put this in place, at a cost of around £20 million per election in a bid to prevent voter fraud. While preventing voter impersonation is a laudable goal, it is a costly and unnecessary one and simply distracts people from the growing issues that are at the heart of our country. </p>
<p>At the elections in 2019, the Police found that of the 58m votes cast, just 33 related to voter impersonation. This means a £20 million cost will be enacted to address something which affect 0.000057% of all votes. Surely, there must be a more cost-effective solution which can be found for such a relatively non-existent issue? </p>
<p>Most concerningly, we do not have information on how this will affect minority groups or low-income households. There is only data available to tell us about the age, sex and region of ID holders. </p>
<p>The pandemic has shown us the stark inequalities that are rife throughout our country and are growing. While solutions to address some of these inequalities might be more complex to correct, this is straightforward. Simply, do not introduce legislation that will have a disproportionate effect on those who are already facing a huge imbalance. </p>

&lt;p&gt;Events at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT FROM JUDITH CUMMINS MP&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I share the concerns of the many hundreds of constituents who have contacted me about the Sheikh Jarrah evictions and the appalling and deteriorating situation in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. I condemn the attacks on civilians that have taken place in recent days.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are deeply troubling events and together with my Labour parliamentary colleagues I am pressing the UK government to act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many experts in the field and the United Nations’s spokeperson on Human Rights has stated, if the Sheikh Jarrah evictions are set in motion it would be a grave violation of Israel’s obligations under international law. The international community must hold the Israeli authorities to account for its actions and the UK government must step-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque site is sickening. &amp;nbsp;It would be abhorrent at any time but for it to take place during Ramadan is callous and can only fuel the enmity which has taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK government’s response to these events has been disappointing. &amp;nbsp;Britain cannot be a passive observer and must step forward to insist that the Israeli authorities stop the violence, injustices and violations of Palestinian human rights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I will continue to advocate for the rights of the Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, recently met with KCOM CEO Dale Raneberg to hear about the expansion in the telecoms giant’s work and to discuss plans to bring ultrafast ‘Lightstream’ broadband to “sluggish” parts of his constituency.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The meeting followed completion of KCOM’s build in Withernsea, which means that 95% of properties in the town are now ‘passed’ by new, fibre broadband that could offer speeds of up to 900Mbps. Ofcom, the regulator, defines superfast broadband as anything over 30Mbps (enough to download a film in around 4 minutes) while ultrafast speeds are over 300Mbps.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In the meeting, Mr Raneberg committed to connect Withernsea residents to the new infrastructure for free, if they take out one of KCOM’s ‘fibre-to-the-premises’ packages.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In response to a Government request to boost access to better internet speeds, particularly when more people than ever before are working remotely, KCOM have introduced a new, cheaper ‘Flex Package’ for people in receipt of benefits such as Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Pension Credit.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham said, “It was a real pleasure to meet with Dale, just after KCOM have finished their extensive build in Withernsea. The pandemic has shown just how important it is for people to have decent internet as families battle over access to their emails, video calls and Netflix.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“The Government wants to rollout gigabit-capable broadband to 85% of the country by 2025, and I’m keen for my constituency to benefit sooner rather than later with the help of KCOM. It’s also great news that the Government has relaunched its voucher scheme, which can offer up to £3,500 off the cost of building the infrastructure.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“I’ve been in touch with parish councils already, and I’d encourage any residents in rural areas who want to see faster speeds in their area to get in touch with me at grahamstuartmp@parliament.uk.”</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Currently, just over 95% of premises in Beverley and Holderness benefit from access to superfast broadband, while two-thirds have a FTTP connection. Nationally, these figures stand at around 97% and 22%.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Mr Raneberg added, “It was a pleasure to meet with Graham and hear that he shares our enthusiasm to cover Beverley and Holderness in full-fibre broadband.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“We want to give local residents the fastest possible speeds and we’ve shown this with recent builds in Withernsea, North Newbald and Bishop Burton. This has been helped by a recent expansion of our in-house engineering teams, which is creating more skilled jobs for local people.”</span></span></p>

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Inquiry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Kashmir (APPKG) is conducting an inquiry to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across Kashmir, with a focus on health, healthcare and humanitarian impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APPKG would like to collect written evidence on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;health, healthcare and humanitarian impacts, for example access to oxygen, ventilators and hospital beds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social and economic impacts, for example unemployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communication barriers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broader human rights issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity issues, including those citizens, men, women and workers disproportionally impacted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impacts associated with changes to the UK’s international aid budgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the adequacy and speed of the Covid-19 vaccination roll out in the region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the UK government and appropriate international bodies are monitoring the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish to understand the impacts of Covid on top of existing issues identified prior to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The closing date for responses is Monday 31 May 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to submit your evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions should be between 500-1000 words per issue (strict maximum limit of 3,000 words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joint submissions from organisations on specific issues are encouraged.  Please indicate clearly all organisations that support the evidence submitted. Please indicate if the submission has been published online or in print, and if so, when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each submission should include a brief introduction about your or your organisation(s), relevant email address and include factual evidence references, as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note we may publish all or part of your submission. If you wish for your submission to be anonymous or you do not wish any part of your submission to be published, this must be clearly stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (the DPA) together form a new framework for regulating the processing of personal data in the UK. The APPKG will only collect and use personal information for the specific purpose for which it has been obtained. The APPKG will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that we are not obliged to accept your submission as evidence for the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the time required to process and analyse evidence, late submissions will only be accepted with the agreement of the APPKG Chair, Debbie Abrahams MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written responses should be sent electronically, in Microsoft word or PDF format to the &lt;a href="mailto:abrahamsd@parliament.uk"&gt;abrahamsd@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:harpreet.uppal@parliament.uk"&gt;harpreet.uppal@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What happens next?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APPKG will consider all written evidence received before deciding upon those witnesses from whom it wishes to hear oral evidence from. They will be contacted in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you require alternative formats of this information or further assistance in making a written submission to the Committee, please do not hesitate to contact Harpreet Uppal on &lt;a href="mailto:harpreet.uppal@parliament.uk"&gt;harpreet.uppal@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie Abrahams MP, Chair APPKG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of all APPKG members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April 2021&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Probably the biggest event of the past few days is, oddly, something that is no longer happening. The removal of the Operation Brock barriers on the M20, which I have been urging on Ministers for a few weeks now, can be seen as East Kent’s own particular step on the road back to normality.

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Who would have thought at the beginning of last year that, in only a few months’ time, we’d be in a nation-wide lockdown to protect ourselves from a global pandemic? It’s been tough on everyone – keeping apart from loved ones, not going out to work, studying and learning from home. Businesses have been placed under enormous pressure, many of which are only still going today on account of the generous support the government has provided in the form of staff furloughs and other grants and loans.</p>
<p>Most tragically of all, we all know people who have lost friends and family. And we mourn them all.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also aspects of the last year we will look back on with pride. The way Welwyn Hatfield has pulled together. The resilience our local NHS staff have shown when working at any and all hours in the battle against this virus. Local charities and volunteers like Sarah Jamieson of Resolve, who literally moved in with the homeless people she was helping to find accommodation during lockdown. And, of course, all those involved in the Herculean effort that is our vaccination roll-out, some of whom I had the pleasure of meeting when I had my first jab at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One year and three lockdowns later, the remarkable rollout of our vaccine programme means that we’re now able to look forward to a cautious but final route back to normality. Well over 50% of all adults in the UK have now been vaccinated – no other major economy in the world has vaccinated its population faster. We know it will take time for things to get back to normal, but thanks to the fortitude of the people of Welwyn Hatfield, as well as the hard work of our scientists, our brilliant NHS workers, our military and the army of volunteers across the entire country, we are embarking upon the journey to recovery.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It’s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus &#8211; support for local businesses &amp; high streets:</span></strong></p>
<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
