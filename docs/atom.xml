  <title>MP warns DEFRA Secretary that Government plans could destroy the landscape of the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales</title>

  <summary type="text">On the floor of the House of Commons yesterday, local MP Tim Farron told DEFRA Secretary George Eustice that Government's new agriculture plans could destroy the landscape of beauty spots such as the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales.
Speaking in Parliament, Tim said: "British farming genuinely is the best in the world, fundamentally because of the family farming unit upon which it is based.</summary>

<p>Speaking in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"British farming genuinely is the best in the world, fundamentally because of the family farming unit upon which it is based.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Government's plan to deliver environmental goods through the environmental land management scheme is good and laudable, and we support it.</em></p>
<p><em>"However, the transition whereby, in a revolutionary way, people will lose half their income in three years' time - when the average livestock farmer is reliant on basic payment for 60% of their revenue- will lead to hundreds upon hundreds of those family farms going out of business and therefore not being in a position to deliver those environmental goods by 2028.</em></p>
<p><em>"The landscape of the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales is shaped by centuries of family farming. By accident, the Government could undo all of that in a few short years - even months - so will the Secretary of State think again, not penny pinch, and make sure that the basic payment is rolled over in full until the point at which the environmental land management scheme is available for everyone?"</em></p>
<p>In response, DEFRA Secretary George Eustice said: <em>"The concept of area-based payments has only been around for about 15 years, and it has not always been in the interests of agriculture.</em></p>
<p><em>"The truth is that farmers may be the recipients of the BPS, but they are not the only beneficiaries: the BPS payment has inflated land rents and input costs, prevented people from retiring, and also prevented new entrants from getting on to the land.</em></p>
<p><em>"That is why we believe there is a better way to pay and reward farmers in future."</em></p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim said: <em>"I'm very disappointed that the Secretary of State completely ignored my question and failed to give our local farmers any assurance whatsoever that they will be given the financial support they need to survive the tricky years to come.</em></p>
<p><em>"Our farmers feed us and maintain our wonderful landscape - they deserve better."</em></p>

<p>The outstanding work of UHBW staff has been recognised by local MPs, with two award wins at the South West NHS Parliamentary Awards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joshua Bell, a nursing assistant at Weston General Hospital, has won the ‘NHS Rising Star Award’, and the ‘Excellence in Urgent and Emergency Care Award’ has gone to the South West Critical Care Transfer Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The South West Critical Care Transfer Service was piloted in April 2020 to help relieve pressure on the region’s hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, by safely moving critically ill patients between intensive care units.</p>



<p>Dr Scott Grier, the South West Critical Care Network (SWCCN) Lead&nbsp;for Transfer, was tasked with developing this service and, incredibly, it was ready to launch in just nine days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collaborating with the South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWASFT) and the Nightingale Hospital Bristol, hosted by North Bristol NHS Trust, they developed the concept and brought together components of the SWCCN, Great Western Air Ambulance Charity, Wiltshire Air Ambulance Charity&nbsp;and the SWAFT Hazardous Area Response Team (HART).</p>



<p>The service utilised dedicated vehicles, medical staff and equipment, reducing demand on hospital resources, and supported by a team of specialist paramedics redeployed from the air ambulances and HART.</p>



<p>This ground-breaking service operated for four weeks before being put on standby, ready to respond in case of a second wave. In that short time it transported a total of 35 patients, visiting every intensive care hospital in the Severn region (Bristol, Gloucester, Cheltenham, Swindon, Bath, Weston-super-Mare, Taunton) as well as London, Wales and Devon.</p>



<p>Following the success of the pilot and the extremely high standard it was able to operate at, the concept was developed further and led to the commissioning and launch of Retrieve, a dedicated South West Adult Critical Care Transfer Service, which is one of the first of its kind in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retrieve, which is now hosted at UHBW, will transfer adults aged 16 and above and compliments WATCh (Wales &amp; West Acute Transport for Children Service) and NEST (Newborn Emergency Stabilisation and Transport Team), which provide similar services for children and newborns and are also hosted by the Trust.</p>



<p>Dr Scott Grier, lead consultant for the Retrieve service, said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am delighted that the South West Adult Critical Care Transfer Service has been nominated for an NHS Parliamentary Award. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This service was a collaboration between the South West Critical Care Network, South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust and the Nightingale Hospitals in the South West to deliver a new critical care transfer service to enable COVID-19 patients to be moved around our region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This temporary service has led to the development of&nbsp;Retrieve, an NHS commissioned Adult Critical Care&nbsp;Transfer Service for the South West &#8211; one of the first in the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It has been a privilege to work with a large number of colleagues and partners in the region to develop such a positive legacy from the pandemic, fundamentally changing the way critically ill and injured patients are transferring around the South West.”</p>



<p>Jack Lopresti, MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke, put forward the South West Critical Care Transfer Service’s nomination. He said:</p>



<p>“I am absolutely delighted that the South West Critical Care Transfer Service has been named a regional champion in the Excellence in Urgent and Emergency Care Award Category for the NHS Parliamentary Awards, and are on the shortlist for a national award next year.</p>



<p>“The Service was rapidly set up over the summer and has since been vital in our region’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. &nbsp;The staff work incredibly hard and should be very proud of their achievements this year. It was an honour to be able to nominate them for this important award.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Josh Bell is nursing assistant who is known across the Trust for his passion for healthcare. As a young child he received lifesaving treatment at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children (BRHC) and has been dedicated to giving back to the NHS ever since.</p>



<p>He’s worked both at Weston General Hospital and at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, and has a particular interest in emergency and intensive care, especially in looking after patients with sepsis.</p>



<p>He has had to quickly adapt and learn throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes working at short notice and always providing the best patient care. Having been a patient throughout his childhood he is able to understand the needs of those he cares for, taking a holistic approach.</p>



<p>His dedication is further illustrated by the voluntary roles which Josh has taken on. He is the sepsis ambassador and champion at Weston General Hospital, a volunteer clinical educator for the UK’s Sepsis Trust, a Freedom to Speak Up advocate and, outside of the Trust, is an operational first aider with St John Ambulance. Josh has also supported the work of the lead resuscitation officer and the lead nurse for sepsis and deterioration of patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, Josh is an outstanding role model and a shining example of what perseverance, hard work and commitment can achieve.</p>



<p>Upon finding out about his award win, Josh said:</p>



<p>“It was a shock to say the least!”</p>



<p>“Being a nursing assistant in the NHS is an incredible career and I have met the most amazing people within my various teams.”</p>



<p>“Being able to support patients holistically and in their hour of need, especially in the emergency department, through my involvement with St John Ambulance and also supporting patients and their families who have been diagnosed with sepsis, is such a rewarding job to do too.”</p>



<p>“I can honestly say that working in the NHS, for me, is the best type of career and I would recommend it to anyone.”</p>



<p>“Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have seen that teamwork really does make the dream work, and I feel privileged to have been given this award for doing a career that I have wanted to do all my life.”</p>



<p>“I hope to go on to become a paramedic in the near future and also develop a sepsis support service to provide support for both staff and the patients and their families that we serve in our local communities.&#8221;</p>



<p>John Penrose, MP for Weston-super-Mare, submitted Joshua’s nomination to the NHS Parliamentary Awards. He said:</p>



<p>“Huge&nbsp;congratulations&nbsp;to Joshua, our very own NHS Rising Star!&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Winning this kind of award is impressive in normal times, but in the middle of a pandemic it’s outstandingly good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Many thanks Joshua; we’re all proud of you!&#8221;</p>



<p>Robert Woolley, chief executive of University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, said</p>



<p>“This is a fantastic achievement and I would like to congratulate both of our winners on receiving this recognition from our local MPs.</p>



<p>“They have proved themselves to be dedicated to providing the highest level of patient care, and are a credit to our Trust and the wider NHS.</p>



<p>“I would like to wish Josh and the South West Critical Care Transfer Service team the very best of luck for the national awards; we are very proud to call them members of Team UHBW.”</p>

    <title>Gwynne supports recommendations for ending HIV transmissions by 2030</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233103" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/World-AIDS-Day-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/World-AIDS-Day-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/World-AIDS-Day-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/World-AIDS-Day-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/World-AIDS-Day-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/World-AIDS-Day.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is supporting the HIV Commission&amp;#8217;s recommendations for ending HIV transmissions in England by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission&amp;#8217;s Report, released today on World AIDS Day, makes 20 recommendations focusing on the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stigma and health inequalities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a healthcare system which can take advantage of innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inequalities, including social and structural barriers to HIV testing and treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources and funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National and local leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnership and strengthening alliances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key recommendation is that testing for HIV should take place whenever blood is taken in England – regardless of the person’s gender, ethnicity or sexuality. The report finds that this is crucial to meet the Government’s pledge to end new HIV cases by its 2030 goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HIV Commission was established by the UK’s leading HIV charities Terrence Higgins Trust, National AIDS Trust and Elton John AIDS Foundation. It is chaired by Dame Inga Beale, the former CEO of Lloyd’s of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that currently around 5,900 people in England are living with undiagnosed HIV, which drastically increases the chance of unwittingly passing this virus on. Similarly, someone who receives a late diagnosis has an eight times greater risk of death compared to those diagnosed promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is a really important report and I would strongly urge the Government to implement its recommendations, which would represent a real step change in the fight to end HIV transmissions in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For a variety of reasons, thousands of people are unaware that they are living with HIV and we need bold action to ensure that this changes and to meet the target to end transmissions by 2030.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Press release: The PM is misleading us about how much he really knows about Covid-19 transmission.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah: “the PM is misleading us about how much he really knows about Covid-19 transmission.”&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the news that Newcastle will be placed in Tier 3 restrictions, Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah has written to the PM accusing him of misleading her in how much he knows about COVID-19 transmission in Newcastle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Said: &lt;em&gt;In October I asked the prime minister, in an oral question, if he knew where transmission was occurring in Newcastle, he said he did, so I then addressed three written questions to ministers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;to find out what they knew. The final question was eventually answered on Friday, over six weeks after I asked, and the responses to all three show that no, they do not know where transmission is occurring in Newcastle. Is it in bars or shops? Is it in the student community or front line workers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is important that we do everything we can to crush the rate of transmission of COVID-19. But the Government need to come clean with us about what they really know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The data the government is using to impose Tier 3 restrictions on Newcastle is from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of November, when data leading up to the 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; shows a marked decrease in Newcastle’s infection rate&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Why does it take them so long to process and collect the data?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In summary the, the government don’t know where COVID-19 is transmitted, are using old data, and are misleading the country on how much they know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Today, I am asking the Prime Minister: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why did he pretend he knew where transmission was occurring in Newcastle?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why won’t they judge us on up to date data?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why don&amp;#8217;t they give resources and data to local authorities who know local communities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Christmas break</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2020/12/01/the-christmas-truce/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>As the Prime Minister says,, the virus will not know it’s Christmas. He tells us to be jolly careful. </p>



<p>Nonetheless the government  proposes a five day period when we are free  to make more of our own decisions about social contacts in our homes with family. Some families will decide they do not wish to run any risk of infecting elderly or vulnerable people, and will not use the new freedoms to have a crowded house and table over the festive season. Others will decide that the risk is low for them of catching the disease at all  or for getting a bad version of it, and will go ahead and use the freedoms the  state permits.</p>



<p>Some elderly people will want the warmth and friendship of a family occasion and will assess their own risks accordingly.  </p>



<p>This has itself created a further debate. A few have contacted me to say the relaxation is too generous, as they fear some will make bad judgements. More contact me to say if we can be trusted to make these decisions for five days, why cannot this be extended or why can’t there be a more general relaxation of rules? People after all do not wish to pass on a bad disease to loved ones and can make their own decisions about risk. </p>



<p>Where the government can help and reassure is to see what can be done about train travel. Now the railway is fully under state control for the time being the state has a duty of care to passengers. What actions have been taken or are being taken to ensure safer airflows in  carriages? What evidence is there about spread rates for the virus at different levels of seat occupancy?</p>



<p>The railway is examining fare structures to avoid an incentive for more people to want to travel on an off peak train. Over a holiday period and in an era of homeworking off peak is a less clear idea anyway. They also need to renew the guidance about safe use of the railway and tell us what they think the risks are to inform people making those difficult judgements about family reunions over the five days of Christmas allotted. </p>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the statement to the House of Commons on the Government’s agricultural transition plan, Philip Dunne raises concerns about farming viability for those who will miss out on the environmental land management scheme pilots and that the scheme for new entrants risks consolidation of farming businesses into larger holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broadly welcome the thrust of these transition arrangements to improve the environment, although as a farmer I am concerned about farming viability—given the phased 50% cut in support over the next three to four years—for those who will miss out on the environmental land management scheme pilots for 5,500 successful applicants, until the new ELM scheme comes in from 2024. The Secretary of State is offering a lump sum exit scheme to encourage farmers to retire and a new scheme for new entrants from 2022, but in view of the high costs of mechanisation and the time to achieve the viability of a new enterprise, does that not risk continuing the process of consolidation of farming businesses into larger holdings, in particular in disadvantaged areas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=3934"&gt;George Eustice &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend makes an important point, and we are considering that in the design of our schemes. We are working with county farms across the country to improve the offer that county farms have, to create opportunities for new entrants and to encourage them into partnership with other landowners so that there can be more opportunities for those new entrants and to create an incubator model for these new entrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the viability of farms as we progressively reduce the basic payment scheme, it is important to recognise that this is an evolution, not a revolution. It is the case that from 2022 we will open the sustainable farming incentive to all farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-11-30/debates/d1556108-a152-4c24-a9a0-58c1c17c632e/CommonsChamber#contribution-234043E0-04DA-4E06-B3FF-DA54BB1B21C1"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>RELEASE: MP praises CAB for their Fair Delivery Charges campaign</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/release-mp-praises-citizens-advice-bureau-for-their-local-fair-delivery-charges-campaign/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=release-mp-praises-citizens-advice-bureau-for-their-local-fair-delivery-charges-campaign" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Highland MP, Drew Hendry has praised the Inverness, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey Citizens Advice Bureau and Nairn Citizens Advice Bureau for their local Fair Delivery Charges campaign; which seeks to raise awareness of the detriment caused to local people by delivery surcharging and the lack of transparency around the use of surcharges. The campaign led by Citizens Advice Scotland also seeks to promote the Scottish Government’s ‘Fairer Deliveries for All’ map tool, which allows consumers to explore delivery prices charged by different companies and create a more transparent system.</p>
<p>With online shopping rates growing by 129% in the U.K. during the pandemic, there is a real shift in how consumers are purchasing goods. However, consumers living in affected Highland areas still pay an average of 30-50% more for receiving items bought online than in the rest of the mainland UK. Further analysis carried out by the Scottish Government in 2019 found that consumers in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey paid over £7,000,000 in delivery surcharges, relative to the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>Mr Hendry has long campaigned against rip-off delivery charges and previously took a fairer delivery charges bill to the UK Parliament as part of his campaign to end excess delivery charges to rural areas. He also helped the Highland Council launch the national reporting tool it spearheaded as part of the ongoing work to end rip of delivery charges <a href="http://www.deliverylaw.uk/">http://www.deliverylaw.uk/</a>.  The SNP MP praises the CAB for their renewed efforts to support ongoing work to highlight the unfairness of excess delivery charges.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mr Hendry said:</p>
<p>“Every one of us living in the Highlands is familiar with the problem of unfair delivery charges; whether it’s surcharges being added to deliveries, or simply no delivery option available, despite offering delivery to mainland UK.</p>
<p>“Whilst I would always urge folk to support local where they can, we all know this is not always possible and consumers should not have to pay the price for companies shortcomings.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to see our local Citizens Advice teams prioritising this campaign and I would urge everyone in the Highlands to get behind it too, to raise awareness of ongoing unfair delivery surcharging faced by folk in the North of Scotland.”</p>
<p>“For my part, I will continue to press the UK government for legislation to end unfair delivery charges and take on companies charging constituents outrageous delivery charges. We can all play our part by reporting instances of excessive delivery charges at deliverylaw.uk, and folk can also make use of the Scottish Government’s Fairer Deliveries For All tool at <a href="https://fairdeliveries.scot/explore-your-postcode">https://fairdeliveries.scot/explore-your-postcode.”</a></p>

    <title>Covid Statement 26/11/20</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2020/11/30/test-trace-isolate-support/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today I asked the UK Secretary of State for Health a series of questions about the UK Government&amp;#8217;s response to the Covid crisis; specifically, the suitability of the new tier approach to restrictions in England and how much support is being made available for Covid contacts to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent King&amp;#8217;s College study found the vast majority of Covid contacts are failing to isolate. Failing to improve the existing &amp;#8216;test, trace, isolate&amp;#8217; strategy risks limiting progress in suppressing new Covid cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also completely ignored my question about the logic of allowing 1000 people at indoor events in high risk areas in England from next week. With only 15 allowed to attend weddings, it is hard to grasp the logic of this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can watch my full contribution to the statement here: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUa_zUJIFRg"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUa_zUJIFRg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="26/11 Covid Statement" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AUa_zUJIFRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Philippa Whitford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many scientists have expressed concern that the easing of restrictions at Christmas could lead to another surge of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;covid&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;cases in January. With cases still over 80% of the level at the start of lockdown, is the Secretary of State not worried that allowing outdoor events of 2,000 participants and indoor events of 1,000 in level 2 high-risk areas could drive up infection rates ahead of Christmas? Although lateral flow testing is very welcome, given how it increases capacity, the Secretary of State previously stated that the mass testing in Liverpool was a pilot and would be evaluated before being rolled out elsewhere. As the city has also been under tight restrictions and then lockdown, how will the impact of mass testing alone be evaluated? How does he plan to counter the lower uptake among deprived communities—the very ones at highest risk, as seen in Liverpool—and with no clinical evaluation yet published, how can he justify putting out contract tenders for an eye-watering £43 billion and rolling out this approach to 67 other areas? Should this strategy not be compared with investing money and energy in getting the traditional test, trace and isolate system working properly? Currently, over 40% of contacts in England are still not even informed that they should be isolating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Secretary of State knows that it is not testing, but isolation, that stops the spread of the virus. If people who are infected or could be carriers are not isolating, no amount of testing will stop viral spread. A study by King’s College London that suggested that fewer than a quarter were isolating when advised was incredibly worrying, so what assessment are the Government doing to clarify current isolation rates and understand the reasons why people may not follow the advice they are given?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hancock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we are constantly evaluating the impact of people isolating, and how many people isolate when asked to. I would encourage the hon. Lady to look at a broader range of studies than just that one from King’s College, especially those dealing with the self-isolation of those who test positive, for whom the rate tends to be higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hon. Lady asked about the use of these lateral flow tests to have a negative impact on the number of cases in an area. Of course, we have been evaluating this all the way through the study in Liverpool, which is why we can have confidence in rolling out more broadly across tier 3 areas. I included in my statement a high-level assessment of this. The number of cases in Liverpool city region is down by two thirds, but in the city itself, where the testing took place—the testing was of people who live in the city and of people who work in the city and live largely in the wider city region—the number of cases is down by over three quarters. That is one piece of evidence. It is clear that it is the combination of people following the rules and community testing, with appropriate incentives to get people to take up that mass community testing, that can help to make this work. We want to work with local directors of public health to understand how this can work effectively in their areas, precisely to reach those hard-to-reach people whom the hon. Lady mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I echo the hon. Lady’s request that we be cautious this Christmas. However, I am delighted that we have agreed an approach across the whole UK, including with the SNP Administration in Edinburgh, with the Welsh Labour Administration and the cross-party Administration in Northern Ireland, because there are so many ties that bind us together and mean that we are stronger as one United Kingdom, working together to tackle this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2020/11/worcester-mp-urges-caution-as-tiering-system-returns-across-the-country/"><![CDATA[<p>Worcester MP Robin Walker has urged caution as Worcester will move into ‘tier 2’ of the new restrictions come into force next week. The current national restrictions will end on December 2 and the tiering system will return across the country.</p>
<p>It was confirmed today that Worcester will come into the ‘high alert category’ which will see shops, gyms and personal care establishments re-open.</p>
<p>Robin urged people in Worcester to safely show their support for local businesses which have had to close down in the crucial run up to Christmas. Robin has also reinforced the need to comply with the new measures when they come in place to ensure that Worcester can move into the tier one, medium alert category.</p>
<p>Decisions on which area goes into which tier are primarily based on 5 key epidemiological indicators; case detection rates in all age groups, case detection rates in the over-60s, the rate at which cases are rising or falling, positivity rate (the number of positive cases detected as a percentage of tests taken), and pressure on the NHS, including current and projected occupancy.</p>
<p>The indicators are designed to provide a full picture of what is happening with the virus in any area so that suitable action can be taken.</p>
<div class="column">
<div class="letter-content">
<p>Robin welcomes the fact that Local Authorities in Tier 2 areas are being provided with additional funding to make cash grants to businesses that can remain open. These grants are primarily aimed at hospitality, leisure and accommodation businesses and are worth 70 per cent of the value of grants available to closed businesses in Tier 3 areas. He is also pleased to see grants for the self-employed increased from covering 20 per cent of profits to 40 percent, thereby increasing the maximum grant from £1,875 to £3,750.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first review of the tier allocations will take place on December 16, with the potential for areas to move down a tier before Christmas if they are making progress in slowing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Speaking after the announcement of the tiers, Robin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to again thank the people of Worcester for all the sacrifices that they have made this year and once again I urge people to comply with tiering system when it comes into effect so that we can move into Tier 1 as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>“From December the 2nd, businesses across the UK and in Worcester will reopen and most fitness activities will be allowed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased that shops will be able to remain open in Worcester from the 2nd of December, especially coming into Christmas and going forward our testing capacity and start to roll out the vaccines as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>“I know the coming weeks are going to be difficult, but we need to do whatever we can by supporting our local businesses and buying locally, whether that be in person or through click and collect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-35/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This week brought us the Chancellor’s Spending Review and it was disappointing in its lack of funding for Wales. The UK Government have repeatedly promised that Wales would not be worse off outside the EU, but the Shared Prosperity Fund investment falls far short of what we would have received from the EU Structural and Investment Funds and will have serious implications for our businesses, communities, and people across Wales who are struggling after a decade of austerity and in addition the significant effects of the Covid pandemic. There was also no mention of the promised support to help with the recovery from the flooding that hit parts of South Wales in February and funding for the maintenance of coal tips, which come under UK Government responsibilities. The UK Government must respect the devolution settlement and provide the funding which Wales requires for the economy to recover and contribute to the health and wellbeing of the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
<p>The Chancellor has also betrayed our key workers – those who have looked after us during this crisis – by giving them a real terms pay cut.  This will not help the economy recover as hard-working people will have to tighten their belts even further as prices continue to rise. He also continued with the inhumane plans to cut Universal Credit, despite a tacit recognition that the original level was not enough to live off as it was raised to support people during the crisis.   And with Brexit just around the corner there was no clarity in levels of preparation which will further impact people’s ability to spend on our high streets and support businesses to recover. The Chancellor is making all the wrong decisions: we need investment, not tax hikes and pay cuts.</p>
<p>My duties in Westminster last week included a number of commitments as a member of the Panel of Chairs. On Tuesday I chaired the Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee. This statutory instrument ensured that the U.K. can continue to utilise electronic passport gates (e-Gates) to process the arrival of citizens of current EU and EEA member states, and Switzerland, entering the UK as visitors after the end of the transition period on 31st December 2020. This SI also allows for leave to be granted to those who enter through an e-Gate and qualify for status under the S2 Healthcare Visitor cohort, and provides for Service Providers from Switzerland to use multi-agency visas. These rights to enter the UK are protected by the Withdrawal Agreement, the EFTA Separation Agreement, and the Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement, and is important to maintain security and fluidity across the UK border, and forms part of the UK Government’s long term plans to develop a new global border and immigration system that will be digital by default.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I chaired the Bill Committee for Laura Trott’s Private Member’s Botulinum Toxin and Cosmetic Fillers (Children) Bill. Laura’s Bill has cross party support because so many children have received unregulated treatment which has caused serious, and often life lasting, physical and mental harm. The Bill makes it an offence for a person, business owner and body corporate to administer botulinum toxin and other filler substances to a child (under 18) to be injected for cosmetic purposes, which alter the appearance of the child who has been injected. The committee comprehensively discussed and unanimously passed all the clauses in the Bill, unamended. The Bill will now be subjected to a similar procedure in the House of Lords, and if passed, will return to the Commons for Royal Assent.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I chaired the International Development and Gender-Based Violence debate in Westminster Hall. This was a very emotive debate in which members discussed how the coronavirus pandemic has raised awareness of the gender-based violence that is occurring in countries all over the world. The UN has estimated that in the 12 months before the pandemic, 242 million women and girls were subjected to sexual or physical violence, and that these numbers will drastically increase during the pandemic. Members spoke about the heart breaking experiences of women and girls in their constituencies and there was agreement across Westminster Hall that whilst every country is grappling with the pandemic, our commitment to end violence, exploitation and abuse targeted at women and girls must not be diminished.</p>
<p>I was pleased this week to attend the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Immigration Law and Policy held in partnership with the Unity Project regarding no recourse to public funds. No recourse to public funds has been in the news recently in connection with the Domestic Abuse Bill and awareness of the policy has grown during the pandemic. No recourse to public funds is a particularly pernicious policy for those facing domestic abuse and who are further exposed to exploitation and abuse with threats of being thrown out of the country. Many campaigners have argued that no recourse to public funds is unnecessarily cruel and is inconsistent with our fight to stop domestic abuse, to reduce inequality, to reduce homelessness, and to prevent exploitation. We have to accept that this policy is exacerbating many problems that then end up costing the Government (and therefore the taxpayer) even more money. But the human element is also important. This policy is pushing people in hardship into dangerous situations, and into psychological and physical trauma. We must find an alternative.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any matters that fall under my work as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/2020/11/26/amber-valley-derbyshire-tier-update-from-the-2nd-december-2020/"><![CDATA[<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

    <title>CADEY committee meets for update on campaign to boost lifesaving defibrillators</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.grahamstuart.com/2020/11/cadey-committee-meets-for-update-on-campaign-to-boost-lifesaving-defibrillators/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The CADEY committee, chaired by Beverley and Holderness MP Graham Stuart, has met virtually for an update on its campaign to increase the number of lifesaving defibrillators across the constituency.</p>
<p>Formed in 2018, CADEY – standing for Community Access Defibrillators East Yorkshire – identified 63 communities without a publicly accessible defibrillator when it was formed. This has since been reduced by more than half by offering match-funding schemes with parish councils, as well as by asking businesses to use community funds to help purchase them.</p>
<p>The committee’s latest meeting on 20th November brought Graham together with representatives from the Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) as well as health and welfare charities the HEY Smile Foundation, Help for Health and NURSE.</p>
<p>With the help of 50% match-funding from NURSE, six new defibrillators are due to be installed in the coming weeks and months, including in South Dalton and Mappleton, while publicly accessible defibrillators in Kilnsea and Rise have now been added to the YAS database so they are able to direct patients to them in an emergency.</p>
<p>Graham said, “So many cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals – 30,000 a year – and only one in every ten people survive. There’s no magic bullet of course, but raising awareness of the importance of CPR and defibrillators can make a massive difference because every minute without treatment reduces someone’s chances of survival by 10%.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted as well that we’ve seen CPR training added to the national curriculum, because some other countries which teach it regularly have almost twice the survival rates.</p>
<p>“Knowing where your nearest defibrillator is and being confident to use it are two simple steps that can save lives.”</p>
<p>Leading charities have raised concerns that survival rates could be getting worse after one-third of British adults said that they didn’t know whether they should be giving CPR during the pandemic, or if it has to be performed by trained clinicians in suitable PPE. Official guidance from the Resuscitation Council recommends placing loose material over the patient’s mouth and nose before performing hands-only CPR.</p>
<p>The CADEY committee is also working up plans to send postcards across Beverley and Holderness, with information about what to do in case of emergency alongside the location of the closest available defibrillator. The committee will be encouraging people to stick these on their fridge, so the information is close to hand in an emergency.</p>
<p>The postcards will also invite people to download the free what3words app, which has given every 3-metre square in the world a unique combination of words. Their system is already used by YAS to quickly identify where to go on call-outs and giving YAS the three words corresponding to your exact location can save paramedics vital minutes to help in the fight to save lives.</p>
<p>The postcards will feature space for people to write in the what3words corresponding to their home address, so that YAS know exactly where to head to and can tell the caller where their closest defibrillator is.</p>

    <title>Isles MP backs staff call to prevent Remote Air Traffic Control</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Isles MP Angus MacNeil is backing calls by Prospect Union to protect island jobs by opposing the centralisation of Air Traffic Control functions to Inverness.</p>



<p>Prospect members in Air Traffic Control at Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) are to be balloted on industrial action over HIAL’s plans to push on with its remote towers project.</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “This is an inevitable consequence of HIAL’s high handed approach to people’s jobs and livelihoods and damaging the island economy by taking critical, well paid jobs out of the area.  It is time now for the Scottish Government to step in.</p>



<p>“HIAL’s answers have not been good enough. Air Traffic Control staff and the public deserve better. The Transport Minister needs to get involved and our Air Traffic Control services need to be kept in Benbecula and Stornoway.”</p>



<p>Prospect have stressed that any industrial action will have no effect on emergency services and if action is taken it will be after the Christmas holiday period.</p>

    <title>Letter from Cllr David Mellen to the PM on COVID Tiers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2020/11/25/letter-from-cllr-david-mellen-to-the-pm-on-covid-tiers/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;Cllr David Mellen&lt;br&gt;Leader, Nottingham City Council&lt;/p&gt;

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>As we approach the halfway point of the Government’s nationwide lockdown, I want to thank constituents and businesses for abiding by the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The Government has lost control of the virus, and my first duty is to keep my constituents safe. That is why I voted for the lockdown. Nobody voted for the regulations with anything but a heavy heart. I did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>This period must be used to undertake the transfer of test and trace to local public health departments, including a full resource transfer. In addition, the Government must ensure that the NHS and social care are fully prepared with adequate PPE, as high as possible uptake of flu vaccinations and regular testing regimes.</p>
<p>I have proposed measures to protect the clinically vulnerable and providing ‘supportive shielding’ so that people don’t experience the devastating isolation that happened last time. We must also make sure we have simple, coherent messaging with local community engagement as well as monitoring and enforcement capacity to support people complying during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Local restrictions have had a devastating effect on people living in care homes and their families.  As co-Chair of the APPG on Dementia I have received heart-breaking stories from Oldhamers, unable to visit their loved ones for months on end, and who have seen a marked deterioration in their condition, particularly for those living with dementia.</p>
<p>I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the impact of coronavirus on people living with dementia, their families and carers last week, where I challenged the Minister on these issues. I pressed the Minister to report back to Parliament on her trial of visitor testing which starts on 16<sup>th</sup> November in 30 care homes, with the intention of rolling out testing for visitors across the country in December.  It is essential that family members are able to safely visit their loved ones in care homes, especially as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>I have also been challenging the Government on how they’ve been awarding Covid-related contracts. Billions of pounds of public money has been awarded to private companies often with no experience in delivering medical supplies. The Government’s repeated refusal to come clean about where this public money has left no option but to compel the Government to come clean through the courts. This is why I partnered with Caroline Lucas MP, Layla Moran MP and the Good Law Project in legal action to force the Government to publish details of private covid and PPE related contracts.</p>
<p>Whilst we recognise that at the beginning of the pandemic we needed to move quickly, this does not justify the Government’s wholesale disregard for transparency including the publication of contracts awarded. The Government has now disclosed that at least £17 billion worth of Covid-19 contracts have been awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care since April, with over £4 billion of these contracts being hidden. The transparency gap is therefore growing.</p>
<p>I am pleased that last week the High Court granted our judicial review to challenge the Government’s persistent failure to publish these contracts. The hearing is scheduled for mid-January 2021 and I’ll keep you informed of our progress.</p>
<p>Do look after yourselves and stay safe.</p>

    <title>Emma Joins Advisory Board of the John Mills Institute for Prosperity</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color"&gt;Earlier this month I was delighted to be personally invited by renowned businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist, John Mills to join the advisory board of his new Institute for Prosperity recently. The nine person advisory board is made up of a group of cross-party MPs, former MPs and Peers. All of whom have Ministerial or Shadow Ministerial experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Institute was set up earlier this year by Mr Mills who is also the founder and Chairman of South Shields based consumer goods company JML, which sells high-volume consumer products in the UK and 85 countries worldwide.&amp;nbsp;The Institute’s aim is to increase prosperity, growth and equality by putting a more successful economic future at the heart of British political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Shields, like many towns across the country have been decimated by lack of investment and deindustrialisation and many have been forgotten by successive governments. Growing up I watched this powerful and prosperous industrious town slowly wither and as a result 100’s of skilled jobs, like that of my fathers disappeared too along with much needed investment. So, I am delighted to work alongside John and parliamentary colleagues to do all we can to find a consensus, to provide a platform to bring people with fresh ideas together and to find new solutions to Britain’s economic problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith tells Government ‘the people of the north will hold you to account’ on rebalancing the economy.</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I took part in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DanJarvisMP&lt;/a&gt; debate on support for the economy in the North. We need a fundamental rebalancing of our economy after Covid. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this Government to account for their promises and their actions. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCcp6jNBhp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCcp6jNBhp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judith Cummins (@JudithCummins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudithCummins/status/1326541226452004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today in Parliament I pressed the Health Secretary Matt Hancock for answers on how the roll-out of an approved COVID-19 vaccine is likely to affect our lives and when it might be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP and Ex-RAF Serviceman Steve McNamara Remark on Remembrance Sunday 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional remembrance memorial services have halted by the coronavirus pandemic, preventing gatherings around memorials and cenotaphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps believes that this should not lessen our commitment to remembering those who have died in war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting the Hatfield Memorial Garden, Mr Shapps said: “Today cuts very deep inside really because it makes you recall…the ultimate sacrifice that so many have given to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so easy to forget what they went through- the horror of it all- so that we could live in peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve McNamara, an RAF veteran from Welwyn Garden City with grandfathers who fought in both First and Second World Wars, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think every generation has historic, cataclysmic events that define them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this generation, it is probably COVID. It has produced heroes and victims, and I think these will be remembered in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps also spoke of the vital role of the Armed Forces in the battle against the virus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a Remembrance Sunday like no other, as we battle this coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the thing to remember is that a lot of the people that we’re here commemorating and thanking, are actually out there serving right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thousands internationally, but also at home in the battle against the virus- for example in Liverpool, helping with mass-testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps laid a wreath at the Hatfield memorial. He said: “I think in the Armed Forces we have as much to thank today as we ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why Remembrance Sunday- even remembering it slightly differently than usual is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video of the visit was produced, which you can view below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Financial support for those in the North</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2020/11/04/financial-support-for-those-in-the-north/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It could not be more clear that the North is being treated completely differently to the South. I took the opportunity yesterday to question the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, about what financial support package would be available to businesses and workers going forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior to this lockdown announcement, we had had almost universal calls for an extension to the full furlough scheme in areas with tighter restrictions, which Ministers had rejected for months. Despite that, the Government saw fit to announce a new version of this on Saturday, only hours before the previous furlough was due to be replaced by an inferior scheme for us in the north, as further restrictions were becoming inevitable in many areas. Many people in the north therefore now believe that until workers in the south were to be affected by the national lockdown, they were somehow thought to be worth less. Businesses in Gateshead and elsewhere are desperate for clarity and certainty to help them in planning and so that they know whether and how they can survive. Will the Chief Secretary commit today to publishing details of a comprehensive, ongoing financial support package available to businesses and their workers in areas that will continue to need it, where tiers of restrictions might, sadly, have to continue after 2 December?</p></blockquote>
<p>The full debate can be found at: <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-03a.162.0&amp;s=ian+mearns#g174.0">https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-03a.162.0&amp;s=ian+mearns#g174.0</a></p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>This month sees the end of the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, which was put in place at the start of lockdown to avoid mass job losses. It leaves many people in Bristol South facing a very uncertain future.</p>
<p>I, and my Labour colleagues, have been pushing to see the scheme extended for those hardest hit sectors which are still unable to operate properly due to ongoing restrictions. Disappointingly, the Government chose to ignore the calls from us, from business owners, trade unions, think tanks, the cross-party Treasury Select Committee and some of its own MPs; in doing so, it has let down hundreds of thousands of people working in vulnerable industries such as hospitality, leisure, travel and the arts.</p>
<p>Bristol South does not have lots of large employers which can accommodate mass remote working set up. Families across Bristol South rely on paid work with Bristol Airport and in cafes, bars and restaurants as well as the creative sector. It’s home to lots of small businesses, many of which were struggling before the pandemic hit and this has made things a hundred times harder. I’ve heard from local business owners and self-employed people with heartbreaking stories of their family business, in the community for decades employing local people, suddenly facing financial ruin and closure as a result of this pandemic.</p>
<p>The percentage of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Bristol South has already risen from 3.6% in March to 6.2% this summer, and this is likely to increase further. I’m hearing from lots of people who’ve always worked and have never had to apply for government support before. And it’s hitting women and young people particularly hard. We must act now to avert the biggest jobs crisis of a generation.</p>
<p>The Government announced the launch of a Kickstart scheme to support younger jobseekers in August, but we’re yet to see this in action and there appears to be no job guarantee at the end of it. I welcome the offer of extra paid incentives for businesses taking on new apprentices and would encourage employers in Bristol South to explore this further, but they too will need jobs at the end of their training and, at the moment, there is no guarantee there either.</p>
<p>This piecemeal approach is not enough. We need a national plan for job retention and creation as well as retraining. I will continue lobbying the Government on this and am working on plans for my 2021 jobs and apprenticeships fair to help link local people up with jobs and training opportunities. In the meantime, there is help available locally to support people with job hunting and employability skills, see <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/16/support-for-employers-and-jobseekers/"><strong>here</strong></a> for more details.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/28/opinion-karin-smyth-mp-on-a-rise-in-unemployment-in-bristol-south/" target="_blank">OPINION: Karin Smyth MP on a rise in unemployment in Bristol South</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Garforth Station – step free access ready for planning permission.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.alecshelbrooke.co.uk/garforth-railway-station-step-free-access-ready-planning-permission/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Network Rail is preparing the final stages of delivering step-free access at Garforth Railway Station, it has been announced. </p>
<p>Alec had been campaigning for new step-free access at Garforth for over a decade before finally securing funds direct from the Department for Transport. Alec will continue to work closely, cross-party, with Garforth’s Independent Councillors to represent the views of residents through the planning process. </p>
<p>Announcing the scheme in 2014, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “After years of false starts and broken promises under Labour, it is a testament to the local Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke’s persistent campaigning that I can announce that this scheme is finally happening for the people of Garforth”.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Alec has been in regular contact with Transport officials pushing for firmer plans and no further delays. He also raised the matter several times in the House of Commons Chamber. </p>
<p>But today it has been announced that the final stage before construction is now underway.</p>
<p>Alec said: “Today I’m delighted that Network Rail has formalised a plan with four options for stakeholders to choose from before the submission of a full planning application to Leeds City Council. It is my hope that Leeds City Council can deal with the application swiftly to avoid no further delays”.</p>
<p>“I have been campaigning for step-free access at Garforth Station for many years. We had an original plan submitted but this then incurred unnecessary delays along the way but I have been committed to providing disabled people and pushchair users with the same access to travel as everyone else – and delivering step-free access at Garforth station will help thousands more people travel easily and without additional cost, time or stress”.</p>
<p>Previously, Garforth resident Mrs Morris said: “We’ve waited far too long for disabled access at Garforth. The elderly, disabled and those with pushchairs have not been able to use the station so we’re extremely grateful to Alec for fighting alongside us to deliver this disabled access”. </p>
<p>The Government’s Access for All programme was first launched in 2006 and has delivered more than 200 accessible routes into selected stations so far.</p>
<p>A further 1,500 stations have received smaller scale improvements such as accessible toilets, platform humps to reduce stepping distances and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment.</p>
