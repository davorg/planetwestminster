<p><span><span><span>As part of my ongoing efforts to offer support to those affected, I am pleased to report that I have today co-signed a letter to HMRC with parliamentary colleagues.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Together, we have asked for a series of assurances from HMRC with regards to the process for reclaiming the monies owed and made clear our belief that, as yet, they have not yet offered the understanding and flexibility in relation to repayments that they had previously promised to those affected (so that they can realistically repay the monies owed).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We have also requested clarification as to the possible implications that investigations into Apostle Accounting’s activities could have on our constituents’ cases. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to follow this developing case closely, working with fellow parliamentarians to provide support for those affected and to ensure that HMRC strengthen their systems in order to try and prevent such situations in future. </span></span></span></p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Reacting to the Government’s announcement today that new laws will end the cap on civil penalties for environmental offences, Environmental Audit Committee Chairman, Rt Hon Philip Dunne MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> “The EAC has been calling for some time for toughening sanctions and ensuring the polluter pay principle is enforced, and that where fines are imposed they should be used to help improve water quality in the catchment affected. Those responsible for polluting England’s precious waterways must be held to account. Pollution in rivers and seas devastate wildlife and can severely impact public health to recreational users.</p>

<p> “So I am pleased the Government is upping the ante today, both by enabling unlimited fines for the most egregious pollution events, and ensuring that the proceeds of these fines are ring-fenced into Water Restoration Funds which will be invested to help improve water quality.</p>

<p> “While this announcement comes at a time when the finances of numerous water companies is under the spotlight, we received confirmation today from Ofwat that households bills cannot be affected from fines imposed on water companies.</p>

<p> “I hope today’s announcement further incentivises water and sewerage companies to get their houses in order, invest in infrastructure to upgrade our Victorian era system and help cut sewage discharges into our waterways.” </p>

<p>The minister agreed to set up a meeting with the Department for Transport and Westmorland and Furness Council to discuss bringing more services to rural communities.</p>
<p>Speaking after the meeting, Tim said: <em>"I'm really grateful to the minister for his time this afternoon.</em></p>
<p><em>"Having regular and affordable bus services is absolutely vital in helping connect our rural communities, supporting local businesses and reducing our carbon emissions.</em></p>
<p><em>"But sadly with the W1 and 530 services under serious threat, it feels like a real uphill battle at the moment.</em></p>
<p><em>"That's why the new Westmorland and Furness Council are seeking more funding to support bus services to help our communities thrive."</em></p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP shares continued frustration that unemployment figures aren’t improving in the area</title>

<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has reacted to this week’s unemployment figures with frustration as they demonstrate the Tory Government has not got a grip of the fragile economy.</p>
<p>Figures released this week show that there has been a 4% increase in 16-64 year-olds who are unemployed within the Bristol South constituency between the months of May to June 2023. With 2,775 people seeking unemployment support in this age bracket, it represents a 25% increase since March 2020.</p>
<p>Looking at the youth unemployment figures; the data shows a 6% monthly change between May and June 2023 with 525 people between the ages of 18-24 years-old seeking support. When you compare figures from before the pandemic (March 2020), youth unemployment in Bristol South has increased 17%.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“The underlying fragilities in our economy are not being fixed by the Tory Government. Since the pandemic they have spent more time arguing amongst themselves instead of trying to fix our low-growth, high-inflation economy. My frustration at their inability to get a grip is only matched by my determination to secure a Labour Government which can fix this mess.</p>
<p>“Although these figures focus on those seeking unemployment support, we know that those in work are struggling more than ever before. Wages have increased at their slowest pace on modern record, inflation remains stuck near 9% and mortgage rates are rocketing. The Prime Minister may spend his time hiding away from scrutiny, but he was Chancellor before becoming PM and the buck stops with him.</p>
<p>“The next Labour Government has no time to waste. We will tackle the Tory Mortgage Bombshell by bringing banks and lenders together to implement a five-point action plan. We will drive investment in green industries to secure long-term economic growth and most importantly we will deliver an apprenticeships system that works for young people and employers.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/07/12/karin-smyth-mp-shares-continued-frustration-that-unemployment-figures-arent-improving-in-the-area/">Karin Smyth MP shares continued frustration that unemployment figures aren’t improving in the area</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>The Treasury and Bank get it wrong again   Conservative Home article</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2023/07/12/the-treasury-and-bank-get-it-wrong-again-conservative-home-article/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div contenteditable="true">
<div dir="auto">
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr"> In the closing years of the Thatcher/Major Conservative governments Ministers accepted dreadful advice from the Bank of England and Treasury. They based UK economic policy on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. I wrote a pamphlet, made speeches, lobbied Ministers not to do this pointing out it would lead to high inflation or recession.  One Cabinet Minister agreed with me and a few economists and commentators. Labour, the CBI and  TUC agreed with the officials. They had their way, caused a big inflation, then gave us a savage recession  to correct the first error. Conservatives plunged to around 30% in the polls when the damage of the policy became clear and stayed there until the election which resulted in the loss of 178 seats.</div>
<div dir="ltr"/>
<div dir="ltr">         The present government is too trusting of current Bank/ Treasury advice. It has given them high inflation. The Bank has blamed the Ukraine war impact on energy and food prices yet Switzerland, China and Japan avoided such a result despite sharing the same world inflation pressures. The UK inflation rate was already 275% over target before the war. Now the Bank threatens to make the opposite mistake and cause a recession. It ignored the advice I and some others offered not to print so much money in 2021 and buy so many bonds at crazily high prices. It now wants to undermine the bond market further with large sales of bonds at ever lower prices.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">           It is vital that before Parliament breaks up for a long summer recess the Chancellor changes economic policy and the Bank of England produces the results of its review of its economic model and forecasts. The country needs and deserves a better policy. There are ways to bring inflation down faster and grow the economy more. We need to lift more people out of real income hits and  low spending power through better paid jobs. The Conservative party also needs to be more competitive, to avoid a Labour government which would make the economy worse and would double down on policy tendencies that are creating inflation and slow growth. The danger is  that people, disappointed with the last couple of years of economic performance, vote to impose a worse approach on themselves in frustration.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">        The Bank of England has wisely and bravely admitted that it has been getting inflation forecasts horribly wrong. It admits its current model of the economy does not work and has said it now ignores most of what its model says. This is dangerous. The whole purpose of the Monetary Policy Committee is to forecast inflation, then to adjust policy to keep it around 2% in the light of the forecast. Two and three years ago the Bank was confidently forecasting inflation would stay around 2%. It soared to over 11%, way outside acceptable margins of error in what is a difficult task. The MPC cannot have a clear take on what to do all the time it cannot define the extent of the inflationary problem ahead. The Treasury and the Treasury Committee of Parliament should urge the Bank to make early changes to their model. They need to back test the new model and change it sufficiently so it can forecast what has happened . Then we might have a model that the Bank can rely on more when charting the future. I doubt they can get a model to work without including a   bigger role for money and credit, which they currently ignore in their MPC publications. We have a Money Policy Committee that does not do money.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">       The Bank should study the Peoples Bank of China’s critique of the Federal Reserve Board of the USA which made similar mistakes to the Bank of England for similar reasons. China currently has inflation at 0.2% and did not experience an inflation overrun from world oil and food prices surging over the Ukraine war. China  criticises the over expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. There is now a danger that the Fed and the Bank of England over contract their balance sheet as they try to correct past mistakes. In doing so the Fed helped bring down some regional banks. The Bank of England helped bring down the highly leveraged Liability Driven Investment bond funds, including the large holding in its own pension fund. Both Central Banks stopped the damage spreading by creating more money to offset the big sales of bonds they were undertaking to drive up interest rates.</div>
<div class="x_elementToProof"/>
<div class="x_elementToProof">       If the Bank sells fewer bonds the Treasury will be spared some huge losses. They should stop shrinking their balance sheet so much before something other than LDI funds breaks.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div class="x_elementToProof">The Treasury has set itself against any tax cuts on the grounds they would increase the deficit and therefore inflation. Meanwhile the Treasury approves many new increases in spending both for new programmes and to compensate for inflation of costs and poor productivity in many parts of the public sector. Inflationary increases in public spending are clearly generally inflationary. The CPI is now powered upwards by service sector inflation. The Treasury needs to be encouraging higher pay for higher output, with  something for something public sector pay deals . It needs to put a stop on more recruiting ither than  front line and uniformed staff into the public sector, promoting and streamlining from within. NHS England has recruited an extra 3500 managers this Parliament to supervise a big fall in productivity. This has to be reversed.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>There are tax cuts that do not lead to tax revenue losses, as Ireland shows us. Their Corporation tax rate half the UK’s produces four times as much revenue per head as the UK rate. We need a supply side revolution, with business expansion and more investment in extra capacity. Lift IR 35 from the self employed. Raise the VAT threshold for small business. These  measures will boost output. Suspend VAT on fuel  and see inflation fall. Take carbon taxes off high energy using firms to avoid closures and relieve cost pressures.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>A new economic policy needs to rely on selective tax cuts and supply side measures to bring inflation down, and on driving a productivity catch up or recovery in public services to help bring state borrowing down. The Bank hitting mortgage holders ever harder to reduce their spending will not cure inflation, With government pressing for savers to get more interest their demand can rise as their children’s demand falls as a result of the mortgage squeeze.</div>

    <title>SPEECH: NATO SUMMIT IN VILNIUS (2023)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://martindocherty.scot/2023/07/11/speech-nato-summit-in-vilnius-2023/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin spoke in the Westminster Hall Debate on the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and NATO Summit 2023 in Vilnius. Here is an extract of his speech transcribed via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-07-06/debates/4F6A80FB-F46D-4ED4-ADEE-D590C9E17F0E/details"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hansard&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Docherty-Hughes MP (SNP, West Dunbartonshire): &lt;/strong&gt;As someone who spent a brief time on the NATO PA and longer on the Defence Committee, I am no stranger to these debates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issues of the High North and the north Atlantic were a constant litany from me when I was on the Committee, which I am sure the right hon. Members for North Durham (Mr Jones) and for Warley (John Spellar) were too aware of. One issue that I constantly raised was the north Atlantic command. It sadly did not come to the UK; it went to Norfolk in the United States, but it was welcome to see that gap being filled after some substantial time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As ever in such debates, there is an unusual amount of agreement from all sides. I hope to continue in that spirit. Any illusion we had of living on a peaceful continent has been shattered. The conference itself is an ideal moment for us to reiterate the commitment to ensuring that Ukraine specifically has whatever economic and military aid it needs, not only to repel the Russian invasion but to restore its pre-2014 boundaries. We know that one calculation that President Putin made when proceeding with his disastrous strategy was that Europe and the western allies were too divided to really care about Ukraine and its people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I am glad to say that he not only has been proven spectacularly wrong in that regard, but he has spurred such a precipitous move away from economic dependence on Russia that with each passing day he loses the ability to divide our societies in the way he once did. Just as it will be no surprise to all those here today who have heard me opine on Ukraine over the years, so it should be no surprise to those watching the debate from the Russian embassy that although there may be innumerable subjects on which this House does not unanimously agree, this is certainly not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that we will be hoping to see at the summit— I hope that Members agree—is a move towards some sort of NATO membership action plan for Ukraine. Obviously, the same caveats apply as we might see elsewhere, but a direction of travel, I think, must be established. When talking about these scenarios, it is always, of course, article 5 that is given the most attention. I think that the right hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell mentioned it in his opening speech, but in Ukraine’s case we can clearly hope to proceed with aid and mutual assurance along the lines of articles 2 and 3. Article 2 refers to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 3 states that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the Parties, separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are moving well along the track of article 3 without necessarily acknowledging it, but we will not achieve anything if we do not ensure that Ukrainian civil society and the country’s institutions receive just as much attention as the deliveries of Storm Shadow missiles. I hope, therefore, that last month’s conference here in this city will become an annual event even after Crimea is liberated from the clutches of Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the strengthening of free institutions among our NATO allies is of course the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I am glad that it is getting the recognition that it deserves in the debate today. Multilateral institutions like NATO can often be disparaged; I think that the right hon. Member for Warley alluded to that. They can be disparaged as “parasitic or pointless”, to quote Anne Applebaum’s excellent profile of the Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, in the latest edition of The Atlantic magazine. What the Parliamentary Assembly does is bring the democracies that constitute the alliance, however messy and imperfect they may be, to the leading edge of what makes NATO important and of its strength. I think that, far from its democratic nature being a drag, events such as the invasion have demonstrated how, although autocracies may notionally be able to move quicker, NATO is, to quote Applebaum’s article again, one of the “force multipliers that function better than the autocracies run by strongmen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is because when NATO and similar multilateral institutions make a decision, they tend to stick to it. The other democratic aspect of NATO that we often overlook is the fact that it is a consensus organisation: Iceland and the recent member, Montenegro, have as much say on the North Atlantic Council as the United States or, indeed, the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Iceland and Montenegro have as much say in the North Atlantic Council as the United States or the UK—this is where I might disagree with some Members, because whenever I hear committed Brexiteers waxing lyrical about NATO membership, I am always tempted to ask if they would not prefer to have the qualified majority voting of the EU. The consensus approach makes the choice of a Secretary-General so fraught and unpredictable, which is why someone who has proven to be such a reliable leader of the alliance will continue to be the best choice going forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am of course biased in favour of a social democratic politician from an unequivocally non-nuclear northern European state who can lead NATO with such understated authority. That is precisely the sort of multilateralism that my party and I like to see. We are not alone, however. The Secretary-General is expected to be confirmed in post for at least another year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I will take a brief moment to break from the consensus, in particular on the recent speculation about the Secretary of State for Defence, the right hon. and gallant Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace), being put forward for the Secretary-General role—I have ensured that he knows I am naming him, albeit in a good fashion. Being someone who has come up against him and his predecessors at first hand, I can certainly say that the Secretary of State stands head and shoulders above them as a man who has not shrunk from the myriad challenges in his Department. Although I may not have always agreed with him, he has played mainly with a straight bat when dealing with Parliament and with No. 10, who I am sure do not consider him to be one of the nodding dogs that they prefer to fill the Cabinet with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we were reminded just last week, the Secretary of State is the most popular Cabinet Minister among the Tory rank and file, a man who had to fend off nominations to be Prime Minister. Anyone behind a campaign that had between zero and heehaw’s chance in succeeding deserves a court martial at the very least. That is not because the Secretary of State is unsuitable—not at all—but because this is a critical moment for the issue of NATO and the EU, and there is no chance that a UK candidate could hope to succeed at this time. That is important to the overall debate about the role of the Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I read the Telegraph’s so-called exclusive this week that the White House would prefer to have the President of the European Commission succeed Secretary-General Stoltenberg, but it was hardly the shock that some people think, especially given the current US presidential Administration. I therefore make one slightly discordant plea not to put us through this every year: states that cannot—some would say—unequivocally support the twin pillars of European-Atlantic security will never find consensus behind them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before I get accused of being simply a petty Scottish nationalist, I have to say that that is a fact that not only the UK, but France and Germany may have to get used to as well. In various ways, each of the largest European states has demonstrated that in different ways, but they cannot rely on the weight of the past, especially with both the EU and NATO having expanded so much. In this debate, we have inevitably focused on UK contributions to Ukraine, but often it has been the countries of central and eastern Europe that have done the heaviest lifting, not least Estonia, which has spent the largest amount of per capita GDP on bilateral aid. Let me declare a non-pecuniary interest as the co-chair of the all-party group on Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We in the Scottish National party believe—as do the Government of Ukraine—that the two pillars of European security are NATO and, for us at least, the EU. I am afraid that I am the only person who is able to be so unequivocal in my summing-up speech, although having to state that is pretty incredible. Let us wish, too, for tangible progress on the future of Ukrainian membership, along with a reiteration of the fact that our support for Ukraine will last longer than the Russian invasion with its heavy losses can—the Russians will continue to experience those until they leave Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the debate in full &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/c7b5cd1b-33c2-4ea1-88d7-bd646aac8713?in=15:11:06"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Isles MP Angus MacNeil is encouraged that Transport Scotland are now actively exploring the feasibility of a pilot scheme to retain ferry deck capacity for short-notice travel.</p>

<p>Mr MacNeil has been in contact with the Scottish Government calling for a staggered release of vehicle bookings which would improve access to ferries for all, including islands residents who need to travel at short notice.</p>



<p>Commenting on the response he received from the Transport Minister, Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased to hear that Calmac are working with Transport Scotland and island communities to investigate a pilot to hold back some vehicle deck capacity for short-notice travel.</p>



<p>“I have been suggesting that, regardless of where people come from, there be a staggered release of space on car decks. 70% in the beginning, then 20% the month before and the last 10% in the week before the sailing. This gives different types of travellers, regardless of where people live, the ability to make these bookings. It gives businesses and people who need to travel at short notice or attend hospital, the hope of being able to travel.”</p>



<p>As part of the Islands Connectivity Plan (ICP) alongside the wider Fair Fares Review, Transport Scotland will consider all issues raised around this proposal. Engagement and consultation will be central to the ICP and will provide the opportunity to ensure that the ferry policy addresses the needs of island residents, businesses, and communities.</p>

    <title>Statement on Boundary Changes and the Next General Election</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">Since being elected in 2015, it has been my absolute privilege to serve the diverse communities of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency. Therefore, today’s Boundary Commission announcement brings both personal sadness and a wider concern for our region.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The changes mean that at next year’s General Election, our region will only be represented by two constituencies, reduced from the current three, and that is bad news for us all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, the re-drawn boundaries mean that, regardless of the wishes of the voters at the ballot box, I will no longer represent some of the communities I hold dear in the next election.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While the plans to reduce representation without fully considering our region’s unique geography and distinct needs are disheartening, the Commission did see sense and made some changes from previous proposals. In that regard, I want to thank everyone who shared their views with the Boundary Commission.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our concerted campaigning means the communities of Culloden, Balloch, and Smithton have been returned to the Inverness constituency where they rightfully belong, and new constituency titles now rightly include other communities such as Skye, Nairn, and Strathspey.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to the opportunity to continue serving the City of Inverness, Aird &amp; Loch Ness and other neighbouring communities while establishing new friendships with the residents of Skye, Fort William and Wester Ross communities as I seek to represent their distinct needs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the challenges these changes bring, I remain dedicated to serving all our communities. Your voices and your needs are at the heart of my work and, together with my SNP colleagues, I will continue to strive for the very best outcomes for our communities.</p>

<p>There’s no getting around the fact that we find ourselves living in turbulent times, and that globally, we face several unique challenges.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has seen war break out in Europe for the first time since 1945, the climate crisis poses an existential threat to our way of life, and the development of sophisticated cyber technology continues to test the limits of Governments across the world.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about these issues over the last few days. If you follow me on social media you might have seen that, since Thursday, I’ve been at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Seminar in Vancouver.</p>
<p>With roots stretching back to the 1970s, the OSCE was formed with the intention of inviting collaboration between nations on key issues relating to Global Security. Back in 2020, I was appointed to the UK delegation to the OSCE, meaning I’m expected to represent the UK at OSCE global conferences when they take place.</p>
<p>Global security might seem detached from day-to-day life here in Tameside, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>We live in an interconnected world, where what happens on one side of the world can have lasting implications of the other. Take Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine as a prime example.</p>
<p>Not only have we seen millions of Ukrainians displaced from their home and forced to seek refuge in other nations (not least of all in the UK, where Tamesiders have stepped up to support our Ukrainian friends), but we’ve also seen wider impacts on product supply chains and domestic energy prices.</p>
<p>It’s really important, then, that the UK does everything it can to engage with its friends, neighbours and allies on the global stage to ensure that we all work towards a progressive, safer world. That means standing up against bullies and tyrants like Putin and protecting fundamental values like democracy, liberty and the right to self-determination.</p>
<p>With everything that is happening, it can sometimes feel like the world is stacked against peace and prosperity. However, when I feel despondent, I’m always reminded of Martin Luther King Jr’s famous quote that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice”. In other words, positive change does eventually happen, it just takes time.</p>
<p>The challenges I identified at the start of this piece are impossible to solve on our own. We need to see a global effort to address them, with every country doing their bit to make a difference. I’m proud to be playing a small part on behalf of the people I represent here in Tameside.</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-96/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">My week in Westminster began at the Barnardo’s <em>Journeys of Hope</em> event held as part of Refugee’s Week, where I was honoured to meet some very brave unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and some young people supported by Barnardo’s. The event also launched Barnardo’s “<a href="https://www.barnardos.org.uk/warm-welcome">A Warm Welcome</a>” report which sets out key recommendations for UK Government to establish a fair and welcoming movement for all children, regardless of nationality. Barnardo’s staff told me they are very concerned that the UK Government’s Illegal Migration Bill will deny children the help and protection they desperately need because in its current form it would prevent children from putting forward their case for asylum in the UK, as well as disqualifying some groups of children who have been identified as victims of trafficking from receiving protection and support. In 2014, the UK Government rightly banned detention of children for longer than 24 hours and its deeply worrying that this Bill would reverse this by allowing children arriving alone or with their families to be detained for longer periods.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.arcouk.org/">Association of Retirement Community Operators</a> (ARCO) held an event to launch its manifesto “<a href="https://www.arcouk.org/press-release/arcos-manifesto-for-older-peoples-housing-an-irc-in-every-town">An IRC for the provision of Integrated Retirement Communities (IRCs) in the UK</a>”. ARCO is the principal body representing private and not-for-profit operators of housing with care schemes in the UK. An IRC sometimes referred to as “housing-with-care”, “assisted living”, or “extra-care”, and is specialised housing for older people, distinct and separate to both residential care homes, as well as traditional models of retirement housing such as “sheltered housing” with a visiting warden or manager. The key features of an IRC are: every resident has their own front door, kitchen, and bathroom; 24/7 online support; shared facilities including, lounges, restaurants, gyms, hairdressers, shops, leisure facilities; with the option to buy, rent, or social rent. IRCs are operated by charities, housing associations, and private companies. People are living longer than ever before, and need housing that improves their well-being, with access to services. ARCO maintains that IRCs would save the NHS and Social Care budget up to £1 billion per year and alleviate loneliness, and urges the UK Government to increase IRCs across the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I had the honour of meeting Andy, a survivor of suffering cardiac arrest, and Bernie, who had saved a person’s life who was having a cardiac arrest by administering CPR, at the Resuscitation Council UK (RCUK) drop-in at Westminster. RCUK want to raise awareness of the urgent need to have a recovery plan to ensure people who have a cardiac arrest get the follow-up care they urgently need. A cardiac arrest is the ultimate medical emergency when the heart stops beating, and the person is clinically dead. But cardiac arrest survivors are not offered the same well-established rehabilitation services that stroke and heart attack survivors receive. Andy told me that he and his family struggled with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, and there needs to be a consistent formal care pathway across the UK. I support the RCUK campaign “<a href="https://www.resus.org.uk/get-involved/my-right-cardiac-arrest-recovery">My Right to Cardiac Arrest Recovery</a>“.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended Unison’s and the RAC’s launch of their report “<a href="https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2022/11/mileage-rate-rise-needed-urgently-for-public-sector-staff/">Driven out of work: the impact of mileage rates on frontline public service workers</a>”, which highlights the effect of out-of-date rates and the cars they drive: one-in-five is required to drive to do their job; they are paid significantly lower average wages; drive significant distances and can be left thousands of pounds out of pocket; and many use food banks and take out loans. The report recommends that: the UK Government should increase mileage rates to 63.4p per mile; HMRC approved rates be restructured to remove the 10,000 miles cap; urgent action on public sector pay and low wages so staff are not in a vulnerable situation; and investment in public sector electric vehicles.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met some wonderful hard working, dedicated members of the Prison Officers Association (POA) at their Parliamentary reception to launch their “<a href="https://www.poauk.org.uk/support/68-is-too-late/">68 is Too Late</a>” report. The POA has been concerned for many years about violence in our prison system and disagree with the UK Government’s view that prison officer grades along with operational support grades in public sector prisons should have their pension age linked to the state pension age, which will eventually rise to 68. The POA also call on the UK Government to hold a Royal Commission into our prisons and the whole criminal justice system, from probation to courts to policing. The POA want to partner with PCS, NAPO, Police Federation, Community, GMB, Unite, Howard League, Prison Transform Trust, and others to urge the UK Government to have a root and branch review into the state of the justice system. The campaign will be cross-party to make sure that a Royal Commission will be in their manifestos for the next General Election. The Conservative Party included it in its 2019 Manifesto but has failed to deliver so far. General Secretary of the POA, Steve Gillan, introduced the launch and Secretary General of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) Mick Whelan was the guest speaker.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was elected as a vice-chair at the AGM for the APPG Limits on Growth, which was followed by a briefing from MEP Philippe Lamberts on the impact of the <a href="https://www.beyond-growth-2023.eu/">Beyond Growth Conference</a> held last month in the EU Parliament. The conference was opened by EU President Ursula von der Leyen and presented a step change on political thinking on limits to growth. Philippe summarised the findings of the conference, and highlighted the appetite for post-growth thinking across politics and civil society, and the strength of the new youth movement campaigning for change. He spoke about EU green investment plans and how they compare with the Inflation Reduction Act in America.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.asdafoundation.org/">ASDA Foundation</a> event to highlight how Asda impacts on local communities through its 391 community champions who operate across the UK. They focus on local grass roots groups, and have a monthly goods donation budget which they use to support local good causes or help to fundraise. Over £550,000 was donated in 2022. And Asda Foundation awarded £750,000 to support 60 projects across the UK. Asda stores have food donation trollies to support food banks, food waste programmes which donated over 5 million meals in 2022. The champions organised litter picks, chatty cafes, and improved community well-being.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate secured by Dame Meg Hillier MP on <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-06-20/debates/8C2B8255-EEEB-4982-8A67-4C8FCBC62352/Co-OperativesAndAlternativeBusinessesLocalAuthoritySupport#contribution-33F8C2D7-2EC1-437E-A1DF-F353FA28F64A">the role of cooperatives in local authorities</a>. I paid tribute to the co-operators who have encouraged and supported me in my co-operative endeavours over the years – Alun Michael, former MP and PCC for South Wales; members of the Wales Co-operative Council, especially former secretary KC Gordon, who has recently stood down after over 20 years’ service; chair and former Wales MEP Cllr Jackie Jones; David Smith; who has campaigned for many years for the co-operative history of Robert Owen to be included in Welsh Curriculum; Karen Wilkie, former General Secretary of the Wales Co-operative Party, who worked to raise the profile of the Wales Co-operative Party for many years; and former MP Huw Irranca-Davies MS, who has campaigned with me for many years for a UK and Welsh Marcora Law, which gives workers the right and the financial support to buy out all or parts of an at-risk business and establish it as a worker-owned co-operative. Huw and I believe that the future of businesses would be greatly improved with a Marcora-type law. I commended <a href="https://cwmpas.coop/">Cwmpas</a>, formerly known as the Wales Co-operative Centre, for its work since 1982 to build a fairer, greener, economy and a more equal society where people and the planet come first. Cwmpas has been very successfully led by my friend Derek Walker for many years until he was recently appointed the Future Generations’ Commissioner. Cwmpas works with local authorities and other organisations to advise and support start-up businesses, and also provides ongoing support, recognising that this is an essential pilar of economic development in Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-20/debates/985E7922-AE41-48A6-B007-75F4BF0409C4/Finance(No2)Bill">Finance (No 2) Bill</a> remaining stages. Labour Amendment 1 reinstates the lifetime allowance charge on pensions by deleting clause 18, it was pushed to a vote, and was lost by 192-294 votes. Labour New Clause 7 requires the Chancellor to keep the House of Commons updated on progress implementing the OECD agreement on a global minimum corporate tax rate was voted on and was defeated by 202-296.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the APPG for Trade Justice I attended presentations by Dr McNamara and Dr Richardson on the consequences of the UK Government signing the CPTPP agreement next month in New Zealand. After which there will be several months in which the Trade and Agriculture Commission will report on the agreement followed by the GRaG period. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/381/bmj-2022-073302">Dr McNamara had some key messages about the implications of the CPTPP for health</a>, which needs urgent assessment: it contains many of the same provisions that made a potential US-UK free trade deal controversial for public health; it could increase industry influence in setting public health standards, making it more difficult for governments to regulate for health benefits, raise cost of medicines and generate economic insecurity and potential job losses; the UK Government has not conducted a health impact assessment so it needs to listen to public health scholars and professionals. Dr Richardson spoke about the context of the agreement regarding Labour Rights. Parties must: not derogate from or fail to enforce national Labour laws; discourage imports of goods made from forced law regardless of whether from a CPTPP country; maintain fundamental rights defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) as well as national minimum wages, working hours, and occupational health and safety; a Labour Council of government officials will report on implementation, oversee co-operative activities, and receive public submissions; and Parties can request a panel under the agreement’s Dispute Settlement chapter in event of non-compliance which can lead to compensation, fines, or suspension of benefits. The problems are: no external monitoring of compliance with Labour Chapter; government officials have discretion over response to public submissions; the route to dispute settlement process involves sustained government pressure on a CPTPP trade partner, challenging legal terrain, and potentially small economic disincentives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Baroness Maggie Jones to thank her again for taking my Shark Fins Bill through all the stages in the Lords on my behalf, and for an update on its final stage, Report Stage, on 16th June. Then hopefully it will receive its Royal Assent before Parliamentary recess on 20th July.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dwr Cymru held a Parliamentary event to promote its “<a href="http://dwrcymru.com/SupportWithBills">Here for You, Not for Profit</a>” cost of living support stakeholder pack, which sets out supporting the most vulnerable in society, because they don’t want any customers to worry about paying their bills. Dwr Cymru wants to raise awareness of its “Our Here for You” campaign, which helps people pay their bills through social tariffs, debt schemes, plus expert support and advice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Russia and Ukraine APPGs held a joint meeting with Evgenia Kara-Murza, the wife of Vladimir Kara-Murza, Russia’s second highest profile political prisoner and Bill Browder, who introduced and campaigned for the role of Magnitsky sanctions. Evgenia is a pro-democracy activist and has spoken across the world about her husband’s trial, and her activism against the Putin regime. Vladimir is an opposition politician, journalist, human rights activist, and a British Russian dual national. He was convicted for spreading knowingly false information about the Russian armed forces, involvement with an undesirable organisation and treason. He is serving 25 years in a Russian penal colony since April 2023 for this vocal opposition to Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine, which is the longest sentence to date for a Putin critic. Vladimir was poisoned in 2015 and 2019 in Moscow and was in a coma. He could not walk, talk, or feed himself because he’d had a stroke whilst in the coma. Evgenia nursed him back to health and she told us that unlike her husband she is not a politician and was happy working from home looking after their children, but she took up her husband’s work after his detention last year. She is calling on politicians not to let Putin win the war he caused against Ukraine, not force Ukraine to donate part of its territory to the Russia Federation, not allow him to behave like a bully. Tens of thousands of people are being arbitrarily detained in Russia and their stories must be heard. Evgenia said that the Kremlin has its hands full and don’t notice her going around the world campaigning for Vladimir, but she receives a lot of hatred on social media. If her husband survives and the Putin regime collapses, they will want to be part of building a new democratic Russia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.allwynentertainment.com/">Allwyn Entertainment Ltd</a> is the new operator for the National Lottery, and held a Westminster event so that parliamentarians could find out about its ambitions, values, and plans.  I met Anna Mellit, Director of Public Affairs, who told me that Allwyn aims to grow the National Lottery to be bigger, better, and safer, by implementing its social values of raising more money for good causes, and running its own business in an environmentally and socially-responsible manner. Allwyn plans to create new games that are more fun, better value, with more winners, build the best National Lottery team by integrating Camelot employees to take its vision forward, grow a strong supply UK chain, invest in IT, and enhance retail. Anna told me that they believe it’s a “Win for All”.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice chair of the APPG for MND, I attended the Global Motor Neuron Disease (MND) Awareness Day 2023. MND is a fatal, rapidly progressing neurological condition affecting more than 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. The disease causes messages from nerves (MD) in the brain and spinal cord that control movement to gradually stop reaching the muscles leading them to weaken, stiffen and waste away. People become locked in a failing body unable to move, talk, and eventually breathe. MND kills a third of people within a year of diagnosis. The MND Association focuses on funding research, improving access to care, and campaigning for people with MND in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There are over 11,000 members which forms a network for people with MND, families and carers to get information and support. On Global MND Awareness Day the <a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/">MND Association</a> sought to highlight the issues and challenges, including accessing benefits, housing adaptations, and the disproportionate impact of the cost-of-living crisis on MND sufferers and their families and carers whilst trying to manage MND.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was an absolute pleasure to meet the courageous Afghan Women’s Development Football team who had played against and beaten the Women’s MPs team. I was honoured to sign a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/uk-parliament-calls-on-fifa-to-support-exiled-afghanistan-womens-team">letter to the President of FIFA</a>from UK, Australia, Portugal, and Italy parliamentarians in support of the National and Development teams who have been in exile since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The Taliban immediately banned women’s representation in sports, denying women from national, senior and youth teams to represent their country at international level, in addition to abolishing sports for women at grassroots level. The Afghanistan women’s senior team is in exile in Australia and the development team is in exile in the UK. This year, the World Cup is being co-hosted by Australia, so the time for action is now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Sepsis it was a pleasure to meet Sarah Hamilton-Fairley of <a href="https://sepsistrust.org/">UK Sepsis Trust</a> to finalise arrangements for World Sepsis Day on 13th September. I have applied for a Westminster Hall debate on World Sepsis Day to highlight all the issues and challenges that Sepsis sufferers and survivors face to combat the effects of this serious condition. There is so much that we do not know about Sepsis, and UK Sepsis Trust provide comprehensive support for every person and their families affected by the trauma of Sepsis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was the return from the Lords of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-21/debates/258A03B6-4C90-4CE2-83D9-B0BF35545FF8/Strikes(MinimumServiceLevels)Bill">Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill</a> and we voted on Lords Amendments 5B, 5C, 5D, 4B, and 2B. Lords Amendment 5B would remove the stipulation that Trade Unions have an obligation to ensure that their members comply with a work notice and the responsibility to do so. 5C and 5D are consequential on 5B and will protect trade unions from having to undermine their own otherwise unlawful strikes, and will also remove an employer’s recourse to secure injunctions to prevent trade unions conducting a strike that has been legally balloted. The UK Government voted to disagree with all Lords Amendments – 5B/C/D was defeated by 280-214; Lords Amendment 4B was defeated by 277-209; Lords Amendment 2B was defeated by 283-205.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Official Opposition Day debate was on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-21/debates/C94A8B18-2565-4AF4-9204-6DC455FDB268/AnimalWelfare(KeptAnimals)">Kept Animals Bill</a>. The UK Government tabled an amendment and the opposition parties did not participate in the vote. Their amendment was won by 262 to 0 votes (253 Conservatives, 2 former Conservatives, and Jim Shannon DUP). The Official Opposition moved their motion to a vote, and lost by 256 to 183 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG Rail in Wales held its AGM and I was honoured to be re-elected chair. The APPG will be holding another event in September with all the railway stakeholders that operate or will be operating in Wales – GWR, Grand Union, Network Rail, Avanti, Transport for Wales, the Global Centre for Rail Excellence, plus Professor Mark Barry, Rail Minister Huw Merrimen MP, Shadow Rail Minister Tan Dhesi MP – to update APPG members on services, infrastructure, and future plans they each have to improve rail transport all across Wales and interconnecting border travel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG on Compassion in Politics, chaired by my friend Debbie Abrahams MP, to meet, listen and question, one of the Democratic Candidates for the 2024 US Presidential elections, <a href="https://marianne2024.com/">Marianne Williamson</a>, who spoke about the challenges presented to US and UK democracy and the choices ahead for those who want to save it. Marianne provided frontline insight into US politics. She has written 13 books, including 4 New York Times Bestsellers and in the 2020 elections she was the most Googled candidate in 49 of 50 states, and received 4th most attention on Twitter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I joined my dear friend Baroness Anita Gale at the <a href="http://activewales.org.uk/">Active Wales Conference</a>. Anita is its President, and I have had the honour to have known Anita for over thirty years. Chair of Active Wales, Cllr Barry Stephens, opened the conference. The guest speaker was another friend, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Care, Julie Morgan MS, who spoke about the challenges facing the over-sixties and the support provided by Welsh Government. The conference delegates and branch officers discussed health, transport, digital exclusion, TV licences, and many other issues facing the elderly in Wales. Anita made the closing remarks and the attendees stayed for an afternoon of entertainment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few weeks, my <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-06-29/debates/8AD2CB57-7BC3-43F9-945D-E16373A503C5/BusinessOfTheHouse?highlight=shark%20fins#contribution-DA7A1EBA-4B3A-43C0-A2B9-2B0527EB4BC1">Shark Fins Private Members’ Bill has successfully passed</a> through all its stages in the Lords and last week received its Royal Assent to become an Act of Parliament. My gratitude to Baroness Maggie Jones for taking it through the Lords on my behalf, and to all its supporters, particularly Bite-Back Shark Conservation, The Shark Trust, and Shark Guardian. It’s not often that a backbencher has the opportunity to make law, and my Bill to ban the practice of catching live sharks, cutting off their fins to sell in the global market, and returning the sharks to the ocean to die barbarically by suffocating or bleeding out, gained cross-party support in the Commons, the Lords, and the UK Government supported it through all its stages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed meeting old friends and making new friends at Party in the Park, which was held in Victoria Gardens. It was a pleasure to be with Neath Town Councillors, Sheila Penry, Jan and Alan Lockyer, Bob Price, and Lauren Heard to meet and chat with families and individuals enjoying the wonderful displays in the lovely sunshine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a privilege to welcome Huw Merriman, UK Government Minister for Rail, to visit the <a href="https://www.gcre.wales/">Global Centre of Rail Excellence</a> (GCRE). I invited Huw to visit the GCRE when he responded on behalf of the UK Government to my Westminster Hall debate on Rail Infrastructure in Wales, in which I spoke extensively about the potential and my privilege to be involved in the creation and development of the GCRE since its inception many years ago. The GCRE is a purpose-built site for world class research, testing and certification of rolling stock, infrastructure and innovative new rail technologies. Nowhere in Europe will offer the range and breadth of services provided by GCRE. The 700-hectare site is the same size as Gibraltar and has the potential to offer significant commercial opportunities in complementary areas such as: renewable energy, hydrogen and battery; communication innovations such as 5/6G and spectrum testing; carbon capture projects such as space for up to half a million trees; on-site training in partnership with Further and Higher Education. Huw was given a comprehensive briefing on the history and progress of the GCRE before being given a tour of the site so that he could experience the vast potential of this unique facility that is scheduled to open next year.</p>

    <title>MP Marks Wellbeing Week</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/mp-marks-wellbeing-week/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">Oldham East and Saddleworth MP <span style="color:#06396a;">Marks Wellbeing Week</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Oldham East and Saddleworth MP Debbie Abrahams marked World Wellbeing Week this week by calling for people’s wellbeing to be a key objective of Government, and not just economic growth.</p>
<p>The theme of 2023’s world wellbeing week is anxiety.</p>
<p>Before being elected as the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Ms Abrahams was a public health consultant focusing on health inequalities and Chair of an NHS Trust.</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams MP said:</p>
<p>“World Wellbeing Week is a chance for policymakers to reflect on the centrality of wellbeing in policy decision-making. For too long, policies have chased economic growth at all costs, without considering the importance of the wellbeing of people. Most importantly, we must focus on the equity of this wellbeing – being working 3 jobs while still being poor, cold and hungry will clearly not contribute to people’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>“This year’s theme is anxiety, which is particularly relevant given last week’s rise in interest rates. Constituents across Oldham East and Saddleworth have been in touch with me to express their anxiety about the impact of this on their household finances, and how for many this has increased their anxiety.</p>
<p>“The World Wellbeing Movement has set a challenge to Governments but also local authorities, businesses, schools and individuals to think ‘beyond GDP’ as a success measure, and to look at what gives us fulfilment and enjoyment – our relationships, our green spaces and so on. I hope you can join this movement to a greater enjoyment and fulfilment.”</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I am delighted that the High Wycombe Driving Test Centre has now reopened and commenced testing.  I have spent many hours speaking to people in the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, Ministers in the Department of Transport, and the Council, even holding a debate in Parliament on the issue.  It has been hard work but has been worth it. It is not right learners would have been forced to travel with round trip distances of thirty miles in order to test […]</div>

this situation by the hotel’s owners.&amp;nbsp; It
is a disgraceful and degrading way to treat the workers.&amp;nbsp; The hotel owners, Clearsprings and Tory

    <title>Nottingham castle reopens for all</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/06/26/nottingham-castle-reopens-for-all/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Labour is very pleased that the castle has re-opened today Monday 26th June. On Exec Board meeting we announced that the re-opening of the castle would take place in June and we are delivering on our promise.&lt;br&gt;We have announced a new general admission price of £12 per adult, allowing people to return as many times as they like for a year, along with free entry for up to three accompanied kids aged 15 and under. This is in response to the rising cost of living, which is a serious problem for many of our communities, and will ensure that all families in Nottingham can once again access the castle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are also proud to be opening the castle with an exhibition to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Windrush in cooperation with Museumand and the National Caribbean Heritage museum and to recognise the massive contribution of the Windrush generation and their descendants on our city’s society and economy.&lt;br&gt;Today the reopening of the castle, was marked by Robin Hood and a merry band of local schoolchildren storming the gates, reclaiming the castle for the Nottingham people. Lots of people benefited from a special £1 ticket for the opening day to make our popular heritage site to all.&lt;br&gt;The opening will include access to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the newly reinvigorated Brewhouse Yard that showcases life of Nottingham through the ages from the 1500s to 1900s,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;the launch of ‘70 Objeks &amp;amp; Tings,’ to celebrate Windrush, brought to one of the Museum’s temporary galleries by Museumand (The National Caribbean Heritage Museum)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;a series of artist commissions and interventions on display around the museum, by Jemisha Maadhavji and Tim Fowler.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A visitor centre and café at the entrance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Access to the Robin Hood and Rebellion Galleries&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use of the land train for the first time after a few years&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;a Hood’s Hideout adventure playground in the dry moat for children to enjoy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;access to the caves- Mortimers Hole and King David’s dungeon for £5 per person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will develop a programme of events, exhibitions, gallery talks and school visits, and offer the site for events such as weddings and corporate functions to ensure that the castle provides a wide range of activities for all to enjoy in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pavlos-Lo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pavlos-Lo-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3097"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cllr Kotsonis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The City Council’s Portfolio Holder for Leisure, Culture and Planning, Cllr Pavlos Kotsonis, said: “We are thrilled to reopen Nottingham Castle for the people of Nottingham and for visitors from beyond the city. The castle belongs to the city’s residents and to all our diverse communities and it gives me great joy to be delivering on the promise made for a June reopening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We worked hard to achieve this in such a short time and we are looking forward to seeing people reconnect with a site that is so important to local people and to the city. We feel sure that the reinvigorated offer available will encourage many people to come back time and time again, with the new ticket allowing people to pay £12 once and visit all year round!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;With the sun shining on saturday it was the perfect weather for a summer fayre!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lovely afternoon calling into the summer event at St Johns Church Walsall Wood where I was joined by local Councillors Mandy Parkes and Keith Sears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a friendly and fun atmosphere for all to enjoy and as is usual at such events I left with an armful of homemade cakes and biscuits and a book for my summer reading list!  I was very tempted by the fantastic plant stall too – maybe next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done to Rev Lisa and everyone for organising this.&lt;/td&gt;

<p>As summer arrives, so too does news of the first hosepipe ban of the season and the threat of more to come.</p>



<p>Despite experiencing the wettest March since 1981, parts of the country are already facing a water shortage. Many point to the effects of climate change and its certainly true, across the world, that access to water is as likely to drive migration as much as wars and despots, but here in the UK the finger is increasingly pointed at the behaviour of Britain’s water companies.</p>



<p>Back in 1989 the Thatcher government, having starved state-owned water and sewerage authorities for years of necessary resources to upgrade what is essentially a public health utility, privatised the industry with the promise of vast improvements. Since that time water companies have paid out £72 billion in dividends while increasing our bills by over 40% but there hasn’t been a single, large-scale reservoir built in England since 1981.</p>



<p>Every year there are hosepipe bans all around the country. They destroy plants and gardens, lovingly tended over years, and enjoyed by so many retired people. They close pubs as they can’t maintain hygiene standards at a time when the hospitality trade is struggling, and they cost farmers dear adding further pressures to the cost-of-living crisis.</p>



<p>Last year the combined bonuses for the chief executives of the ten water companies in England and Wales amounted to £14.5billion. Severn Trent’s chief executive is the best paid in the country at around £3.9M, including bonuses. Severn Trent has a four-star rating from the Environment Agency but still managed to discharge sewage into our rivers 45,000 times.</p>



<p>I understand calls to renationalise the water industry although I doubt a priority for an incoming Labour government should be paying billions in compensation to well-heeled shareholders. It’s true something needs to be done, so why not toughen the regulation and take a golden government share in the industry. A share, which allows us to prioritise tackling leaks, building reservoirs, compensating victims of hosepipe bans and ending the pumping of effluent into our rivers, over dividends for shareholders and bonuses for chief executives.</p>

&lt;iframe title="VCMs 22 06 23 15 21 21" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIw4M76rJHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I want to speak on behalf of Ve-Tech Concrete Limited, which is a company in my constituency that operate volumetric mobile concrete plants,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VCMs as they have been described and as it has already been covered by the honourable gentleman for Orkney and Shetland. There are lots of different reasons why there are advantages to these. He&amp;#8217;s already highlighted the fact that they can deliver concrete over distances&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in rural areas that are more than two hours away from a concrete mixing plant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s just an absolute if you&amp;#8217;re further away. A drum concrete mixer simply can&amp;#8217;t serve you. So these can cover parts of the UK that others can&amp;#8217;t. They can also wait until the concrete is required. So when utilities need to make repairs even in the middle of the night or a repair takes longer, the VCM can wait until the concrete is required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can deliver multiple small loads of different strengths of concrete to different consumers. And that is often farmers who need a small amount to make an adjustment around the farm. So in rural communities like mine in Central Ayrshire where farming is covers most of my constituency, the VCMs are vital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would agree with the honourable gentleman who&amp;#8217;s just spoken, whose constituency I can&amp;#8217;t remember. It&amp;#8217;s hard to understand what the 2018 decision was about. If it is about damage to roads, etc, then there are other heavier vehicles that are being allowed on the road. If it&amp;#8217;s about what they carry, and this suggestion that they shouldn&amp;#8217;t carry more goods than a goods vehicle, then there is a failure to understand that actually they are plant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They mix the concrete and therefore they have all the equipment involved in mixing the concrete as it&amp;#8217;s required. And what they also have is pumping equipment so that they don&amp;#8217;t need a separate lorry to turn up to work with a drum mixer, to actually pump the concrete into the place that it&amp;#8217;s required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I heard, I read in the briefing that actually because of access issues, it&amp;#8217;s a VCM that Westminster is using for some of the repairs to the estate. So it&amp;#8217;s really about time that we heard a slightly updated approach to these. So why was the decision made? It&amp;#8217;s hard to understand it if it&amp;#8217;s on the basis of road damage when there are heavier vehicles. It&amp;#8217;s certainly hard to understand it if it&amp;#8217;s about climate. When it&amp;#8217;s clear, VCMs reduce journeys, increase flexibility, and actually are keeping other trucks off the road. So I too hope that maybe there&amp;#8217;s a change of mind in the Department for Transport and maybe the minister will give us some hope and indeed the companies in our constituencies or serving our constituencies right across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Grant Shapps, paid a visit to local charity Resolve to welcome their new CEO as well as meet their team and service users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Resolve is a local charity of which Mr Shapps is the patron. It delivers drug and alcohol support as well as advice and treatment services from its bespoke centre in Woodhall Community Centre in Welwyn Garden City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since it began 15 years ago it has been at the forefront of supporting a wide range of clients with Resolve supporting over 200 people last year alone – running 750 group therapy sessions and 1000 counselling and acupuncture sessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps met the charity’s new CEO, Laura Hyde to discuss how she has been finding the role since taking over in March. He also spent time talking to some of the charity’s clients about their experiences with Resolve, all of which commended the charity for the wonderful support they provide with one client saying, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know where my life would have been without Resolve&amp;#8221;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laura thanked Mr Shapps for visiting and for taking the time to meet the Resolve team and some clients:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was great for some of our Welwyn Garden City team and service users to meet Grant. Grant has been a long-standing supporter of Resolve since it was set up by the founder and former Chief Executive Joe Heeney 15 years ago, with Grant&amp;#8217;s wife even running a fundraising marathon for Resolve many years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am so proud to be the new Chief Executive of Resolve. Resolve saves people&amp;#8217;s lives and helps to support them on their difficult road to recovery”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps thanked Laura and the Resolve team for inviting him to visit:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It was wonderful to meet the Resolve team and Laura. I congratulate her on becoming the new CEO of Resolve. I can see how dedicated and passionate she is about her role, so I know she’ll do Resolve proud”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He continued:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Resolve provides vital support for those that need it the most. I wish everyone all the very best for the future”.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Our fantastic Space Park is bringing together our world leading university research with business and industry in state of the art facilities. It aims to create 2,500 high skill, high paid jobs and generate £750m for the wider East Midlands economy.</p>
<p>Last week I helped host a “Leicester West Secondary School Takeover” day. &nbsp;We put on a series of events and talks to inspire students from Babington, Beaumont Leys, Castlemead and New College to think about pursuing a career in the space sector including in engineering, science, IT, data and design.</p>
<p>It was an absolutely amazing day and I am so grateful to the Space Centre for helping to put it on!</p>

    <title>To save lives, the Government must set new targets to tackle the ‘silent disease’</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/to-save-lives-the-government-must-set-new-targets-to-tackle-the-silent-disease/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As many people die from preventable hip fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes, Judith Cummins MP has revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Tuesday in the House of Commons, Bradford South MP Judith Cummins called on the Government to step up its game on bone fracture prevention and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith has been vocal on the issue of Osteoporosis, which affects half of all women and a fifth of all men over 50. It is characterised by a loss of bone density, leaving people vulnerable to breaks and fractures. Because symptoms often aren’t noticed until a serious break, osteoporosis has been called the ‘silent disease’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raising the issue in Parliament, Judith highlighted the shocking reality of the condition:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Many of these will be serious hip fractures, and as many people will die from these fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questioning the Minister, Judith asked why such a serious condition is so often overlooked in healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Can the Minister explain why not even one of the 63 key performance indicators set by NHS England for Integrated Care Boards sets a target for fracture prevention?’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Maria Caulfield MP, Minister for Women’s Health Strategy, thanked Judith for her longstanding work on bone health. The Minister also highlighted measures the Government is undertaking to tackle Osteoporosis:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘NHS England is expanding fracture services for higher risk women who do have Osteoporosis to prevent falls in the first place.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the Government’s claims to be stepping up fracture services, the limits of the current services mean that 74,000 preventable fractures will occur over the next five years, costing the NHS £665 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making fracture prevention a key performance target could lead to stronger delivery of these services, preventing unnecessary pain, giving patients the level of care they deserve, and saving vital NHS resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the exchange, Judith said that Government support for fracture prevention was still inadequate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Whilst Bradford offers a trailblazing service for those with Osteoporosis, this is not always the case nationally.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘The argument for investing in the prevention of fractures is clear: To save money and save lives, we need a government with the sense to invest in the future of women’s health in this country.’&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>

<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684233937.JPG" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP welcomes school debaters to Downing Street</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2023/03/29/matt-warman-mp-welcomes-school-debaters-to-downing-street/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-4189 aligncenter" srcset="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png 300w, https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the visit &lt;strong&gt;Matt Warman MP commented&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith&lt;/strong&gt; who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

    <title>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd New Warehouse in Andover</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was deeply concerned to read the decision taken by the Court in this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63313556">case</a>.</p>
<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p></div>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="text">Compensation package for Waspi women</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="213" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9aU0xFXMCAI/Xd0FHDpOMAI/AAAAAAAAASc/Cyv2qZ_ta-MUdsiIaJMTYCk644nOT6-LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/LC%2BWaspi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Labour has pledged compensation packages for millions of women hit by state pension age rises imposed by the Tories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a historic debt of honour to them.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
