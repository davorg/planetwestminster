<strong><br/>
The Minister for Media &amp; Data (Mr John Whittingdale):</strong> I can answer my right hon. Friend by saying that I am one of the people he has described precisely, in all three of those measures, and I, too, have occasionally been concerned at what appeared to be a lack of impartiality in the BBC on some of those issues.</p>
<p>That is something that has been, I think, felt by a large number of people. It is the job of the BBC—as I say, it is the first public purpose of the BBC—to deliver impartiality. I know that that is something that the leadership of the BBC which is now in place is absolutely committed to, but it will be examining ways in which that can be strengthened where necessary.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>South Shropshire MP Philip Dunne has welcomed the announcement of £166.5m of government funding to help the UK meet its climate targets on its journey to net zero Britain.</p>

<p>The funding, which is part of the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, aims to accelerate delivery of the new technologies needed to drive Britain’s climate change ambitions, as well as creating over 60,000 jobs across the UK. This includes developing technologies in carbon capture, greenhouse gas removal and hydrogen, while also helping find solutions to decarbonise the UK’s polluting sectors including manufacturing, steel, energy and waste.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne, who is Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee, commented that while this funding is welcome, the government needs to provide much clearer direction to encourage green investment, saying:  </p>

<p>“While today’s announcement of £166.5m to fund new green technology is an important step in the right direction, the Government needs urgently to outline its overall strategy for attracting both public and private sector investment in green technology. Without this, businesses and innovators will struggle to understand the ground rules for future investment decisions, which will seriously impede our ability to develop the technologies required to reach net-zero by 2050.”</p>

<p>The government is committed to meeting the UK’s legally binding target of achieving net zero by 2050, as well as a target of reducing UK emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.</p></div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Covid has only heightened that already difficult challenge – and that’s why I welcomed the opportunity to virtually meet with Breckland and the Hatch consultancy team they have employed to help produce their “Future Breckland” Plans for each of the district’s market towns. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Having worked closely with the Town Councils of Attleborough, Dereham and Watton over the years, I shared some of my insights on what the process should focus to address – and am pleased that so many local stakeholders are going to be approached and included as the Future Breckland Plans are developed. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>I truly believe that, with our region about to become the centre of the UK’s ‘Green Revolution’ – home to thousands of the jobs of tomorrow and improved connectivity, bringing prosperity and a cleaner, greener, healthier way of life for us ALL, we have the opportunity to set out a proper vision of Mid Norfolk – one where we are a thriving hub of vibrant communities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>I look forward to doing all I can to support our local Town Councils as they engage with this process, and to continuing my conversation with Breckland themselves.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Secretary of State for Transport and Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps today has announced a comprehensive reform of the UKs railways. The plans, outlined in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987752/gbr-williams-shapps-plan-for-rail.pdf">Williams-Shapps White Paper</a>, will see rail services managed by a single government body: Great British Rail- with private business contracted to provide key services.</p>
<p>Talking about the announcement, Mr Shapps said: “<span style="font-size: 14px;">I’m delighted to be launching our Plan For Rail- the culmination of a review into the whole of our rail network. Based on our findings, we’re driving ahead with the next exciting era in British rail travel.</span></p>
<p>“We have a proud history of rail travel in this country- from the first steam locomotives in County Durham to the golden age of the Flying Scotsman.</p>
<p>“Our national prosperity was built on the back of the railway. But after years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication, that innovative vision has faded- to the cost of passengers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">“These plans put passengers first, backed by a single, familiar brand- Great British Rail. It will fuse the innovation and capital of the private sector, with the planning and accountability of the public sector to deliver value to the whole of Great Britain- including passengers in Welwyn Hatfield.</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p>“Under these plans, Welwyn Hatfield passengers will be able to enjoy a simpler, more modern rail service. GBR will simplify the current mass of confusing tickets with new flexible season tickets and a significant roll-out of more convenient Pay As You Go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones.”</p>
<p>Grant Shapps also revealed the role that local innovations had in inspiring some of the proposals in the white paper:</p>
<p>“As it so happens, contactless travel beyond the London Oyster system has been provide pioneered here in Welwyn Hatfield- you can now make contactless journeys from WGC, Hatfield, Welham Green and Brookmans Park. Our area has therefore helped pioneer some of the new thinking that has led to the Rail White Paper, following this successful experiment.</p>
<p>“These plans will change rail travel for the better for the people of Hertfordshire, and the whole country. Simple, modern, accountable and with better value for money.”</p>
<p>Great British Railways is set to launch in 2023. A video was produced to accompany the launch, which can be viewed below.</p></div>

&lt;p&gt;Volunteers Week is now in it’s 37th year, and annually celebrates the dedication and work of millions of volunteers up and down the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers Week is taking place during the #MonthOfCommunity which runs throughout June and brings together organisations including Volunteers’ Week, The Big Lunch and Small Charity Week and culminates in Thank You Day on 4 July. The month aims to encourage everyone to think about and join in with the wide variety of positive activities and initiatives happening in local communities across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Over the last year, we have all witnessed the unbelievable work that volunteers have done both on a national level and in our local communities. I would like to take the time to thank all of those who have volunteered over the last twelve months, and those who usually volunteer but have been unable to due to the pandemic. I have seen how great local volunteering can be, and have thoroughly enjoyed volunteering as secretary of Friends of Tame Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From volunteers helping us administer the COVID Vaccine to those who have distributed food parcels to families in need, volunteers have changed and saved lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage everyone across Audenshaw, Denton, Dukinfield, Reddish and the Heatons to take some time to thank Volunteers, and take part in Volunteers Week in any way they can’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Vilbert, interim chief executive at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), which supports the coordination of Volunteers’ Week, said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Volunteers’ Week is about recognising all of those who have delivered vital work as volunteers over the past 12 months. We should acknowledge the huge number of first-time volunteers in communities around the country, and also say thank you to all those who usually volunteer but have not been able to because of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are always working at the heart of every UK community. It is hard to overstate the incredible impact they have made during an incredibly challenging year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has highlighted how much we need each other as a society. Charities and volunteering enable us to put that need into action and remain at the heart of our communities through the best and worst times. As a result of the incredible impact that volunteers have had during the pandemic, and continue to have in the recovery efforts, more people than ever are aware of the immense contribution being made every single day by the amazing volunteers across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must ensure this recognition continues. That is why, on this 37th annual Volunteers’ Week, it’s time to say: thank you volunteers!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Last month, Tim contacted the Secretary of State about the issue of schools paying up to £110,000 to exam boards, despite there being no externally marked A-Level or GCSE exams this summer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tim has also raised the issue of teachers being left further in limbo after the exam board Ofqual has so far failed to let schools know what would be cut from syllabuses next year to reflect the loss of learning time due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"Teachers and teaching staff have worked their absolute socks off during this pandemic to give young people the best possible education in pretty much impossible circumstances.</em></p>
<p><em>"Thanks to the incompetence and indecision of the Department for Education, they have been put under enormous stress and sadly I know that many feel as if they now have reached a breaking point.</em></p>
<p><em>"The very least that the Government can do to support teaching staff and to thank them is to actually pay them for the extra hours they are working."</em></p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-53/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This week saw an unusually high number of All-Party Parliamentary Group meetings.</p>
<p>I attended the AGM of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for MS and was honoured to be elected vice-chair. The theme of the discussion in the meeting was “let’s make it work: supporting people with MS to find work.” In 2016 we produced a report on supporting people with MS in the workplace, and we revisited this to see what has changed and the challenges that persist. We heard from speakers who have experienced issues with employment, the MS Society and the Brain Charity. The pandemic has resulted in some MS sufferers managing their employment better, with greater flexibility of working from home, but some have lost their employment. As restrictions ease, and workplaces reopen, we want to ensure any recovery takes into account lessons from the pandemic and creates a stronger more inclusive society, including access to meaningful employment.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Wales All-Party Parliamentary Group for Hospitality, Events and Major Food and Drink Businesses was held this week. My dear friend Jess Morden MP for Newport East was elected chair and I’m very pleased to become a vice-chair. The APPG will work together with Welsh Government, local authorities and other stakeholders across different parts of the industry and, in every part of Wales, to create an information exchange, a networking circuit, to highlight the positive economic benefits of businesses to Wales.</p>
<p>The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gaps in Support met to hear from Excluded UK and to assess the current position of the campaign for financial support for the millions of people who have not been eligible for the UK Government’s grant schemes. The group are hoping for a public enquiry into why this was allowed to happen, and to seek justice for those who have received no support during the pandemic.</p>
<p>I was very proud to be re-elected chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Sepsis at its AGM. Sepsis is the body’s overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection that can lead to tissue damage and organ failure, and death. It’s the body’s immune system over-responding to an infection. The APPG works with the UK Sepsis Trust to provide a medium through which parliamentarians, organisations, and those affected by Sepsis can discuss the current provisions for the illness which claims nearly 49,000 lives in the UK every year. We raise awareness and promote understanding of Sepsis, and advocate for simple but timely interventions to be implemented as standard procedure across the NHS. The UK Sepsis Trust is run by a small number of dedicated volunteers who have had personal experience of Sepsis.</p>
<p>At its AGM I was elected a vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Ireland and the Irish in Britain. Irish in Britain are the secretariat and work closely with the Irish Embassy to promote Ireland through community organisations and leadership programmes throughout the UK. Wales has always had close cultural and economic links with Ireland, and every year St Patrick’s Day is celebrated in Banwen at the site of St Patrick’s Stone, just off Roman Road, near Dove Workshop. The famous Banwen historian George Brinley Evans has researched and published articles to lay claim that St Patrick and his sister were kidnapped from Banwen when Patrick was a child, and taken to Ireland. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, this year’s St Patrick’s celebration was held online, and we were honoured to have Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales, as our guest speaker.</p>
<p>The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Coalfields Communities met to hear from our coalfields organisations: the Industrial Communities Alliance, Coalfields Regeneration Trust, Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation and the National Union of Mineworkers. There was agreement that we were all concerned about the UK Government’s Levelling Up Fund and Community Renewal Fund. Instead of targeting less prosperous areas most in need, it is a competitive bidding process for local authorities, which take up staff time, and removes cross border collaboration. The timescales to submit bids is far too limited, the deadline is 18th June, and the funding must be spent by end of March 2022. Short timescales place strain on already overstretched staff and don’t encourage creative, strategic, thinking. The list of priority areas excludes Bridgend and Caerphilly, which were classified as severely disadvantaged areas under EU funds. The process bypasses Welsh Government, who historically distributed EU funds, and have responsibility for local agencies which play a huge part in regional economic development. There is no new money, because the funding comes from the now discontinued Local Growth Fund for England, with Barnett consequentials for Wales. The UK Government has transferred funds and reduced them from £1.5bn to £1bn per year. The UKSPF, when it eventually emerges from the UK Government, will merely replace EU funds, and will not be an increase on the £1.5bn per year that used to come from Brussels.</p>
<p>At the final All Party Parliamentary Group I attended this week, I was absolutely delighted to become chair of the APPG for Sport. Former Olympians Lord Colin Moynihan and Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson were elected vice-chairs. Sport is very close to my heart. As a former Welsh Squash International with over 100 caps, a former Squash Wales National Coach, and the only racket coach to be awarded the “Sport Wales Coach of the Year”, I have been campaigning for many years for squash to be included in the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>This week, the Coronavirus Alert Level in Wales was downgraded to 2 and restrictions were loosened. Indoor hospitality has reopened with up to 6 people (from 6 different households) now able to book a table together. Holiday accommodation is also now able to fully reopen, along with entertainment venues and indoor visitor attractions, including cinemas, bowling alleys, theatres, and museums and galleries. Up to 30 people can take part in organised indoor activities and up to 50 people in outdoor activities.</p>
<p>We have all been looking forward to the easing of restrictions, and looking forward to seeing friends and family after such a long and difficult year. But we must still be careful. Please continue to social distance, continue to wash your hands regularly, and continue to wear a mask on public transport and in public places such as supermarkets. The vaccine programme in Wales is going tremendously well – thank you so much to all our hardworking vaccinators – so I hope it will not be too long until we can remove all restrictions.</p>
<p>I was pleased to be given the opportunity to speak during Wales Questions this week. I asked Simon Hart MP, the Secretary of State for Wales, to accept that it is Mark Drakeford’s superb stewardship of the Welsh economy and the Welsh NHS that secured Mark’s overwhelming re-election in the recent Senedd elections and I asked Mr Hart if he would welcome the Welsh Labour Government’s new 10-year infrastructure investment plan for a zero-carbon economy. The Secretary of State dodged my questions by talking about the vaccination programme and the Union. I also asked Mr Hart when the UK Government would release the promised funding for the Global Centre of Rail Excellence that is due to be built here in Neath. Whilst the Secretary of State acknowledged agreement of the UK Government in developing the centre in Neath, he refused to clarify when funding would be released. The Secretary of State and his UK Government speak of the positives in collaboration, but we now require them to hold up their end of the bargain – release the funding so that we can help Welsh communities recover from this terribly difficult year.</p>
<p>This week saw the Urdd’s annual Peace and Goodwill message, which this year centres on equality for women and girls. Women’s rights are human rights. Our international development aims are dependent upon ensuring development for women around the world, but equality begins at home. Let’s remember that women can be self-confident, not bossy; independent not blunt; powerful not emotional; successful not stubborn. How we talk about women and young girls is important and develops a view of what women should be and how they should behave in ways that we simply do not do for men. The Covid pandemic has offered us a reset on how we behave in the world; let’s use that reset as a chance to make things better and not just return to the same.</p>
<p>On Friday morning I attended the reinstated regular Zoom meeting with SBUHB for MSs and MPs in the Swansea Bay Region following their postponement during the Senedd elections campaign period. SBUHB Chair Emma Woolett, vice-chair Steve Spill, CEO Mark Hackett, Director of Public Health and Gold Commander Keith Reid, Deputy Director of Transformation Dorothy Edwards, and Chief of Staff Irfon Rees updated us on progress of the vaccination programme, guidance on vaccination and travel, variants of interest and concern, services and hospital visits, and service impact. SBUBH newsletter updates are found on its <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/rvd9C0YG6txk0x7Swub_4?domain=sbuhb.nhs.wales/">website</a>.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon, as vice-chair of the newly constituted All-Party Parliamentary Group for Restorative Justice, I held a Zoom meeting with Julia Houlston-Clark, Chief Executive of WRAP (Wales Restorative Approaches Partnership), which is an innovative co-operative social enterprise and a not-for-profit community interest company, which supports the building, maintaining, and repairing of relationships across the criminal justice, education, families, communities, and business sectors. Restorative approaches include the day-to-day skills involved in pre-empting conflicts and harm, building and maintaining relationships and community, as well as reacting and responding when things go wrong.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to email on <a href="mailto:christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk">christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk</a> or call on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but as always, we are available should you need to get in contact with us. I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This week the Child Poverty Action Group held a briefing session for MPs ahead of the Westminster Hall debate on Child Food Poverty planned for Monday 24 May.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The session highlighted that there are currently 4.3 million children living in households below the poverty line, and that based on pre-pandemic data at least two in five children living in poverty across England were ineligible for free school meals.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The charity is calling for government action to address these statistics. Primarily they are urging the government to;</p>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>·     Expand eligibility for free school meals to all families receiving universal credit.</li>
                  <li>·     Extend free school meal entitlements to families with no recourse to public funds.</li>
                  <li>·     Implement universal provision of free school meals for all school aged children in England.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Jon Cruddas MP was unable to attend the briefing due to other parliamentary commitments, but his team were present to discuss localised figures.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Based on pre-pandemic data 44 percent of children in Dagenham and Rainham are living in poverty, which is 13 percent higher than the average for the rest of England at 31 percent. It is estimated by the charity that over the course of the pandemic these figures have risen by approximately 3.8 percent.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas said:</strong> <em>“these figures are staggering, even more so when we consider that 75 percent of children living in poverty are in working households. Whilst free school meals are not a magic wand, they do relieve pressures on household budgets, which is why I have been vocal in support of a more accessible system to help tackle inequality.”</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Throughout the pandemic Jon Cruddas has lobbied the government on several occasions regarding free school meals, most notably when the government were forced to reinstate the voucher scheme following a disastrous trial of lunch parcels.</p>

    <title>MacNeil welcomes newly appointed Transport and Islands Ministers</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP, Angus MacNeil has welcomed Graeme Dey MSP as Transport Minister and Mairi Gougeon MSP as Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Islands &amp;#8211; at a time when two huge transport issues are hanging over the islands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting Angus MacNeil said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Clearly the islands have to be protected by maintaining the HIAL jobs and saving the public purse a lot of money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I would look to both Ministers to engage fully with this issue and not to let HIAL empire build in Inverness at the expense of communities.&amp;nbsp; That as well as the need to make sure we have a decent ferry supply in the coming years and looking at all yards in and out of Scotland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is plenty to keep them busy and I hope to see both in the islands this summer to discuss matters with the local community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I also welcome Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s plan for ferries but we should keep our minds open about tunnels where we could use the ferry money in a number of inventive ways to ensure we have fixed links at all times.&amp;nbsp; These things are possible if there is the political will as the Faroe Islands have shown.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><a href="https://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/dramatic-rise-in-child-poverty-in-north-east-england-in-the-last-five-years-shows-the-scale-of-the-levelling-up-challenge/">New figures published yesterday</a> by the End Child Poverty Coalition show that there are over 30,000 children in Leicester living below the poverty line. That’s 6,000 more than there were in 2015. Leicester saw the biggest increase in child poverty in the East Midlands, and one of the highest in the country overall.</p>
<p>This is an appalling indictment of the Government over the last decade. Even before the pandemic hit, we were experiencing high levels of child poverty in the city. Since then, 2,500 more children in Leicester are claiming free school meals, the number of people claiming Universal Credit has doubled, and there has been a 300% increase in the number of people using foodbanks.</p>
<p>Child poverty does not just affect children while they’re growing up, it impacts them throughout their lives and affects us all. If children find it hard to study and work because they’ve gone to bed hungry, or live in overcrowded housing that makes it difficult for them to complete their homework, it makes it harder for them to achieve their full potential. And if they cannot achieve their full potential, then our country as a whole misses out on their talent, throughout their lives.</p>
<p>I chair <a href="https://feedingbritain.org/location/leicester/">Feeding Leicester</a>, a partnership that aims to end hunger in the city, and we are doing our best – but we cannot reach everyone who needs help. We cannot build back a better country if children are still growing up in poverty. The Government needs to take action to tackle this serious issue.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-11412 aligncenter" src="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Food-bank-meeting-7-May-2-300x219.jpg" alt="" width="371" height="271" srcset="https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Food-bank-meeting-7-May-2-300x219.jpg 300w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Food-bank-meeting-7-May-2-740x541.jpg 740w, https://www.grahamstuart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Food-bank-meeting-7-May-2.jpg 958w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"/></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Food banks in Beverley and Holderness have shared their concerns and experiences of the pandemic in a recent meeting with their local MP, Graham Stuart.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Food banks, including representatives from Withernsea’s SHoRes Centre, the Cherry Tree Centre in Beverley and Hedon Food Bank, as well as East Riding Voluntary Action Services (ERVAS), took the opportunity to outline how demand for their services had increased since March 2020. In some cases, food bank referrals have seen an almost 300% rise compared to 2019.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">All in all, the five food banks present at the meeting have helped more than 70,000 people through the pandemic as residents have had to cope with unprecedented disruption to their livelihoods, including reduced wages and in some cases, redundancies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Now, with Covid-specific funding drawing to a close, Graham will be taking their concerns to the Communities Secretary, Rob Jenrick, and the leader of East Riding Council.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Following the meeting, Graham said: “It is of course concerning to hear how demand for food banks has shot up as a result of the pandemic, but I was pleased to hear that they have all benefited from Government grants to cover food costs and that recently established food strategies and alliances are working.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“It’s also incredibly inspiring to hear from those who have selflessly worked so hard to help people who’ve been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“There were some interesting points raised about the need for a grassroots strategy to lift people out of poverty so that the demand for food banks lessens and that it would be useful if grant funding could help with this, rather than just being targeted at supplying food. As a result, I will be raising this with both Ministers and the council to ensure that the need for a post-Covid strategy is on their radar.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Another issue raised was that with the winding-down of the furlough scheme, many volunteers at the food banks will be returning to their day jobs, meaning that distributing food will become harder without the workforce to do it. Graham has confirmed that workforce issues in the voluntary sector is something else he will be raising.</span></span></p>
<p>Natalie Taylor-Robinson, Food Bank Development Officer at ERVAS, added: “It was really useful to meet with some our member food banks across Beverley and Holderness to share our concerns with Graham.”</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a huge uptake in demand because of the pandemic, as well as a change in the type of people we’re seeing at our centres. Our sector will be at the forefront of the country’s recovery from coronavirus, and we will need the correct support in place to do this.”</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="http://johnpenrose.org/wp/2021/05/20/westons-mp-welcomes-council-u-turn-on-school-transport-thanks-to-people-power/"><![CDATA[
<p>John Penrose, Weston&#8217;s MP, has welcomed North Somerset Council’s letter confirming a u-turn to continue providing buses for Churchill school students until at least Easter 2022 as a victory for local people-power and for Councillor Ann Harley, who has been working with John closely to represent local concerns.<br><br>John took to Twitter to praise those involved, saying: &#8220;it’s a big win for people power; both local parents &amp; District Councillor Ann Harley who&#8217;ve campaigned strongly &amp; worked with me closely to make sure pupils can get to school safely &#8220;</p>



<h2>Notes </h2>



<p><strong>A full copy of the letter sent to John and local parents is available below:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Update on progress with the safe walking routes and home to school transport</strong></p>



<p>We’re writing to make sure you’re kept up to date on progress with the safe walking route scheme and the arrangements for home to school bus transport.</p>



<p>We are now expecting to continue providing buses until Easter next year. Previously we’d told you that we expected to stop them at the end of this month. Bus services will instead be continuing, and we’ll contact you again when we have a firm date for being able to approve the walking route for use.</p>



<p>If you need to apply for a new or amended application for Home to School Transport in the meantime, we’ll process this in line with the Home to School Transport Policy.</p>



<p>Once we’ve completed our work, we’ll send you a link to a route video to help you and your family familiarise yourselves with it. We’ll also install temporary warning signs where we’ve made changes to the road layout. We’re continuing to offer free Bikeability cycle training for children at Winscombe and Sandford primary schools and Churchill Academy.</p>



<p>Independently of our work to ensure the safe walking route meets the requirements for opening, other works are being carried out in the second half of the year which will impact on the use of the section from Sandford via Thatchers. Therefore, we’ll also keep the home to school transport service going until all this work is completed. In this area we also have longer term plans to provide alternative walking routes.</p>



<p>We’ve also now improved the public transport connections locally. We launched three new public services with connections to Churchill Academy last month and are also offering school pupil only journeys.</p>



<p>Copies of the timetables are available from traveline sw &#8211; welcome and here are the route descriptions:</p>



<p><strong>Route 51 / 51s– Weston-super-Mare to Langford</strong><strong><br>(via Haywood Village, Locking, Banwell, Winscombe and Churchill).</strong></p>



<p>• Monday to Friday service operated by Stagecoach West using a 37-seat<br>service bus.<br>• Operating roughly every 2 hours these services will connect into the 991<br>and 992 feeder services at Langford Post Office.<br>• Two school pupil only journeys that operate as 51s from Churchill<br>Academy to Winscombe.</p>



<p><br><strong>Route 991 – Langford to Wrington and Route 992 – Langford to Blagdon.</strong><br>• Monday to Friday service operated by Weston &amp; District using a 12-14<br>seat wheelchair accessible minibus.<br>• Operating roughly every 2 hours and (alternate hours, so 1 hour will be a<br>991, the next will be a 992 and so on) and will connect into the 51 service<br>at Langford (Post Office).<br>• Two school pupil only journeys that operate as 991s from Churchill<br>Academy to Winscombe (with one extended to Felton &amp; Winford).<br>As we’ve said in our previous letters to you, we remain committed to continuing the bus<br>arrangements until we’re satisfied that we’ve resolved the quality and safety issues of the<br>walking route.<br><br>If you’ve got any queries in the meantime, please get in touch.<br><br>Yours sincerely</p>



<p>On behalf of the Integrated Transport Unit<br>Development &amp; Environment<br>North Somerset Council</p>

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Last week’s exposé by the BBC journalist Alex Homer on the deaths of over 150 social security claimants, mostly since 2010 and often under desperate circumstances, shocked many. Anyone listening to Philippa Day, 27, sobbing on the phone and pleading for help after her Personal Independence Payment (Pip) had been stopped, leaving her £5,000 in debt, would have been moved.</p>
<p>Philippa, a diabetic, died after taking an overdose of insulin in 2019. The coroner found that the government had failed her and issued a Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) report to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and to the company who had assessed her as not needing Pip support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe that these deaths are probably just the tip of the iceberg. As the National Audit Office’s February 2020 report into the suicides of claimants revealed: “It is highly unlikely that the 69 cases the department [for Work and Pensions] has investigated represents the number of cases it could have investigated in the past six years.”</p>
<p>And yet the government just carries on, tweaking the internal arrangements within the DWP where the deaths of some claimants are examined, “to learn the lessons”, as they say. But are they? I have been campaigning for over three years for an independent public inquiry into the deaths of vulnerable claimants because there is no evidence that the government is learning.</p>
<p>The death of David Clapson, a diabetic, in 2013, after he had been sanctioned and had no money for electricity to keep his insulin cold; the suicide of Fazia Ahmed in 2014, when the coroner issued a PFD report saying that failings in the DWP had contributed to her death; the suicide of Jodey Whiting in 2017 after she was found fit for work and her social security support was stopped despite her being housebound; the death from multiple organ failure of Stephen Smith in 2018 who weighed 6st after his social security support was stopped; and of Errol Graham, who had severe mental illness, who was only 4st 7lb when he died the same year.</p>
<p>Five PFDs have been issued since 2010; it would have been six but the government promised to improve its safeguarding policy in 2019, which we are still waiting for. These are only a handful of the cases, and the government has done nothing to identify the scale of the issue.</p>
<p>For example, exactly how many vulnerable claimants such as Philippa have died after their PIP was stopped? In an answer to a written question in 2019 by Madeleine Moon, the former MP for Bridgend, figures suggested that over 130 working age people a month were dying soon after being found ineligible for PIP by the government contractors Atos and Capita. Other data is more vague.</p>
<p>And what is driving these deaths? If the government is so concerned with stopping these deaths, why did it dismiss the recommendations from the cross-party work and pensions committee’s recent report on universal credit and the five-week wait for financial support, when we highlighted the ad hoc way vulnerable claimants were being identified by work coaches and the risks this posed?</p>
<p>As a constituency MP, I have had a number of cases where it was abundantly clear that there had been flaws in the health assessments conducted either for PIP or Employment Support Allowance. I have also seen people being sanctioned — when social security support could stop for up to two years — for no reason.</p>
<p>There is also mounting evidence of the impact on claimants’ mental health of what has been described as a dehumanising culture in the DWP and the swingeing cuts in support to working age claimants — over £33 billion since 2010. As a former public health consultant, I think it is reasonable to say that the debt and poverty that claimants are facing will also contribute to their poor health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The publicity around Philippa and other people’s deaths was a watershed moment. Family members of other claimants who had died contacted me from all over the country and asked me to add their names to the list; they thought the deaths of their fathers, mothers, sisters, bothers, sons or daughters were isolated cases. Sadly, they are not.</p>
<p>The government can no longer be allowed to mark their own homework. There must be an independent public inquiry to understand the true scale and causes behind these deaths. Otherwise there will be more relatives left without their loved ones.</p>

    <title>Dear Newcastle May 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/05/dear-newcastle-may-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Dear Newcastle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that we have spent over a year now in various forms of lockdown with so much loss of life and so much sacrifice by so many. We hope that there is a sustainable path out of the Covid restrictions and that we can build back a fairer, better society.  A big part of this is the vaccine rollout, which continued to be successful in the North East with  great co-ordination between the NHS, Public Health professionals and volunteers. Our infection rates have reduced to around 40 per 100,000 but this is still the highest amongst the seven local authorities and twice the UK average. However it is positive that despite easing of certain restrictions we have not seen any spike in infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But part of building back better is investment in local communities and businesses and we are yet to see a plan from this Government that does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Newcastle it was good to see non essential shops opening in a covid secure way. So many local businesses have suffered during lockdown, it is important to support them as much as possible. I want to thank everyone who has followed the rules during this difficult time and I hope everyone can look forward to a better spring and summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parliament my work focused on  two of the Bills I am leading on for Labour – the National Security and Investment Bill and the Advanced Research and Innovation Bill – as well as continuing to highlight the impact of the pandemic, and Brexit, on the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backbench and Constituency Role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was great to be able to be able to have some face to face meetings, in accordance with Covid restrictions, to hear direct from constituents what their concerns were!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government’s Race Report was published, refusing to recognise institutional racism. I heard from many constituents concerned about the report and worked with colleagues and comrades to co-ordinate a response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding issues and demands for support for constituents and businesses as we follow the roadmap out of lockdown, the Horizon scandal and the need for a government inquiry, the life cycle of electric vehicles, medical care for veterans and identity theft. I have contacted numerous members of the Cabinet with questions that arose as a result of the student open meeting I hosted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Shadow Ministerial and PES Role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Online Safety Bill will be introduced in the new session and we continue to engage with stakeholders with regard to what should be in it! There is significant interest in adding aspects of online harm not currently covered such as financial harms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working on the launch of our Digital Report on May 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.  I spoke to the Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee the importance of a proper regulatory framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Parliament returned mid April the  ARIA Bill had its Committee Stage. We are supportive of the Bill but feel changes are required to make it more effective and accountable for example the fact the Government wants to exempt it from Freedom of Information Requests and normal procurement rules is worrying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The National Security and Investment Bill came back to the Commons for ping pong  with the Lords over Intelligence and Security Committee oversight. Despite concerns expressed by many members of Parliament and peers the Government refused to budge!&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Karin Smyth MP condemns the Government for neglecting the social care crisis in the Queen’s Speech</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, condemns the Government’s failure to deliver on their promises to tackle the social care crisis or even set out a plan, which is neglecting millions of people currently receiving inadequate care and leaving families subjected to years of financial, physical and mental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;658 days ago, Boris Johnson said he had a “clear plan” for fixing the social care system, and promised to bring forward plans for reform.  There were expectations that these plans would be introduced in the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday, yet the Government failed to include any mention of social care reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families across the country are reliant on adult social care, from dementia care, long-term illnesses to Special Education Needs.  Government failure to cap social care costs and increase the number of spaces available in social care facilities is making care more difficult to access, leaving families dealing with growing pressure, anxieties and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social care has been a fragmented sector propped up by underpaid and undervalued staff for too long. The pandemic has brutally exposed the fundamental flaws in a system which so many people depend on, resulting in unbearable stress being put on families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last year has only increased the urgent need to reform the system, yet the Government continue to fail to deliver on their promises.  The longer we wait, the longer people will receive inadequate care, and hospitals will be unable to discharge people due to the shortage of social care places. As someone who previously worked in the NHS I can tell you that without joined up thinking between health and social care we will never sort out the issues facing our NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important that we see plans for reform so we can develop a sustainable social care system which can properly support the growing number of people who rely on it to live a happy and healthy life. It’s time for the Government to step up and put plans in place for meaningful and effective change, be more transparent on plans to reorganise the system, and offer our hardworking NHS and social care staff the pay rise they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tory plans will see over 1 million people in our region become ineligible to vote </title>

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>In the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday, plans were announced to launch a new mandatory voter ID system. While it might seem like a sensible step forward, in practical terms, it would require voters to have accepted forms of ID to take to the ballot box.  </p>
<p>In the West Midlands, only 79% of people have a passport. That’s 1,149,137 who would no longer be able to vote. This number drops even further, to 75%, when talking about the number of voters with a driver's licence.  </p>
<p>These new measures which the Government wish to introduce will politically silence more than a fifth of people in the West Midlands and is a dangerous precedent to set against our democratic rights.  </p>
<p>The Conservative Government are looking to put this in place, at a cost of around £20 million per election in a bid to prevent voter fraud. While preventing voter impersonation is a laudable goal, it is a costly and unnecessary one and simply distracts people from the growing issues that are at the heart of our country. </p>
<p>At the elections in 2019, the Police found that of the 58m votes cast, just 33 related to voter impersonation. This means a £20 million cost will be enacted to address something which affect 0.000057% of all votes. Surely, there must be a more cost-effective solution which can be found for such a relatively non-existent issue? </p>
<p>Most concerningly, we do not have information on how this will affect minority groups or low-income households. There is only data available to tell us about the age, sex and region of ID holders. </p>
<p>The pandemic has shown us the stark inequalities that are rife throughout our country and are growing. While solutions to address some of these inequalities might be more complex to correct, this is straightforward. Simply, do not introduce legislation that will have a disproportionate effect on those who are already facing a huge imbalance. </p>

    <title>Events at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Events at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT FROM JUDITH CUMMINS MP&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I share the concerns of the many hundreds of constituents who have contacted me about the Sheikh Jarrah evictions and the appalling and deteriorating situation in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. I condemn the attacks on civilians that have taken place in recent days.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These are deeply troubling events and together with my Labour parliamentary colleagues I am pressing the UK government to act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many experts in the field and the United Nations’s spokeperson on Human Rights has stated, if the Sheikh Jarrah evictions are set in motion it would be a grave violation of Israel’s obligations under international law. The international community must hold the Israeli authorities to account for its actions and the UK government must step-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque site is sickening. &amp;nbsp;It would be abhorrent at any time but for it to take place during Ramadan is callous and can only fuel the enmity which has taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK government’s response to these events has been disappointing. &amp;nbsp;Britain cannot be a passive observer and must step forward to insist that the Israeli authorities stop the violence, injustices and violations of Palestinian human rights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I will continue to advocate for the rights of the Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It’s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cold weather has been harsh enough recently to trigger the Cold Weather Payments System, and some residents will receive an additional £25 towards the costs of heating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eligibility of CWPS is for those who are currently in receipt of some benefits, with pension credit serving as the most common eligibility criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents in the following postcodes will be eligible; RG28, SO21, SP10, SP11, SP4, SP9, RG19, RG20, RG21, RG22, RG23, RG25, RG26, RG7&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus &#8211; support for local businesses &amp; high streets:</span></strong></p>
<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>
<p>I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement of the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of April 2021, and the extension of the business loan schemes until the end of March. You can find more information on the support and grants available for you or your business <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
