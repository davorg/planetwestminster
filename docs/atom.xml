    <title>Goldilocks policy?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/03/13/goldilocks-policy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>      Janet Yellen the US treasury Secretary wants to run the US economy hot. She wants Daddy Bear’s porridge straight from the cooker. The Uk authorities seem to be looking for Goldilock’s favourite, neither too hot nor too cold. The UK has done under half the monetary loosening of the USA. After a similar large fiscal response last year the USA is now doubling up with its monster $1.9tn further package whilst the UK is looking to phase out the special cv 19 assistance and get borrowing under more control this year. So who will fare better?</p>
<p>       It seems likely  the USA will grow faster this year than the UK and certainly faster than the EU which is struggling with vaccines and continued lockdown. The  $1400 cheques for most adults sent by the state will combine  with the substantial savings accumulated over the lockdowns by the many who kept their jobs but faced restrictions on travel and other spending. This  means there is plenty of consumer firepower to unleash. As soon as enough states have relaxed restrictions on retail, leisure, entertainment, hospitality and travel there will be surge in new spending. </p>
<p>        What is less clear is has the USA decided to overheat? Could some of that formidable spending power generate more price rises than is desirable? The thought of world re opening has already powered a substantial increase in the price of energy and some other commodities. There has been a sharp rise in freight rates as trade picks up, and a substantial price rise for semiconductors as a world shortage emerges. Will restaurants, hairdressers, holiday firms and hotels respond to a sudden revival in bookings to put up prices, in an effort to recoup some of the losses from the last year? Will there be many economic areas where capacity has been cut by closures that prove permanent, giving more pricing power to those who remain?</p>
<p>         The authorities are relaxed. They want a bit more inflation, a bit more pricing power for companies to generate some cash again. The US expects inflation currently at 1.7% to rise towards 3% and to stay above their 2% target for a bit. They do not expect a price/wage spiral. The high level of unemployment and the need to get so many people back to work suggests to them wages will stay under control.</p>
<p>          If the USA is right and it can get away with the huge stimulus it has administered without a worrying inflation, the UK has underdone it a bit. If the USA has gone too far with its monetary and borrowing bazooka, the UK may turn out to be Goldilocks after all. </p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-46/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, on Saturday 6th March, I attended the Wales Co-operative Party Council AGM. Swansea Cllr Sam Pritchard has done an excellent job in the chair for the past three years, but he decided to step aside, allowing Jackie Jones, former Labour MEP for Wales, and present Senedd Candidate for Preseli Pembrokeshire to become the chair. Swansea Cllr Wendy Lewis was elected vice chair and KC Gordon re-elected secretary. I presented my Parliamentary Co-operative Party Group report and paid tribute to Deputy General Secretary of the Co-operative Party and General Secretary of the Wales Co-operative Party Karen Wilkie who is retiring after 26 years service.</p>
<p>This week I spoke during the Department for Work and Pensions Oral Questions. I asked the Minister to urgently correct the anomaly whereby someone with a severe condition eligible for an ongoing award under the normal rules has a light-touch review after 10 years, but someone with a terminal illness such as motor neurone disease has to reapply after three years under the special rules or risk having their benefits stopped. It is utterly nonsensical and uncompassionate, forcing those with terminal illnesses who are fortunate enough to live beyond three years to reapply for welfare support. The UK Government have said that they are reconsidering the rules, but I will continue to push them to correct this injustice.</p>
<p>I spoke during the debates on the Chancellor’s Budget, which has created a new cliff edge at the end of September. The furlough scheme, the 5% VAT reduction for food and drinks in hospitality, and the £20 uplift to Universal Credit all stop at the end of September. Plus, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts peak UK unemployment of 6.5% at the end of September – that is 2.2 million people without jobs at a time when coronavirus and flu may be overwhelming. The Chancellor’s Budget is rhetoric over substance, playing down his £4 billion of cuts. But once again, the Welsh Labour Government have stepped in to protect public services, build a greener future and create positive change for a more equal Wales, filling in the Chancellor’s gaps in support to move Wales forward. The Welsh Labour Government’s £2 billion Economic Resilience Fund is the most generous coronavirus support package in the UK, securing 141,000 jobs in Wales. An extra £150 million will also be available through the non-domestic rates scheme, with each business receiving up to £5,000. The business rates holiday for retail, leisure and hospitality in Wales will be extended for 12 months, with a targeted, responsible £380 million for businesses with rateable value up to £500,000, plus charities. Only the Welsh Labour Government are ensuring that businesses are supported through these difficult times.</p>
<p>This week, the UK Government has finally listened to campaigners, sporting bodies, and MPs to close a loophole in the law that allows sports coaches and other people in positions of power to have sexual relations with 16- and 17-year-olds in their care. The Positions of Trust law, which is used to prevent relations between adults in positions of trust and power, such as teachers and social workers, with young people in their care will be extended as part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill. I’ve worked with so many young people over the years, coaching squash and it is such a rewarding experience to see young people grow and develop. They should be allowed to do this without concerns of abuse from the adults they look to for support and guidance.</p>
<p>As chair of the Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology All-Party Parliamentary Group, and vice chair of the APPG Gaps in Support, we combined APPGs to listen to Keith Conniford CEO/Registrar of the Hair and Barber Council and Helen Ward owner of a large salon in London speak about the lack of support from the UK Government throughout the pandemic. Keith and I have written to the PM, Chancellor and Business Minister many times asking for support, for example, that the 5% VAT reduction for hospitality be extended to the hair and beauty industry, but we have been ignored until last week’s budget, where a restart business scheme was announced, but this is a one off grant up to £18,000 and is based on the rateable value of a salon. Self-employed and mobile hair and beauty practitioners are still excluded, and being low wage earners have used the little savings they may have accrued to survive since the first lockdown was imposed, and are now in debt. The professional hair, barber and beauty sector contributed over £6.6 billion pounds per annum, employed over 337,000, in over 40,000 businesses in the UK before coronavirus, and deserves more recognition and support from the UK Government.</p>
<p>As vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for History and Archives, we received a presentation from Jeff James, CEO of the National Archives (NA), and senior colleagues. The NA houses an incredible variety of records from famous wills to Foreign Office correspondence. We heard about the recently released political papers, under the twenty-year rule. The NA is also responsible for publishing legislation and has published 895 Statutory Instruments since December 2020. All of this information is provided free by digital download. National Archives also provides training for regional archives to build digital capacity and distributed the £500,000 Archive Covid Fund to rescue collections, but the fund was massively oversubscribed, which illustrates the importance of preserving our history.</p>
<p>The APPG for HIV and AIDS held a Q&amp;A session with Lord Speaker. After a visit to America in the 1980s, Lord Speaker realised there was a need to deal with the AIDS crisis as a public health issue, and launched a nationwide multi-agency campaign, “Don’t Die of Ignorance” to educate people about HIV and AIDS because it was a killer disease. But with huge advances in testing and treatment new infections can be prevented. If someone living with AIDS is on effective treatment, they can’t pass it on. But there remains massive global challenges, in 2019 there were 1.7 million new infections and 690,000 people died of an AIDS-related illness. Unfortunately, the stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS is still prevalent today.</p>
<p>I was re-elected vice chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic condition, whereby sufferers cannot ingest protein, and must live on a very low protein restrictive diet avoiding meat, fish, dairy, eggs, plus having to endure a foul tasting protein substitute. The side effects, if they don’t, are immense – depression, confusion, memory loss, anxiety, loss of motor skills, and hospitalisation.</p>
<p>We have been campaigning for many years for the medication Sapropterin (Kuvan) made by Biomarin, which allows sufferers to eat a normal diet, to be approved and provided to all sufferers of PKU.  However, last Thursday the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), published its preliminary assessment on Kuvan treatment and recommended its use only for children up to the age of 18, and have not made a recommendation on its use in pregnancy, nor pre-conception.</p>
<p>There is now a consultation period which ends on 18th March, and we shall be submitting evidence from the National Society of PKU, and our constituents, which will justify the use of Kuvan in adults, as well as in children. We shall also be writing to NICE. It’s good news for under 18s, but very disappointing that once a PKU sufferer reaches 18, Kuvan treatment is suddenly withdrawn, and that adult sufferers are excluded.</p>
<p>It was great to speak during the International Women’s Day debate in the House of Commons on Thursday. It is a great privilege to be the first female MP for Neath – and wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the first female General Secretary of Welsh Labour, Baroness Anita Gale of Blaenrhondda, fighting for All Women Shortlists. Baroness Gale was succeeded as Welsh Labour Gen Sec by my honourable friend the MP for Newport East, Jessica Morden, and the current General Secretary of Welsh Labour, Louise Magee – three inspirational female leaders. Gwenda Thomas, the first and only female Senedd Member for Neath, is a staunch advocate for equal opportunities. As a Labour and Cooperative MP, I will miss my dear friend Karen Wilkie, who is retiring as Deputy General Secretary of the Cooperative Party in June, after 26 years of loyal service. We also have some fantastic female artistic talent originating in Neath: Katherine Jenkins, renowned soprano, Sian Philips famous actress and singer, and singer Bonnie Tyler.</p>
<p>During the 1984 Miners’ Strike, women were at the front of picket lines, organised valley support groups, and kept spirits up across South Wales. Pride was filmed in Onllwyn Welfare Hall, called the Palace of Culture, by my dear friend Hywel Francis. Dove Workshop was formed during the Strike, by women for women, its founders were Hefina Headon, Mair Francis, and Lesley Smith and they retrained women to gain qualifications.</p>
<p>Welsh women are also pioneers in sport. As a former Welsh Squash International with over 100 caps and the only female Squash Wales National Coach, I was awarded the Sport Wales Female Coach of the Year in 2008, for my contribution to squash. I’m proud of all our current Welsh Squash Senior Internationals, including Tesni Evans ranked World number 9 – Commonwealth bronze medalist, British Champion two years running, Emily Whitlock former World number 12, and Ellie Breach age 15 and sister Millie age 13 from Neath – Ellie and Millie are age group internationals. Squash Wales held an International Women’s Day virtual session with Tesni and over 40 women across Wales joined in. And I’ll continue to fight for squash to become an Olympic sport. My friend Bethan Howell, captain of Seven Sisters RFC Ladies Section, a Welsh International and Ospreys player, is a fighter for women’s equality, on and off the field, and I am immensely proud to be Patron of Seven Sisters Ladies.  I was delighted to highlight all these amazing women in the Commons this week.</p>
<p>I am incredibly proud to represent Neath, to promote and encourage women in all fields, and to be a role model for young girls who are now growing up, knowing that they too can fight for a better world. But the job I am most proud of doing is being a mother. I thank my daughter Angharad from the bottom of my heart for her love and support. Angharad is my world and I am so proud of the woman she has become.</p>
<p>You may have seen today’s announcement that from tomorrow (Saturday 13th March) Covid-19 restrictions will begin to relax slightly in Wales, with more scope for meeting outside, participating in outdoor sports, and a roadmap for the reopening of non-essential retail, as well as a return to school for more children.  I know these changes will come as a welcome relief to us all, but we need to make sure we keep sticking to the rules as they change so we don’t lose any of the hard-fought progress we have made.  You can keep up to date with all the Welsh Government’s announcements on their dedicated Coronavirus page: <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus">https://gov.wales/coronavirus</a></p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any matters that fall under my role as MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe!</p>

  <title>‘Why is there a reopening date for nightclubs but not for outdoor education?’ – MP blasts Government’s treatment of outdoor centres</title>

  <summary type="text">Local MP Tim Farron has accused the Prime Minister of turning his back on the outdoor education sector.
Last month, in a response from a question in Parliament from Tim, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he "cannot see why" outdoor education couldn't reopen alongside schools on March 8th.
However this week, the Department for Education told Tim that a ban on all school visits for outdoor education centres will continue and gave no date for when this could change.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Local MP Tim Farron has accused the Prime Minister of turning his back on the outdoor education sector.</p>
<p>Last month, in a response from a question in Parliament from Tim, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he "cannot see why" outdoor education couldn't reopen alongside schools on March 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>However this week, the Department for Education told Tim that a ban on all school visits for outdoor education centres will continue and gave no date for when this could change.</p>
<p>In a letter to Tim, Baroness Berridge, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System said: "<em>Unfortunately due to the</em> <em>present climate and the national restrictions placed on the country we are now</em> <em>advising against all domestic/international day and residential educational</em> <em>visits.</em></p>
<p><em>"Officials are continuing to work across Government, with industry bodies and</em> <em>sector representatives to address the issues arising from the outbreak and to</em> <em>help them plan for the safe reintroduction of residential educational visits, when</em> <em>it is safe to do so."</em></p>
<p>Reacting to the letter, Tim said: <em>"This completely flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told me in the House of Commons only last month.</em></p>
<p><em>"If education really is a priority for Government then why is there a reopening date for nightclubs but not for school visits to outdoor education centres?</em></p>
<p><em>"This sector has a massive role to play in improving children's mental and physical health, their confidence and also for reconnecting them with a love of learning.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Government must stop treating outdoor education as an afterthought and give the centres the clarity and confidence they need to plan for the future."</em></p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233352" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TR-NHS-pay-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TR-NHS-pay-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TR-NHS-pay-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TR-NHS-pay-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TR-NHS-pay-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TR-NHS-pay.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the battle against Coronavirus, our NHS workers have been on the frontline more than anyone else. They’ve put their lives on the line day after day, week after week, month after month to provide care and treatment to those in need. Sadly, hundreds have died. Those that have not been seriously ill themselves have been overstretched and in the most stressful situations imaginable. They have had to deal first-hand with the terrible consequences of this virus, which has so far killed around 125,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnessing so much death and suffering with all resources stretched beyond breaking point has unsurprisingly had a huge impact on staff. Studies suggest that almost 40% of ICU staff are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We owe such a lot to the staff in our NHS for all that they do and have done. In my view, this doesn’t just mean praise, applause or admiration &amp;#8211; their service, dedication and hard work should be reflected in their pay. It is nothing short of a disgrace, therefore, that the Government has decided to offer a pay rise of just 1%. In real terms, this is a pay cut. Let that sink in – the Tories are “rewarding” our NHS workers with a real terms pay cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson and the rest of them have been full of warm words for our NHS, but when it comes down to it, this is what they decide to do. And it is a decision – as with all public spending, last week’s Budget was a question of priorities and Johnson and Sunak have decided not to prioritise paying our NHS staff properly. Not even after all that they have done in the past year – it’s truly insulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the Government’s rationale for this is that it would be unfair on private sector workers to give this pay rise. This doesn’t stack up. During this crisis, the Government has – rightly in my view – directly supported millions of workers, largely in the private sector, through furlough. In comparison, the cost of giving our NHS workers a decent pay rise is tiny. Again, it comes back to priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the dedication and hard work of our NHS workers (and others such as our care workers who remain massively underpaid) Covid would have overwhelmed our country and many thousands more would have died. The Prime Minister would do well to remember this. If he’s to do yet another u-turn, he should save everyone a lot of hassle and get it done now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Karin Smyth MP demands apology from Prime Minister for “failing Bristol South’s young people”</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin Smyth MP demands apology from Prime Minister for “failing Bristol South’s young people”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, used yesterday’s Prime Minister’s Question session in Parliament to ask the Prime Minister for an apology to young people in the area for his string of failures in providing the jobs and apprenticeships they so desperately need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;During the fiery exchange, Karin Smyth MP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“This Government are failing young people. Before the pandemic apprenticeship starts were down by 28% for under-19s and £330 million of unspent levy went back to the Treasury, falling short by 81% in creating the promised 100,000 new apprenticeships.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Bristol South MP’s question underscored the Government’s failure on this issue – and showed how she has worked with local organisations over many years to fill the gap left by central Government with their own jobs and apprenticeship fairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Successive Tory Governments have failed young people in South Bristol, but none more so than Boris Johnson’s. When we needed investment into further education and apprenticeships, we saw £330 million being returned, unspent, to the Treasury to be spent on who knows what. It’s as offensive as it is inexplicable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“So where the Government is failing, I am once again joining organisations across Bristol and stepping in. My fifth annual jobs and apprenticeships fair is a chance for the young people in the constituency to listen to expert advice, make new contacts and discover new opportunities they may never have considered before. This virtual event is supported by Bristol City College and a number of important employers, so will really help you find your way into the world of work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Karin’s fifth annual jobs and apprenticeship fair for the young people of Bristol South, run in conjunction with Bristol City College and local employers, will ensure that people looking for a way into further education and employment will get detailed advice and support on how they can unlock their potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The jobs and apprenticeships fair will be virtual this year to respect Covid-19 guidelines and ensure as many people as possible can attend. Those wishing to register their interest should visit: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://ow.ly/PuRH50DPSLH"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;http://ow.ly/PuRH50DPSLH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin Smyth MP &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;added:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“My hope is that we can rebuild Bristol after the pandemic to be better than ever before. This means we cannot continue, as we have for the past 11 years, to waste the talents of our young people. We must redouble our efforts to make apprenticeships the highly-valued sources of education and employment they are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NHS Staff Pay 08/03/2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2021/03/11/nhs-staff-pay/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This week I raised the issue of NHS England staff pay with the UK Government&amp;#8217;s Minister for Social Care, who was left to answer urgent questions on this matter in the absence of the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health and social care staff across the UK have made incredible sacrifices throughout the course of the pandemic and so the announcement by the UK Government to raise NHS staff pay in England by a mere 1% highlights how out of touch this government is with the public and breaks promises made increase NHS staff pay in England by 2.1%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, health and social care staff in Scotland have already received a £500 one-off &amp;#8216;thank you&amp;#8217; payment from the Scottish Government in recognition of their hard work throughout the pandemic. In addition, a typical Band 5 nurse in Scotland already earns around £1000 more than their English counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Royal College of Nursing has warned that staff may leave the profession in England due to feeling &amp;#8216;undervalued&amp;#8217; in their work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With an ageing population and rising demand on services, it is vital that new staff are recruited and existing staff are retained across the health and social care setting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can watch my full contribution to the debate here: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLIPWhUprNY"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLIPWhUprNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="08/03 NHS Staff Pay" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLIPWhUprNY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Dr Philippa Whitford MP&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal for a mere 1% pay rise suggests this Government do not value the risks taken and sacrifices made by health and care staff throughout the pandemic, nor the challenge that they will face to clear the backlog. Like their initial refusal to extend free school meals, it also shows the Government are out of touch with the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a workforce crisis before the pandemic, does the Minister really believe that such a mean award will help recruit and retain healthcare staff? Senior band 5 nurses in England already earn up to £1,000 less than their Scottish counterparts, while the removal of the nursing bursary and imposition of tuition fees has saddled recently qualified nurses with up to £50,000 of debt. I am sure the Minister knows that shops do not accept claps instead of cash. Will this Government not give health and social care staff a decent pay rise and consider a one-off thank you payment, as in Scotland?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Minister Whately&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am somewhat surprised by the language the hon. Lady used around 1%, because a 1% pay rise for this large number of staff will cost around three quarters of a billion pounds. She should remember that this all has to be paid for in the context of, sadly, around three quarters of a million people losing their jobs through the pandemic, while others are&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-03-08/debates/6F02EA41-47D3-420F-A2B8-319A27E82340/NHSStaffPay#"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;seeing pay cuts or reduced hours. We are in a time of huge economic uncertainty, but while much of the public sector is going to have a pay freeze, the NHS workforce is going to have a pay rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Preet encourages Edgbaston to complete Census 2021</title>

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, has today called on her constituents and all residents right across Birmingham to ask that they take part in Census 2021.</p>
<p>The census, which has been happening for over 200 years, will ask questions about every household to build a picture of British society. It also helps the Government by providing them with information so that informed decisions can be made around funding and service requirements for local areas. </p>
<p>For example, the last census in 2011 showed that in Edgbaston there were 39,709 households; 1,925 families with three or more dependent children and just over 14% of the local population declaring themselves retired. This information has guided the Government, Birmingham City Council and the West Midlands Combined Authority for the last decade on decision-making around how many new homes were needed to be built in Bartley Green, how many school places were necessary in Quinton and what healthcare requirements there were in Harborne.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “It’s imperative that everyone completes the census. Not only will it help to inform local government but it is your opportunity to stand up and be counted. To play your part and help get public organisations put the right services in place, for your local community.”</p>
<p>Census Day is on Sunday 21 March, but households will now be receiving letters. Census 2021 will be digital first. This means that letters will be posted to houses with access codes that explain how to complete the forms online. However, paper copies can be requested if that is preferred.</p>
<p>Gill continued, “With the move by the ONS to make the census digital first, it’s even  easier this year to complete. You can fill it in on your phone, tablet or laptop and it should only take you about ten minutes.”</p>
<p>Language support is available by calling freephone 0800 587 2021 and for any further questions, please visit <a href="http://www.census.gov.uk/">www.census.gov.uk</a></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2021/03/6655-worcester-jobs-backed-by-exports/"><![CDATA[<p>New research released today (March 10) estimates nearly 6.5 million jobs in the UK are supported by exports, including 12.8% of jobs in Worcester. The report lifts the lid on the value of exporting-led jobs to the UK economy and helps inform the discussion around the untapped exporting potential of businesses across the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluating-the-impact-of-exports-on-uk-jobs-and-incomes">This ground-breaking research</a> estimates that median wages in jobs directly and indirectly supported by exports were around 7% higher than the national median and that more jobs (3.7 million) are supported by exports to the rest of the world than to the EU (2.8 million). The Office for National Statistics also estimates that goods exporting businesses are 21% more productive than those who do not.<em> </em>It provides a clear rationale for pursuing an exports-led recovery from Covid and using trade liberalisation to boost strategic industries – such as services, tech and renewables – that are key to building back better from the pandemic.</p>
<p>The FAI research estimates the number of jobs supported by exports at a regional level. DIT is exploring how we could develop data that can provide similar insights at an even more local level.</p>
<p>An additional paper released today shows the number of jobs supported by nationally export intensive industries, broken down by constituency. This does not show how many jobs at the local level are export intensive, because local activity can vary significantly from the national average. But the information can act as a starter for a conversation until more granular estimates becomes available. <strong>It shows that in Worcester there were some 6655 jobs (12.8% of total) in industries that were export intensive at a national level in 2019. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The research is accompanied by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/board-of-trade-report-global-britain-local-jobs">a new Board of Trade report – <em>Global Britain, Local Jobs</em></a> – that prescribes a series of policy fixes to unlock the UK’s full exporting potential and propel a trade-led, jobs-led recovery from Covid-19. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boosting the UK’s role as a global hub for services and digital trade.</li>
<li>Pursuing new trade deals with large and fast-growing economies beyond Europe, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.</li>
<li>Greater support to help businesses internationalise, and adopt new export targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board – which is led by International Trade Secretary Liz Truss – argues the UK’s departure from the EU is an opportunity to deepen trade liberalisation and boost the role trade plays in the economy. It argues the UK should follow the likes of Australia, Singapore and New Zealand, who have all used trade liberalisation to spur growth and capture global market share.</p>
<p>The report advocates deeper trade ties with faster growing nations outside Europe, with 65% of the world’s middle classes set to be in the Asia-Pacific by 2030 and nearly 90% of world growth expected to be outside the EU in the next five years.</p>
<p>It recommends the UK ‘ride’ the digital and green waves, highlighting the UK’s comparative advantage in those industries, with the exporting potential of the green economy set to be £170bn per year by 2030, and argues the UK should lead the charge for a more modern, fair and green WTO by working with like-minded allies on issues like industrial subsidies.</p>
<p>The report is being launched at a virtual Board of Trade meeting this morning, hosted by Truss, and will be sent to MPs and Parliamentarians. It comes ahead of next week’s publication of the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign policy, which will set out the strategy for expanding free and fair trade and making our domestic supply chains more resilient in order to drive prosperity in the UK and around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Local MP for Worcester Robin Walker said:</strong></p>
<p>“Over the last year businesses have been faced with the dual challenges of Covid and adapting to new trading conditions outside the European Union. It is therefore welcome news that the work the Department for International Trade has been doing to build trading relationships with our partners overseas has helped protect jobs and businesses across the UK, including here in Worcester.</p>
<p>“Worcester has some major manufacturers who export globally including Mazak, Southtech, and GTech, whose quality products show great British engineering around the world.</p>
<p>“I hope that as we continue to strengthen ties with our friends and allies around the world we continue to support exporters and protect jobs here.”</p>
<p><strong>Liz Truss, International Trade Secretary, said:</strong></p>
<p>“This report shows how Global Britain will deliver jobs and growth across the UK, particularly in areas like the north-west and north-east of England. Export-led jobs are more productive and higher paying, but currently too few businesses export and our economy would benefit from being more international. This potential can be liberated through more trade deals, boosting our role as global hub for digital and services trade, and by pursuing policies that drive an exports-led recovery.</p>
<p>“The opportunity we have as an independent trading nation is huge. Today’s report outlines how we can do things differently and capitalise on defining trends like the emergence of Asia’s middle classes and rapid growth in the Indo-Pacific.”</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It’s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your generosity in this debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may have been a little hard to determine from the remarks by my immediate predecessor in this debate, the right hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), he welcomed this debate and I join him in doing so. I congratulate the hon. Member for Bristol North West (Darren Jones) on his opening remarks. He is right that there is a consensus across the House. We all want to see COP26 as a hugely successful conference, not just for the UK but for the whole world, to set us on a path to zero emissions by 2050, an ambition that was set out some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objectives for the COP26 series of discussions, which of course were due to have taken place last year had it not been for covid, were actually set at Paris five years ago. It is worth reminding ourselves, at the outset of my remarks, of the four particular commitments that were set for the forthcoming conference. The first was to enhance Governments’ nationally determined contributions. This will be the first time since Paris that they will have been ratcheted up. The second was to invite each country to provide a long-term strategy, to give a pathway to decarbonisation by 2050. Where I agree with the right hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington is that it is beholden on the Government to set out clarity over the path to 2050, not just the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third commitment was to do with finance. There was $100 billion per annum mobilised for the poorest countries to help them green their economies and adapt to the impact of climate change. We need to see how that is going to be delivered when we get to Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was the issue of the rulebook for a global carbon market to avoid double counting and to set the standards. Here, I think the UK has a great opportunity to show its famed global leadership. This conference will be the largest ever held in this country in terms of the number of countries participating, and I hope that most of them will be able to be here, in one form or another, in person. It is a real opportunity for the nation to lead the world and for the Prime Minister to put his stamp on the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK is acting as host country—with Italy, as has been said—we will act as a neutral arbiter in these negotiations. We need to ensure that every country—every Paris signatory, at least—is supported in bringing forward its updated nationally determined contribution. At the beginning of the Paris conference, 186 of the 196 parties attending had presented their nationally determined contributions. I know that progress has been made, but we have a long way to go to match France’s performance when it hosted the last of this series of conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK announced its contribution, a 68% reduction in emissions against the 1990 benchmark, last December. Several other countries have set out high-profile ambitions since, including China, Japan and South Korea looking to get to net zero by the mid-21st century, and some presenting nearer-term targets ahead of COP26. However, we still have to see progress from some major economies, including Russia, Brazil and Australia—and I know that the US will now be joining; we need to see where it gets to, too. Perhaps the COP26 President will update us on his discussions with President Biden’s special envoy, John Kerry, who was in the UK very recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to touch on two other aspects—first, how does Parliament engage in scrutinising progress? The Environmental Audit Committee—in common with other Committees, as we have heard—has undertaken various sessions in relation to COP26. The first was a year ago, when we engaged with stakeholders who were involved with previous COPs to establish what the Government’s preparations needed to focus on. We then had a session with Nigel Topping and Fiona Reynolds in May last year on the role of finance in leading the way for the upcoming COP, and we also questioned Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN convention, last year. We questioned my right hon. Friend the COP26 President, who was then President-designate, in September last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine Select Committees have locus in relation to this issue, and we have all agreed to work together in scrutinising the UK Government preparations. We, as the Environmental Audit Committee, will lead the first of those scrutiny sessions, on cross-Government arrangements and the machinery of government, tomorrow morning. I am very pleased that my right hon. Friend the COP26 President will be attending, with two of his senior officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eyes of the world will be on us to make a credible success of COP. The challenge is across many areas. We need to use the national events that we have to demonstrate UK leadership. The UK has met the first and second carbon budgets and has already reduced emissions below the level expected in the third carbon budget, up to 2022. However, as is widely acknowledged, we are not on track to meet either the fourth or fifth carbon budgets, which were legislated for on the basis of an 80% cut in emissions using the 1990 baseline by 2050, rather than the more ambitious net zero target that we now have in legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major ramp-up is needed, as is acknowledged by the Committee on Climate Change, to achieve that, and the UK will have to make more progress. Although it has been succeeding in the power sector, emissions are either not falling or not falling fast enough across transport, agriculture, housing and industry. Bringing forward the petrol and diesel car ban is welcome, but it is not the only measure that the Government have to take&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-03-10/debates/e2a0d90e-ef5c-4114-963e-acee3b96952a/CommonsChamber#contribution-A036E615-543D-4D5D-B374-057B18237EEA"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, virtually met the Principal, Mike Welsh, and Vice Principal, Helen Wooldridge, of East Riding College to hear about their remote learning success story.</p>
<p>Since the first lockdown, staff have been teaching their full timetables and delivering live lessons to their students. They have been able to ensure connectivity, through broadband packages they have been gifted, and supply devices to all students who need them, emphasising that demand for devices has increased throughout the three lockdowns. They have an impressive 90%+ engagement and attendance of their students.</p>
<p>Staff have levelled up their skill set to use the technology appropriately and adapt their teaching and learning strategies – 92% of staff rated their use of Microsoft Teams as excellent and 97% of students agreed the teaching on their course was good.</p>
<p>Mike and Helen pride themselves on the high level and well-rounded support they continue to offer their students. Staff have kept in regular contact with all students, particularly those on their radar for safeguarding reasons. Staff have also received specialist training to support the prevalent mental health issues they are more commonly seeing.  </p>
<p>They have spent their catch-up funding from the Government on delivering one-to-one learning, which has primarily been focused on students who did not reach the grades needed in GCSE English and Maths. This targeted intervention has led to their best November resit results.</p>
<p>Graham also heard about their dedicated testing centres on their Beverley and Bridlington campuses, run by volunteers from their existing staff cohort, and their new online booking system for learners who have been welcomed back this week.  </p>
<p>Graham said, “It was great to have a catch up with Mike and Helen to hear about their impressive remote learning provision. I want to congratulate them for their fantastic performance during the pandemic, which they were able to deliver to their students instantly from day one. I look forward to visiting East Riding College next month to visit the building site of their new Institute of Technology.”</p>
<p>Mike said, “It was excellent to have the opportunity to share our very positive narrative with Graham and we look forward to welcoming him in April to show him the construction work that is underway for our new Yorkshire and Humber Institute of Technology.”</p>

    <title>Dear Newcastle March 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/03/dear-newcastle-march-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Dear Newcastle  March 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lockdown feels longer and harder. Perhaps it is the short days, perhaps it is the lack of certainty as to how we will get out of it, or the lack of support for so many business and individuals impacted or isolating. But we are making progress and there is hope! Newcastle cases per 100,000 are now below 70, from a peak of over 250 after Christmas and 500  in September. Newcastle has also been highly successful at rolling out the vaccine  with really good reports of getting the jab from our vaccine centres and travelling vaccine buses!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget was  a huge disappointment, seeming designed more to shore up Tory votes than set us on the road to economic recovery.  Extending Covid19 support till September was welcome but there was almost nothing for those excluded by existing support schemes.  Those who have sacrificed so much on the NHS frontline will see an effective cut, there was no mention of Care workers, there will be further cuts for  public services, effective tax rises for poor workers. And absolutely nothing for Newcastle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Backbench and Constituency Role&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I held a Constituency Town Hall for those Excluded from Covid 19 support which gave us a real insight into the challenges businesses are facing during this pandemic, many excluded from any support. I wrote to the Chancellor to ask him how he intended to support them but have yet to have a response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am now planning to hold a Student’s Town Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government announced its plan to come out of lockdown, but it leaves many questions unanswered. Still we look forward to a gradual easing of restrictions – and hopefully of casework!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed  suggestions for Digital policies for agreement with Jo and Nicola, and then with LOTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I chaired Parliamentary Export Programme Webinar with Department of International trade and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding issues and demands for the extension of the furlough scheme, as well as issues regarding rollout and regional data regarding COVID-19 vaccines,  availability of testing data and resources to local authorities, challenging the digital divide, financial support for individuals and businesses facing ongoing COVID-19 disruption and restrictions in the North-East, health and safety precautions for health and safety of Royal Mail staff and the Horizon scandal. I have contacted numerous members of the Cabinet with questions that arose as a result of the Digital Town Hall I attended. I have been in contact with Members of Congress Jeff Fortenberry &amp;amp; Ron Kind regarding my involvement in the British American Parliamentary Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Shadow Ministerial and PES Role&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Telecoms Infrastructure Bill finally came back to Parliament following a longer then expected sojourn in the House of Lords – the Government was afraid it would lose a vote on a humans rights amendment so would not bring it back until that possibility had been  safely dealt with elsewhere. Government effectively accepted two of our amendments on the Bill  but refused to provide for open, transparent reporting on telecoms infrastructure progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government announced its new ARIA science funding institution but without setting out what its objectives will be!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Online Safety Bill as it is now expected to be included in the Queens Speech and then go through pre-legislative scrutiny with the result that we will be lucky to see the Bill before the end of the Parliamentary Year. That is almost three years after its consultation on online harms and a decade after online harms were a recognised issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are in the process of drafting our own Our Digital Future Report Report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>MP urges constituents to check if they are eligible for Pension Credit</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is calling on constituents to check if they are eligible for Pension Credit and not to miss out on a vital financial boost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id="3337" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/?attachment_id=3337" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg" data-orig-size="2276,2298" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1.9&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;SM-A202F&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1613062740&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;3.6&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;200&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0.02&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="20210211_165902" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=297" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=1014" alt="" class="wp-image-3337" srcset="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=1014 1014w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=2028 2028w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=150 150w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=297 297w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20210211_165902.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil is supporting the campaign by the charity Independent Age calling on the UK Government to create an action plan to increase the uptake of Pension Credit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “I would urge constituents to check whether they are eligible for Pension Credit because statistics show that many who are eligible are not claiming it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Only 63% of those eligible are currently claiming it so please ensure you do not miss out on support which is available to you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pension Credit, a benefit designed to keep the least well-off pensioners out of poverty, is currently being received by just six in 10 (63%) of those who should be receiving it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research from the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, commissioned and published by Independent Age, has found that the low take-up is creating significant knock-on effects for the NHS and social care, costing taxpayers an estimated £4 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This bill to the taxpayer is significantly higher than the annual cost of giving pensioners up to £1.8 billion to which they are entitled but are not receiving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those missing out on Pension Credit are also more likely to need social care – whether residential or home-based – which incurs additional costs to the state of between £66 million and £189 million per year. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report concluded that if Pension Credit take-up was lifted from 61% to 100%, then almost 450,000 pensioners could be lifted out of poverty, reducing pensioner poverty to its lowest ever level, and resulting in substantial savings to the NHS and social care systems over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Independent Age is calling for the Government to put in place an ambitious, publicly available action plan detailing how it will work to increase the uptake of Pension Credit over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claim online or call 0800 99 1234.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nottingham City Council Budget 2021/22</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/03/08/nottingham-city-council-budget-2021-22/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham Labour will agree a package of budget proposals to establish a sustainable financial footing amid the Covid crisis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This budget comes during an extremely difficult time for the people of Nottingham, the nation as a whole and the council. The impacts of Covid have been devastating. The health effects coupled with the economic situation has dealt a blow to many of our residents. During this most difficult time for our City the council has stepped up to support our most vulnerable residents and taken on new responsibilities ranging from getting every rough sleeper into safe accommodation to administering tens of millions of pounds worth of business grants to help small employers through the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham City Council has had to make over £271m of budget savings between 2010/11 and 2019/20, and during the current pandemic has had to deal with £25.9m unreimbursed Covid response costs and loss of income. We are having to take difficult decisions in this budget which includes £15.6m of savings.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Proposals include some service changes, as well as a workforce reduction of 272 full-time equivalent posts – 109 of which have been held vacant. We will also be implementing the Government’s proposed 3% social care precept towards the rising costs of care services for elderly and vulnerable adults, which now accounts for over 35% of the council’s net budget.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last couple of months we have been listening to the feedback on draft budget proposals and will be making a few changes as a result. We will be:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrapping the staffing reduction to the Missing Children’s Team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrapping the proposed 30p charge for public toilets in the City.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing the grants to arts and cultural venues with a much smaller 15% funding reduction rather than the 37% that had been considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many proposals in today’s budget that we are bringing reluctantly. To avoid similar decisions in the future we need the Government to change course.  We will be using Full Council today to call on the Government to urgently address a number of issues which will be significant for the Council’s budget and financial stability over the coming years including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The need to bring forward the promised Green Paper on Adult Social Care with a funding model that does not rely on continued increases in Council tax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services for vulnerable children where provider pricing nationally is spiralling – Nottingham City Council is facing an estimated additional cost pressure of more than £12m over the coming year&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further support for  businesses and employment services which will be&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

              <p>Over the past week Jon Cruddas MP for Dagenham and Rainham has been contacted by a number of concerned residents regarding the recent spate of dognapping incidents in the area.</p>
              <p>As a dog owner Jon Cruddas MP shares the concerns raised by constituents and has been liaising with the local police to ascertain how prolific reports of dognapping are across Dagenham and Rainham. Residents have alleged that the Rush Green area, among others has been targeted.</p>
              <p><strong>Jon said:</strong> “these reports are very worrying, especially given the nature of some of the allegations which suggest pets being taken in the street. As a dog owner I know just how much our pets mean to us, so I am urging residents across the constituency to be aware and remain vigilant.”</p>
              <p>In the coming days Jon and his team expect to be updated by the police with figures and details of incidents in the constituency. Following this Jon will be working to ensure that all routes are explored to prevent these crimes in the future.</p>
              <p><strong>Jon added:</strong> “my constituents should not be in a position where they are fearful of taking the dog for a walk, and I will certainly be following this up. To help me get a clearer picture of the issue I hope residents will take the time to fill in the short survey on my website.”</p>

<p>RISHI Sunak has vowed to tackle the dominance of tech giants such as Facebook and Google by ensuring they pay a fair rate of tax and do not abuse their market position to squash rivals.</p>



<p>In the wake of his £65billion raid on household incomes and company profits in Wednesday&#8217;s Budget, the Chancellor is preparing to set out plans on March 23, which is being called tax day&#8217;, to fill the £407billion hole left by the pandemic.</p>



<p>Among the options is an online sales tax&#8217; targeting the explosion in internet shopping triggered by the crisis, which has benefited companies such as Amazon at the expense of traditional high street stores.</p>



<p>Mr Sunak said he was talking to the US and other members of the G7 to tackle the ruses used by the companies to limit their tax bills.</p>



<p>The Chancellor added: One of my priorities in the G7 this year, which I&#8217;ve already started work on, is to try to get international agreement on a new way to tax these companies. I spend a lot of time talking to my finance minister colleagues around the world about this issue.&#8217; A Treasury source added that President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration had signalled an openness to engage constructively in the debate and try to reach resolution on it&#8217;, with hopes rising that an agreement will be reached this year.</p>



<p>Mr Sunak is studying a review by Tory MP&nbsp;<strong>John Penrose</strong>&nbsp;of the laws meant to prevent big businesses becoming monopolies that can dictate prices and smother rivals.</p>



<p>Mr Penrose said Ministers needed to introduce a parliamentary Act to update Britain&#8217;s consumer institutions to reflect the rise of the digital economy, with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) regulator tasked with devising a way to allow customers to compare the price&#8217; of free online services. Companies such as Google and Facebook do not charge customers for many of their services &#8211; instead they gather customers&#8217; data as their fee&#8217; because it allows adverts to be more precisely targeted.</p>



<p>A Treasury source said the companies were not well captured by our current approach to competition regulation&#8217;, and reform was needed, adding: What we currently have in place and what hasn&#8217;t been in place is that we&#8217;re not perfectly equipped to deal with the dominance these businesses have.&#8217;</p>



<p>Last month, Lord Rothermere, chairman of The Mail on Sunday&#8217;s parent company, DMGT, condemned the Australian government for watering down laws forcing tech giants to pay for news. Describing it as a bad day for democracy&#8217;, he said it would let Facebook decide what news is read on social media and how much, if anything, it pays for it&#8217;.</p>



<p>He said politicians in democracies worldwide must decide if they will let tech giants choose what news the public sees in secret deals with the publishers they favour&#8217; or act to ensure fair and transparent treatment for all&#8217;.</p>



<p>In a letter to the Financial Times, Lord Rothermere wrote: Reporting news costs money; but for years Facebook and Google have plundered news content without paying for it while at the same time extracting ever greater profits from advertising markets they dominate.&#8217; Referring to Australia, he added: A nation was held to ransom &#8211; and it surrendered.&#8217;</p>



<p>Politicians and officials around the world are becoming increasingly worried about the economic dominance of the tech titans.</p>



<p>Google receives around 90 per cent of all advertising spending by companies who want to display their products and services on internet search result pages. That brings the company revenues of around £7?billion a year in Britain alone &#8211; but it pays UK taxes on just a fraction of its earnings. Facebook has around half of the entire market for display advertising, worth around £5?billion a year.</p>



<p>The CMA found last year that Google and Facebook were able to demand inflated prices for adverts, pushing costs to suppliers that were passed on as higher prices.</p>

This Budget has one overriding aim—to kick-start our economy, which shrank by 10% last year. We are now set to borrow a peacetime record of £355 billion this year. This is jaw-dropping, I agree, as is the fact that 700,000 people…</div>

    <title>High Speed Rail Bridge Consultation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://liambyrne.co.uk/high-speed-rail-bridge-consultation/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;img width="150" height="150" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HS2-image-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important information about new High Speed (HS2) bridges at Saltley viaduct and the Aston Church Road&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I need your help putting forward views about two new bridges being built for HS2 &lt;strong&gt;at Saltley Viaduct and the Aston Church Road, as they will cut road links for a year, beginning in mid-2022.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the new High Speed 2 rail line is a game changer for our area. A train journey to Manchester will take just 41 minutes and a trip to London will take 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is expected to create jobs, jobs, jobs: thousands of new jobs around the new station at Birmingham International &amp;#8211; and thousands more in the city centre &amp;#8211; plus up to 3,600 jobs at the new business park I’ve fought for at the old LDV-Alstom site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, building the line will cause disruption not least because the bridges at Saltley Viaduct and Aston Church Road have to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lot of work has already gone into replacement plans and timing of the construction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can fill in the consultation survey online by going to&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/HS2-Saltley-KDE/
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or if you don’t have the internet call the freephone number on 08081 434 434.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to check out the new HS2 Jobs Board https://www.hs2.org.uk/supply-chain-jobs&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve battled hard over five years in Parliament to make sure HS2 works for us. This is a big bit of new infrastructure for us and I’m anxious we get it right. So please make sure you have your say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welwyn Hatfield MP Receives First Dose Of COVID-19 Vaccination</title>

				&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local MP and Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps thanks NHS staff and volunteers as he urges people: ‘when you get the call for your vaccine- go and get it’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Shapps MP yesterday attended the vaccination centre at the University of Hertfordshire College Lane Campus in Hatfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre caters for 4 different GP surgeries in Hatfield and currently vaccinates around 350 people per day. The centre is organised so that people are vaccinated by the staff from their own GP surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps becomes the first cabinet minister to have received a jab for the coronavirus, having had treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma 21 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival, Mr Shapps took a lateral flow test to make sure he was not bringing COVID into the vaccination centre. He spoke to volunteers and staff outside the centre before entering to have his first dose, and tour the centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving the jab, Mr Shapps said: “I received my call from the GP surgery to come for my first vaccination- actually I was so surprised to receive the call I actually called back and checked they got it right. Turns out that it’s because a couple of decades ago I had cancer and have been in remission for a very long time from that- but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to have my jab and then have a little tour to thank the volunteers and NHS staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing is this: when you’re called for your jab, make sure you book it in and make sure you go and get it, and together we can protect each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps released a video on the day of his vaccination, which can be viewed below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five years on: The health effects of the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Act on Children and Disabled People</title>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>A new report by a cross party group of MPs as part of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Health in All Policies which I Chair has concluded that, five years on, the effect of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/7/contents/enacted">Welfare Reform &amp; Work Act 2016</a> has been ‘devastating’ to the health and wellbeing of people on low incomes.</p>
<p>The report which was launched today <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf"> can be read here.</a></p>
<p>This<a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf"> report</a> shows there is strong evidence from several sources that the cuts in social security support have contributed to increasing poverty and financial hardship in low income households which has particularly affected the poverty levels of children and disabled people.</p>
<p>The analysis has found overwhelming evidence showing how the Act has pushed many low income households into poverty and financial hardship, disproportionately affecting children and disabled people. The report describes the strong evidence showing the adverse causal relationship that this poverty has had on the health and well-being of those affected, particularly children, with every 1% increase in child poverty associated with an extra 5.8 infant deaths per 100,000 and a third of the increases in infant mortality between 2014 and 2017 attributed to rising poverty.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf">report</a> also reveals how the treatment of those people reliant on social security by the Department for Work and Pensions often leaves them feeling worthless and even ‘dehumanised’.</p>
<p>Looking at 5 specific measures within the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Act – the benefit cap, the benefit freeze, the two child limit, the abolition of £30 a week support for disabled people who were unfit for work (ESA WRAG) and the extension of sanctions to ‘responsible carers’ (parents of pre-nursery age children) – the APPG inquiry sought to identify the impacts of  these specific measures on household income and the impact that this may have on the behaviour and health of claimants and their families in the context of the 2012 social security cuts, and other wider ranging tax and public service changes.</p>
<p>The APPG also looked at the Government’s objectives for the 2016 Act to see how effective the measures had been in achieving these objectives and has made 16 recommendations including</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the social safety net sufficient for people not in full-time work to receive a minimum income for healthy living</li>
<li>Making permanent the £1,000-a-year increase in the standard allowance for Universal Credit</li>
<li>Removing sanctions and reduce conditionalities in benefit payments</li>
<li>Eradicating benefit caps and lifting the two-child limit</li>
<li>Providing tapering levels of benefits to avoid cliff edges</li>
<li>Ending the five-week wait for Universal Credit and providing cash grants for low-income households</li>
<li>Giving sufficient Government support to food aid providers and charities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2015 we looked at the <em>potential</em> impacts of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill on child poverty and health, and we wanted to compare these with the <em>actual</em> impacts. Again the focus was on the relationship between poverty, inequality and health, and in particular child health. (Read the APPG’s earlier report <a href="https://www.fph.org.uk/media/1374/appg-health-in-all-policies-inquiry-into-child-poverty-and-health2.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.)</p>
<p>Five years on, we have conducted a follow-up review of the actual impacts of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016.</p>
<p>There is a growing evidence base of the direct and negative impacts of different aspects of the social security system on the mental and physical health of claimants and their families, in addition to the indirect impacts mediated by poverty as a result of having inadequate income from work and/or social security support.</p>
<p>In addition to quantitative evidence we looked at qualitative studies which pointed to a process of ‘dehumanising’ claimants that eroded their self-esteem and confidence, making them feel worthless. In some cases, the whole experience had proved too much for some claimants and they have taken their own lives.</p>
<p>It’s important to note the knock-on impact that this ill health will have on health services and for social protection to be recognised as mitigating against socio-economic health risk factors.</p>
<p>Although the Government achieved their aim of cutting welfare spending by introducing these measures – working age spending on social security has shrunk by £34bn since 2010 – there has been minimal impact on helping to get people into work who wouldn’t have got into work without these measures.”</p>
<p><a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf">The full report</a> was launched with a panel of speakers to discuss the findings and recommendations of the report including:</p>
<p>Professor Clare Bambra, University of Newcastle</p>
<p>Helen Barnard, Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p>
<p>Ellen Clifford, Disabled People Against Cuts</p>
<p>Professor David Taylor Robinson, University of Liverpool</p>
<p>Geoff Fimister, Disability Benefits Consortium</p>
<p>‘Aurora’ (not her real name) – a widowed parent of two children</p>
<p><strong>‘Aurora’</strong> said: “Our situation has been greatly impacted by the changes to the benefits system. We can no longer afford the essentials to ensure even a basic standard of living. After rent and deductions are paid there is nothing left. I do not feel supported by the DWP, and I feel our group have been ignored. The pandemic highlights a desperate requirement for reform.</p>
<p>“We need help to participate and become productive members of society. It is our children who invariably suffer, poverty has lasting effects, they bare the consequences of these policies.”</p>
<p><strong>Helen Barnard, JRF Director</strong>, said: “In the last year, millions more people have turned to social security to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The importance of a strong social security system to act as an anchor for all of us, preventing us being swept into poverty by unexpected events, illness or job loss has never been clearer.  This APPG report demonstrates starkly the damage done to individuals, families and communities by weakening social security.</p>
<p>As we look forward to the easing of the public health emergency, we must learn the lessons of the pandemic and of previous recessions and ensure that social security is strengthened. There is a long way to go before the economic storm passes; the government must live up to the promise of bringing us through that storm safely, starting by keeping the £20 uplift to Universal Credit and extending it to those on legacy benefits who have been unjustly excluded from additional support so far.</p>
<p><strong>Professor David Taylor-Robinson, University of Liverpool</strong>, said: “Even before covid-19, extremely disturbing trends in health were emerging in England. Growing child poverty, homelessness, and food poverty led to an unprecedented rise in infant mortality, mental health problems, and stalling life expectancy, especially for women in the poorest areas and cities. These were the same areas where 10 years of austerity measures had hit the poorest groups the hardest.</p>
<p>“The APPG report shows how reductions in social security for families with children have hit the most vulnerable communities. In addition larger cuts in government funding to local authorities with higher proportions of children in poverty have meant a reduction in spending on vital preventive services in areas where they were needed most.</p>
<p>“We know that rising child poverty has myriad adverse impacts on multiple aspects of child health and development that will have repercussions for decades to come. It is time for the government to reverse these extremely concerning trends, establishing a welfare system that protects children from poverty and material deprivation.”</p>
<p><strong>Geoff Fimister, Policy Co-Chair, Disability Benefits Consortium</strong>, said: “As the economic fallout from the Covid crisis threatens to make life even tougher for disabled people, in or out of work – and as the Chancellor prepares his Budget and the Government proposes to announce details of its disability strategy later this year – this important report could hardly be more timely. It sets out clearly the impacts of austerity on disabled people and the measures needed to set a new direction and start to put things right.</p>
<p>The Disability Benefits Consortium is a network of more than 100 organisations concerned with achieving real social security for disabled people. We gave evidence to this inquiry – based on our research and on feedback from our members – and are very pleased to see such clear and well-founded analysis and  recommendations. We hope that the Government will take notice.”</p>
<p><strong>Professor Clare Bambra of Newcastle University</strong> commented: “Our results show the importance to protecting people’s mental health of adequate social safety nets. This is particularly relevant now as the lock down and the COVID-19 pandemic is already leading to deteriorations in people’s mental health. Our research suggests that the current increase to Universal Credit of £20 per week should be maintained in order to protect the mental health of the most vulnerable in our society.”</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Clifford, </strong><strong>Disabled People Against Cuts</strong>, said: “I very much welcome the report launched today. Since 2010, extensive work has been undertaken by Disabled People’s Organisations, charities, academics and journalists to investigate, document and research the disproportionate impacts of welfare reform measures on those with the lowest incomes in society including disabled people. Interrogating and reflecting upon that wide evidence-base, the APPG has produced a stark report that succeeds in cutting through the spin and selective use of figures to present a hard-hitting portrait of Britain today. We are the sixth richest country in the world and yet infant mortality is rising and life expectancy declining. The Resolution Foundation calculated that by 2022, the total annual savings in spending for working age social security claimants from 2010 would be £34billion.</p>
<p>“In December 2020, the Marmot Review and analysis into the UK’s “high and unequal” Covid-19 death toll exposed key causes of this as existing poverty and inequalities driven by 10 years of austerity including social security cuts. Even after the £20 per week Universal Credit uplift, benefit claimants are receiving just 43.4% of the minimum income standard (MIS), which is the amount required for an acceptable standard of living. For those still on legacy benefits who have never been granted an uplift, their incomes are just 33.9% of the MIS. Many of these are disabled people, many have been shielding for over a year now and have seen their expenditures rise sharply as a result. The Disability Benefits Consortium recently published findings showing that 66% of disabled people on legacy benefits surveyed are having to choose between eating or heating.</p>
<p>“The news that the Universal credit uplift is set to continue for a further six months is welcome, but we need to urgently pressure the government into extending the uplift to legacy benefits. There is no question that the failure to do so has been detrimental to disabled people’s health and I echo the report recommendation calling for research into the long-term health effects of different social security levels to be carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions in conjunction with the Department for Health and Social Care. Ultimately what we need is a new social security system, one that provides a genuine safety net for all and that guarantees a decent standard of living. Only then will we begin to see a reversal of the regressive health and inequality trends of the past decade.”</p>

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus &#8211; support for local businesses &amp; high streets:</span></strong></p>
<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>
<p>I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement of the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of April 2021, and the extension of the business loan schemes until the end of March.

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>Welcoming the Fantastic Ryanair Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianpaisleymp.co.uk/2016/01/11/welcoming-the-fantastic-ryanair-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br/>
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br/>
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br/>
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br/>
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br/>
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br/>
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br/>
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br/>
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
