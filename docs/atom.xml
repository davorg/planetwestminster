              <p>Tomorrow (Saturday 26 June) marks Armed Forces Day. This year the day falls against a backdrop of uncertainty for our veterans and current service personnel as the Armed Forces Bill passes through Parliament. Last year the Labour Party launched ‘Labour Friends of the Forces’ and this year stands firmly behind our Armed Forces, campaigning for:</p>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>-</strong> The Armed Forces Covenant to be fully enshrined in law,</li>
                    <li><strong>-</strong> a duty of care from MoD to provide veterans with better legal and mental health support,</li>
                    <li><strong>-</strong> better rights to compensation when injured overseas,</li>
                    <li><strong>-</strong> a three-year national insurance holiday for companies employing veterans,</li>
                    <li><strong>-</strong> improved Armed Forces housing stock and better access to social housing options.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>To find out more about the work of Labour Friends of the Forces visit their website: <strong><a href="https://www.labourforces.org/">https://www.labourforces.org/</a></strong></p>
              <p>This year in response to the Armed Forces Bill, and the build up to Armed Forces Day Labour have set up a survey to find out what support is needed to help service men and women transition back into civilian life. If you have served in the Armed Forces or are currently serving, please take a moment to fill out the short survey here: <strong><a href="https://action.labour.org.uk/page/84779/data/1">https://action.labour.org.uk/page/84779/data/1</a></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> <em>“The community across Dagenham and Rainham has a proud and celebrated service history. Armed Forces Day provides us with a chance to remember and thank those who have served, are serving, and the families of service personnel whose loved ones make huge sacrifices to keep Britain safe every day.</em></p>
              <p>
                <em>“The pandemic has also been a reminder of our Armed Forces continual value to society. From setting up test centres to delivering PPE, they were on hand to support the nation. The Tories talk up their support for our forces, but now it falls on Labour to ensure they deliver.”</em>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Philip Dunne MP has welcomed an additional £220m of funding for Culture Recovery Fund grants, to support theatres, galleries, museums and other cultural organisations.</p>

<p>The funding will be divided into two grant funds, to support those organisations who are at imminent risk of failure due to the impact of the pandemic, and those who have previously received Culture Recovery Fund grants.</p>

<p>This will take the form of: an Emergency Resource Support Fund - open to organisations who are at risk of ceasing to trade viably within twelve weeks, and in particular, those who have not interacted with previous Culture Recovery Fund schemes to date; and a Continuity Support Fund, exclusively open to the more than 5,000 previous Culture Recovery Fund recipients, which will launch following the conclusion of the roadmap later this year.</p>

<p>The funds will be run by the Arts Council England, British Film Institute, and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, working with Historic England.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am pleased the government has announced a further £220m of cultural grant funding, taking total dedicated cultural support during the pandemic to over £2bn.</p>

<p>“We have benefitted in South Shropshire, with Ludlow Assembly Rooms, Ludlow Fringe, Stokesay Court, Creation Live Events, Upton Cressett Ltd, Arts Alive, and the Majestic Cinema in Bridgnorth all receiving grant funding in previous rounds.</p>

<p>“I am pleased that this funding ensures that if cultural organisations are at imminent risk of failure, there is a lifeline available. I am hopeful that the lifting of restrictions on 19th July will deliver the boost to events and cultural venues the industry so desperately needs.”</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up: 25 June 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/25/weekly-round-up-25-june-2021/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-25-june-2021" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had an update statement from the Ministry of Justice this week on the Rape Review, which turned out to be a shocking indictment of the widening gap between the Government’s rhetoric of being tough on crime and the miserable reality. Rape prosecutions and convictions are at record lows but the pitiful announcements of new funding are unlikely to improve these rates. Domestic violence and rape funding have been lumped in together, despite often being very different crimes, which shows a complete lack of understanding about the complexity and challenges in dealing with these difference offences. Funding for refuge accommodation is indeed welcome, but that will have no impact on the challenges in persuading people to come forward and report crimes to the police, in ensuring the police have the adequate specialised resources to investigate these crimes, in ensuring there is adequate funding to ensure that courts are able to manage the caseloads with sufficient numbers of staff, and above all, in educating those involved to ensure that outdated and offensive attitudes are consigned to the past. This Government is failing victims, it’s failing the police, it’s failing court staff, and it’s failing society. They must do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour are continuing to push the UK Government to implement the New Decade, New Approach Bill in Northern Ireland without delay to avoid prolonging political instability and risking the gains that have been made. The collapse in power-sharing in Northern Ireland in 2017, and the subsequent 3-year absence of power-sharing institutions was eventually resolved via the New Decade, New Approach agreement. The New Decade, New Approach agreement established a programme for government, outlined the way forward on contentious issues such as the Irish Language Act which had prevented the restarting of power-sharing, and agreed a series of measures to reform the sustainability of the institutions. This Bill enshrines the sustainability measures into law and should provide the basis for a more effective operation of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly. We in Labour believe these provisions represent a sensible evolution of the post-Belfast/Good Friday Agreement landscape that should promote greater stability and good governance, but the 18-month delay in bringing legislation forward has helped exacerbate the current political instability. The lack of urgency shown by this Government is unbelievable considering they are all well aware of the risks of extended political instability in Northern Ireland. We have a responsibility to the people of Northern Ireland to help restore good and sustainable governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of apprenticeships &amp;#8211; a subject close to my heart! &amp;#8211; returned to the House of Commons during a question session to the Department for Education this week. This Government continue to say how much they value apprenticeships and how important they are.  However, once again there is a huge gap between their rhetoric and their action. The numbers that they are talking about proudly are tiny, especially in comparison to those going on to higher education at university. In England in 2019/20 there were 322,500 apprenticeship starts, but 23,400 fewer participated in an apprenticeship overall than in the previous year. Attitudes are changing and more people are starting to recognise the value in apprenticeships but the Government must do more to support employers who have the skills and knowledge but lack the support to be able to contribute to apprenticeship schemes. We can build a society that values skills of all types and that recognises that education does not just happen in a classroom or a lecture hall.  Our economy will thrive when variety in education is supported and valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to meet with leaders at Bristol City Council and Cllr Helen Holland about the Healthier Together partnership with the local NHS this week, and the role of Local Authorities in the Government’s upcoming NHS Bill.  We need a care system that matches the challenges and the opportunities of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century; a care system that will help improve the health and wellbeing of everyone, that will ensure a better quality of care, and that can be financed sustainably. We are, as a population, living longer than previously, but we have pockets of deprivation that we need to close. Reducing health inequalities and ensuring equal access to the opportunities that support our health and wellbeing such as education around exercise and food will go a long way to support our care system and deal with the challenges it is facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday we mark Armed Forces Day, a day to consider the contribution of the Armed Forces to our society and to thank them for the work that they do. Deployments abroad have continued during Covid with support for humanitarian operations and training local forces to deal with the threats that they face. However we have also got used to seeing our service men and women far more in the UK – driving ambulances, building the Nightingale hospitals and supporting the testing and vaccination programme. Their expertise is to be valued and applauded and I thank each and every serviceman and woman who has supported the community here in Bristol South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are opportunities within my office, both in London and in Bristol South. I am looking for a &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/15/vacancy-personal-assistant/"&gt;Personal Assistant&lt;/a&gt; with excellent communication skills and experience of managing a complex diary to support my work in Westminster and a part-time &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/15/vacancy-caseworker/"&gt;Caseworker&lt;/a&gt; to join my constituency team in Bristol South. Closing date for applications is 5 July with a view to starting in the middle of August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preet puts exempt sector on notice </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-puts-exempt-sector-notice" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP has written to the 40 providers of exempt accommodation across the constituency of Edgbaston in Birmingham, putting those that offer substandard housing on notice. </p>
<p>Across Edgbaston alone, 40 providers run more than 280 properties supporting some of Birmingham’s most vulnerable residents. However, in the last three years provision of this type of housing has more than doubled, with the number of claimants increasing from 11,000 in 2018 to 22,500 today.  </p>
<p>In her letter to these providers, Gill writes that while exempt accommodation is a much-needed source of housing, with the quantity of provision exploding “my worry is that the standard of accommodation and support is not at the level which it needs to be.” While Birmingham needs this type of supported accommodation, if the property is not well-managed, it often attracts anti-social behaviour and crime which has a big impact on the local community. Drug dealing, theft and prostitution have all been seen to have begun in places where it had not been previously. </p>
<p>She goes on to say, “I have received hundreds of enquiries and complaints from those impacted by exempt providers who are not supplying suitable provision. One such instance was that of Saif Lodge. The property has been causing many issues in the area and has been taking up the already limited resources of public services. In this case, sufficient evidence was collated, and the court imposed an eight-week closure notice on the property.” </p>
<p>It is for this reason why Ms Gill has written to providers, urging them to sign up and comply with Birmingham’s new Quality Standard. The Standard aims to bring these varying levels of support and supervision across the city to one approved level of quality.  </p>
<p>Ms Gill concluded that, “Everyone deserves to live in a decent home whether that is in social housing, their own property or exempt provision. Where they are not, I will be progressing the case with the council, police and the regulator.” </p>

    <title>Time for the UK to tell the COP26 main players some home truths</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/06/25/time-for-the-uk-to-tell-the-cop26-main-players-some-home-truths/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>       There is a part of the UK establishment that is always keen to belittle and run the UK down, claiming we are small and unimportant now we have left the EU. They ignore the facts that we are the second biggest contributor to NATO, a member of the UN security Council, the fifth largest world economy, a member of the G7 and the  Commonwealth,  and an important influence on world events. This autumn sees the UK chairing the COP 26 Climate conference, shortly after we chaired the G7. </p>
<p>      There is however one important area where I agree with them that we are small and  not very important, and that is in the list of countries and regions that put out the most carbon dioxide. Ironically here the establishment seem to think it is the UK that has to do so much more, when all the figures show attention needs to be focussed on the Big three carbon generators, China, the USA and the EU. Between them they account for 52% of the world output compared to our 1%. In other words if the UK eliminated all its carbon dioxide output it would have the same effect on world figures as the Big 3 cutting their output by just 2%. </p>
<p>      China is still saying she intends to increase her massive carbon output further this decade before finding some ways to start to curb it. China needs to be challenged on her large and growing output. At 29% of world CO2 she is by far and away the biggest single source. If the UK eliminated all its CO2 that would not fully offset one recent year’s growth in output by China.  The USA has just experienced four years under a President dedicated to increasing US output and use of cheap fossil fuel energy. He successfully boosted US output of oil and gas to help power an industrial renaissance by onshoring investments that had gone abroad and expanding US output. The new President thinks this was a wrong policy but has yet to announce the ways in which he intends to redirect US activities. We await a detailed plan with timetables on how to get US people out of their internal combustion engines cars, eating less meat and putting in electric heating. The EU too has a similar issue. Germany remains wedded to a major car industry which largely sells diesel and petrol vehicles. The country burns a lot of coal and says it intends to keep coal in its power mix at least until 2035. How is this compatible with the EU’s aims? The EU is around one tenth of world carbon dioxide production. </p>
<p>      As Chairman of the Conference the UK needs to challenge the USA and EU  to produce timely and convincing plans of how they will achieve demanding targets as early as 2030 as it is difficult to see them hitting them on current policy. All major participants need to see  that if they do not get a much better offer from China and other leading emerging market countries world emissions will continue to grow. It is  not fair to close down our industries and power stations whilst others carry on churning out the CO2. </p>

  <summary type="text">Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has accused the Government of threatening the future of farming in the county, after it was revealed they are encouraging farmers to leave the industry without any plans to replace them.

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has accused the Government of threatening the future of farming in the county, after it was revealed they are encouraging farmers to leave the industry without any plans to replace them.</p>
<p>Last month the Government announced a new retirement scheme to support farmers who wish to leave the industry, freeing up land for new entrants.</p>
<p>However in response to a Written Parliamentary Question from Tim, the Farming Minister Victoria Prentis revealed that no analysis has actually been done on the number expected to take up the scheme, nor how many new entrants will replace them.</p>
<p>Instead, the Government just say that they "think" that new workers will enter the industry.</p>
<p>Tim said<em>: "This is massively concerning.</em></p>
<p><em>"Cumbria's farmers already face huge uncertainty thanks to the Conservatives' failure to protect animal welfare standards in the trade deal with Australia and the cuts to farm support payments without the replacement even being ready.</em></p>
<p><em>"Now the Government is actively encouraging farmers to leave the industry, with no idea who will replace them.</em></p>
<p><em>"But we know this isn't happening by accident. The Government's refusal to step in and save Newton Rigg agricultural college shows how little they care about the future of farming in places like Cumbria.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Conservatives have taken farmers for granted for too long - it's time they started listening to local farmers before there are none left to listen to".</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi forces Transport Minister to acknowledge the need for funding repairs on Tyne Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi questioned the Transport Minister on funding for the Tyne Bridge repairs. She asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What plans he has to improve transport links across the River Tyne?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stephenson MP initially said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is for local authorities in the area to promote any further improvements to local connectivity over the River Tyne”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi pressed the Minister to acknowledge the importance of this transport icon, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As well as being an icon of North East people, culture and engineering, the Tyne Bridge is an essential part of our Transport infrastructure and it’s in a dire state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister was forced to acknowledge the need for transport spending and the bids made (and being prepared) for much needed renovations of the Tyne Bridge. Chi tweeted a video of the exchange, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Minister thinks transport links across the Tyne are nothing to do w him. Perhaps thats why transport spending in #London is 2.5 times more per head than in the #North?  We need refurbishment of #TyneBridge to celebrate 100 years of this beautiful &amp;amp; critical transport icon”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chi’s interventions follows a letter from Newcastle Council which she signed along with other Tyneside MPs, the North of Tyne Mayor and the Police and Crime Commissioner on the need for bridge repairs: &lt;a href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/06/chi-signs-newcastle-council-letter-on-tyne-bridge-repairs/"&gt;https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/06/chi-signs-newcastle-council-letter-on-tyne-bridge-repairs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi also held a debate on the Tyne Bridge on Wednesday 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; June, where she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ The Tyne Bridge was last fully painted in 2000, and the  paint system is designed to last approximately 18-20 years – a new paint job is overdue, as well as repairs needed for the road deck, the towers, the stonework, the steelwork and the installation of a new drainage system.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ The Government makes much of its ‘levelling up’ agenda and yet the North seems to be forgotten when it comes to celebrating our communities. I have raised with the Department for Business and for Trade that they  only seem to use  London images – red buses and Big Ben  – to promote the UK abroad.  Why not the Tyne Bridge and the Angel of the North?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We want to ensure it is looking its best as the symbol of our region’s proud engineering past and, we hope, prosperous future. We want to make it fit for a Queen, the Queen in fact, we very much hope the Queen will consider commemorating the Bridge her grandfather opened.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP John Penrose held a debate in Parliament yesterday to push Government Ministers about the importance of North Somerset&#8217;s bids for Levelling Up Fund and Community Renewal Fund cash to support the next steps in the town’s regeneration.<br><br>John was supported in the debate by Liam Fox (MP for North Somerset), and made the point that even though&nbsp;North Somerset District is ranked as a ‘priority 2’ area for the bid evaluations, the constituency of Weston-super-Mare would qualify as ‘priority 1’ if it was taken on its own, and needs regeneration at least as much as neighbouring ‘priority 1’ districts like Mendip and Sedgemoor.</p>



<p><br>John said: &#8220;Although other parts of North Somerset don’t need regeneration, there are parts of Weston that are in the most deprived 2-3% of the country. I called this debate to make the point that we ought to be at the front of the queue for levelling up and regeneration funding, and to&nbsp;push Ministers on how our bid should be given top priority as a result.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;The good news is that the Minister listened and confirmed that North Somerset Council&#8217;s bid will not be ignored because of North Somerset&#8217;s priority rating. I hope the debate has put our bid firmly onto his radar!&#8221;</p>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has today welcomed funding that has been awarded to two schools in Stockport and one in Tameside to ensure that the buildings remain in safe and good working order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Condition Improvement Fund (CIF) is a government fund that seeks to keep eligible academy, sixth-form college and voluntary aided school buildings safe and in good working order. This year, it will award funding to 1,466 projects across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2021-2022 funding round was heavily oversubscribed, so only schools deemed to have a ‘high project need’ were eventually awarded funding. Issues that the funding aims to tackle include poor building condition, building compliance, energy efficiency and health and safety. The announcement of the awarded funding was made by the Education Secretary yesterday after a rigorous assessment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Stockport, St Anne’s Roman Catholic High School and Reddish Vale High School were both awarded funding and in Tameside the funding went to Denton West End Primary School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site inspections and planning work are underway, and the Government plans to begin construction of the first projects in Autumn this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really pleased that St Anne’s Roman Catholic High School, Reddish Vale High School and Denton West End Primary School have been awarded this competitive funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely vital that our school buildings are in safe and working order, and I’m pleased that the needs of schools in Stockport and Tameside have been recognised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to working with the Government on securing further funding for our schools, colleges and academies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of joining campaigners outside of Parliament for the Travel Day of Action, fighting against the Government’s handling of covid travel restrictions.</p>



<p>I met with South Shields based travel agent, Graeme Brett, owner of Westoe Travel to discuss the ongoing challenges facing the travel industry. Graeme attended alongside a wide range of organisations from across the aviation and travel industries aiming to put pressure on the Government to support a safe return to international travel in time for the peak summer period.</p>



<p>The travel industry has been let down badly throughout the pandemic and the Government must provide sector-specific support and finance to all those affected. No other industry has been left in the dark like this and we’re going to see more and more travel agencies getting boarded up and people losing their jobs if we don’t act.</p>



<p>I believe the current traffic light system doesn’t work, it sends unclear messages to both business and travellers. With the promotion of clear and consistent public health messages and good measures in place, international travel could return.</p>



<p>Last week I voted against the extension of the covid roadmap restrictions. The virus will be with us for the long haul and repeated lockdowns and constant restrictions is not a long-term strategy. I believe we need to make a start reopening safe international travel and reap the benefits of our country’s vaccination programme.</p>



<p>For all who have lost their jobs and are fighting to re-open travel, I will continue to fight with you.</p>

    <title>Christina Rees MP calls on the UK Government to work with Labour to pass emergency legislation to protect British steel jobs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/christina-rees-mp-calls-on-the-uk-government-to-work-with-labour-to-pass-emergency-legislation-to-protect-british-steel-jobs/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, is calling on the UK Government to work with the Labour Party on a cross-party basis to pass emergency legislation giving Ministers the power to reject the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) recommendations; temporarily extend all 19 steel safeguards which would expire on the 30<sup>th</sup> June; and allow time to find a long term solution to protect the British Steel Industry.</p>
<p>Currently, when the TRA publishes a recommendation that certain safeguards be removed, the Secretary of State for International Trade has to either accept the recommendations and scrap nine of the current nineteen steel safeguards, or reject the recommendations which would keep the safeguards until they automatically expire at the end of the month.  But by taking Labour’s advice to pass emergency legislation, the UK Government could reject the recommendations and extend the current safeguards while a long-term solution is found.</p>
<p>TRA’s recommendations puts 33,700 well-paid, good-quality, skilled jobs at risk in the UK, in a sector where wages are up to 46% higher than average in regions where they are concentrated, such as South Wales.  Fewer safeguards could also lead to more imports of cheap steel from around the world, thus weakening the British steel industry.</p>
<p>Christina Rees MP took part in a debate in the House of Commons pressing for action to be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, said:</strong></p>
<p>“Steel is a vital industry in South Wales, both for the economy and the prosperity of our communities. If the TRA’s recommendations were to be accepted, it risks a potential disaster for the British Steel industry and threatens jobs in Neath.</p>
<p>“This comes at the worst possible time when the British steel industry is already reeling from the impact of the Covid pandemic, disruption caused by Brexit, a loss of key investors, and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the interconnectedness of the steel industry.</p>
<p>“If the UK Government is serious about levelling-up our country and defending national interest, they must work with Labour to pass the necessary emergency legislation.  Labour is prepared to pull out all the stops to protect these vital safeguards and keep pushing for a British steel industry that is ready and confident for the future.”</p>

    <title>Scalpay back online after community call in MP for help</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2021/06/23/scalpay-back-online-after-community-call-in-mp-for-help/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Residents on Scalpay are back online after nearly two months of service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scalpay Community Council contacted Angus MacNeil MP to alert him to the disruption faced by around 20 households who were affected by an ongoing broadband problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disruption to service was causing problems for those working from home due to Covid-19 restrictions and for local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kenny Macleod, Secretary of Scalpay Community Council, and one of those affected, said: “After weeks of being given different stories and being told it was fixed, we got in touch with our MP, Mr MacNeil, and are very grateful for his intervention which has undoubtedly speeded up the resolution of our problems.&amp;nbsp; If he hadn’t intervened and got the engineers onto the ferry, we would probably still be waiting for it to be fixed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are all hugely dependant on a good, reliable internet connection and not having it for so long caused lots of problems. Hopefully now these are resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil had contacted Openreach to try to push forward a solution and was very pleased when it was confirmed to him that a team was set to travel to the island imminently to work on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openreach then contacted Mr MacNeil for assistance due to the difficulties they were facing in securing a ferry booking to the island and Mr MacNeil then contacted Calmac to stress the urgency of the situation and a ferry booking was made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team carried out works and although not all issues have been overcome, households have now been reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The engineers replaced the dishes on the 18Ghz radio link at both ends, but they are still waiting on parts for the 32g link which need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional works are due to be carried out to increase speeds when parts arrive, however Openreach state there are no live faults in this area and services are now operating as normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Openreach are also looking at providing additional weatherproofing to try and stop the problems occurring again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased that I was able to assist the community on Scalpay in moving towards a resolution to this problem which was causing disruption to everyday life and was understandably frustrating for residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I cannot fix all problems which constituents raise with me, but I would encourage people to get in touch and I will do all I can to assist.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, is chairing a further virtual meeting this Friday with local farmers and representatives from the Environment Agency (EA), East Riding Council (ERYC) and the National Farmers Union to follow up on the discussion they had in April. Sir Greg Knight has been invited as the Chairman of Hull River Board and as a neighbouring MP, whose farmers are similarly affected.</p>
<p>This will be an opportunity for Graham (and Sir Greg) to keep in touch with farmers and for the EA to report back about the progress they have made since the first meeting. Farmers will also get the chance to raise any additional concerns they may have.</p>
<p>In the interim, there has been continuing discussion with the EA and ERYC about the outcome of the Bathymetric Survey of River Hull bed and what can be done to improve the situation for farmers who have been adversely affected.  </p>
<p>Graham said, “I look forward to chairing the follow up meeting and to hearing an update from the EA about the work they have been doing. It is fantastic that Sir Greg Knight is on board and will be joining us for this meeting with some of the farmers in his constituency too. I do hope that a clear proposal for the way forward can be agreed and that agencies can work together in order to achieve it and reduce the effect that flooding has on local farmers in the coming winters.”</p>

    <title>LETTER: UK Minister urged to publish delayed review</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/uk-minister-urged-to-publish-delayed-review-of-how-the-welfare-system-treats-terminally-ill-people/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=uk-minister-urged-to-publish-delayed-review-of-how-the-welfare-system-treats-terminally-ill-people" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The chairs of two cross-party groups in the UK Parliament have written to Justin Tomlinson MP, the Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work to publish its review of how the welfare system treats terminally ill people.</p>
<p>The letter from the Chair of the APPG for Terminal Illness and the Chair of the APPG for Motor Neurone Disease can be found here <a href="http://www.drewhendrymp.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/APPG-Letter-DWP-220621.pdf">APPG-Letter-DWP-220621</a></p>
<p>The announcement of a review by the UK Government was made in July 2019 following a <a href="https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/globalassets/media/documents/policy/policy-publications/2019/d393_when-time-really-matters-24-pages_web.pdf">report</a> by Terminal Illness APPG that found that the current legal definition of terminal illness is arbitrary, outdated and not based on clinical reality. Terminally ill people who have an uncertain prognosis and may survive longer than six months are unable to access fast-track support from the benefits system.</p>
<p>Commenting, the Chair of the APPG for Terminal Illness, Drew Hendry said:</p>
<p>“The disgraceful and punitive ‘6 months or less’ policy is actively preventing terminally ill people from accessing benefits and must be scrapped.</p>
<p>“We have been urging the UK government to take action on this issue facing terminally ill people for years.</p>
<p>“The APPG on Terminal Illness’s inquiry report in 2019 revealed that the ‘six-month rule’ leaves terminally ill people facing devastating and far-reaching financial hardship and crippling debt because of a policy brought in three decades ago that has no relevance now.</p>
<p>“UK ministers promised a review of the policy following the report – instead of action, we have been met with a deafening silence. Clinicians, social and palliative care workers and medical experts all recommend reform of this rule.</p>
<p>“Marie Curie and the Motor Neurone Disease Association estimate that more than 6,000 people have died waiting for a decision on their benefits claim since the DWP announced its review IN 2019.</p>
<p>“The six-month rule continues to fail terminally ill people and their families for years – a simple policy fix would stop that.</p>
<p>“The Scottish Government legislated in 2018 to scrap the six-month rule for devolved benefits. However, the rule remains in place for reserved benefits such as Universal Credit. The UK Government must follow the Scottish Government’s lead and scrap the punitive ‘6 months to live’ policy so no one living with a terminal illness in the UK has to prove they have 6 months to live to access fast-tracked welfare support.”</p>

<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s great to be back on constituency days again. Being out and about in the constituency.</p>
<p>“Meeting people, visiting schools is vital work for any constituency MP and frankly the kind of thing which has been really difficult to do during COVID. It’s just not the same when you’re on a Zoom video- fantastic to be back out in person.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr Shapps’ first visited recently painted murals in subways by the station in Hatfield.</p>
<p>Two pedestrian subways in Hatfield have been transformed into works of art, to provide safe and attractive walking and cycling routes between Hatfield Station and Hatfield House.</p>
<p>Badgers, butterflies, balloons, and bicycles are just some of the colourful new images to be seen in the transformed subways, along with murals celebrating Hatfield’s role in the development of the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>The improvements to the subways have been undertaken by Hertfordshire County Council in partnership with Network Rail and supported by Hatfield House and the local community. The redecoration is part of a programme of works to brighten and improve pedestrian subways across Hertfordshire to make walking and cycling more attractive options for residents.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>At the site, Mr Shapps- who is also Transport Secretary- said: “To bring together so many organisations and agencies to all work on the same project is really impressive. It’s also lovely to note that lots of school children were involved in creating these murals.</p>
<p>It supports something I’ve been saying for a long time- if you want people to active travel, their surroundings need to be pleasant, and well looked after. I’ve cycled through these subways quite a lot and I’ve got to say they’re looking so much better. My congratulations to all involved.”</p>
<p>Phil Bibby, Herts County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport, said: “Improving these subways in Hatfield is part of a wider programme to encourage active travel and reduce car use across the county.</p>
<p>Walking and cycling have so many direct benefits to both physical and mental health, and if everyone made a few more journeys on foot or bike, and a few less in the car, that would have a big impact on air quality, and therefore on everyone’s health. That’s why improving routes like these is so important to us.”</p>
<p>Next stop for Mr Shapps was Stanborough School in Welwyn Garden City, where he met with Headteacher Merry John to tour the school, check on its progress, and open a newly completed Music &amp; Drama block.</p>
<p>The opening, at which teachers, governors and students attended, Mrs John said: “This new block is a fantastic base for our young musicians and performers- they deserve the best. I’m really pleased to see that during lunchtime, during lessons, it’s a thriving place for our students. Thank you so much to Grant for being able to join us for the official opening.”</p></div>

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-35/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with another update about the Coronavirus pandemic and some other local issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, as you will probably be aware, the Prime Minister has taken a decision to extend the remaining restrictions until the end of the 18th July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summary of the current rules is &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEDDINGS AND CIVIL PARTNERSHIP CEREMONIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two exceptions to this. The first is that the limit of 30 people allowed to attend a wedding has been removed, though a number of conditions remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details of this are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-wedding-and-civil-partnership-ceremonies-receptions-and-celebrations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARE HOME RESIDENTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition care home residents are now allowed to spend a night away from their homes without having to isolate on their return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details are here:&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/care-home-residents-can-stay-overnight-as-visiting-restrictions-ease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SURREY COVID CASES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent increase in cases in Surrey has mostly affected younger people who are yet to be vaccinated and those who have only had a single jab. This does underline how important it is that people who are still unvaccinated or who have yet to book in for their second jab and are eligible to do so book an appointment now. You can do so via the NHS website at;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest figures for Surrey are &lt;a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/263691/Surrey_covid-19_infographic_1106.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHALK PIT EPSOM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know many people remain extremely concerned about the noise and dust nuisance coming from the Chalk Pit in College Road, Epsom at the moment. I have been working with local residents on the issue and pushing the Environment Agency to act. I have had several meetings with the Agency and they have been working through a formal process which I hope will reach a resolution in the next few days. Please keep updating me if you experience serious noise or dust from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CITIZENS ADVICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epsom and Ewell Citizens Advice team have asked me to remind people that if they are having difficulties as a result of the pandemic or some other issue, they are often able to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their latest details and contacts &lt;a href="http://www.caee.org.uk/get-advice/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much hope that we can move on from the pandemic very soon and everyone will be able to enjoy the rest of the summer. As always, if you have questions or issues please feel free to email me, though please use my Parliamentary address as this message comes from a no reply service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Grayling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RT Hon Chris Grayling MP&lt;br /&gt;
Member of Parliament for Epsom and Ewell&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Great to be at Dafen Primary School yesterday to see them become the world’s first Global Entrecompedu Pioneer School.</p>



<p>Pupils, staff and many others involved with the school have worked really hard to embrace the scheme which gives children of all year groups the skills and knowledge needed to understand the world of business and commerce.</p>



<p>Particularly inspiring to hear directly from the children about how they put protecting the environment and collaborating with others at the centre of their work.</p>



<p>Congratulations to everyone involved and good luck with helping to share your experiences with other schools in the local area and across the UK and Europe!</p>

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
