&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, joined stars of stage and screen outside Parliament last week in a campaign to ban imports of hunting trophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Lumley and Downton Abbey star Peter Egan were among those to express their support for Gwynne and the ‘Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British trophy hunters shoot hundreds of endangered animals each year, including lions, elephants, giraffes and polar bears. The law currently allows British trophy hunters to bring their ‘trophies’ – including animals’ heads and bodies – back into the country to display in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls show that almost 9 in 10 voters support a full ban on the practise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am really proud to be supporting this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trophy hunting is a cruel and barbaric practise and has absolutely no place in 21st century Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innocent animals are being killed, while the Government continues to dither and delay. We need a total ban and we need it now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joanna Lumley said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andrew Gwynne is representing the 9 in 10 voters who want to see an end to this barbaric, cruel industry. It should have been abolished long ago. What sort of world do we live in where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;endangered animals can be killed for thrills by British trophy hunters? It is the height of cowardice. Andrew has my full support for this campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Egan added: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I applaud Andrew’s courageous campaign. The American gun lobby is fighting efforts to ban this evil ‘sport’ because it says hunters’ ‘rights’ should be protected. But what about the innocent, defenceless animals that are killed by British trophy hunters every year just for kicks? Andrew is absolutely right to stand up to the industry lobbyists and to speak up for voiceless animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Public services that can be improved.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2022/03/22/public-services-that-can-be-improved/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>This is my latest Conservative Home article:</div>
<div/>
<div>When I go shopping I do not set out to maximise what I spend. If I tell friends and family I do not report that I have bought £70 of goods only to face a barrage of complaints that I had not spent £80 instead. I go to the shops with a list of things I need. I compare prices and qualities . I might tell them what I have bought. I might only mention what I paid if I had found some bargains or been given a good offer.</div>
<div>Nor when I go to the shops do I need to ask how much the shop has spent on providing its service, in order to go to the one that has spent the most. I go to the shops that combine a good environment, friendly and prompt service and value for money goods. I would not regard it as a defence for poor service or shoddy products if the shop told me they had nonetheless spent a lot on delivering this. Nor would I take pity if they told me the experience was rubbish because their owner had left them short of cash to spend on staff and stock.</div>
<div>So why then when daily I listen to the government and Opposition hammering at each other over important public services, do they spend most of their time talking about costs? The NHS must be great says the government, because we have just spent £20bn more on it. That is not enough thunders the Opposition. It would be perfect if we just spent a bit more. Ministers rarely give us any detail over where all the extra money is going, and the Opposition rarely tell us what extra items or staff they would want to hire. It is unusual to hear a normal debate about the quality and range of service, its availability, and how these could in detail be improved. Money is national and political. Service provision is local and outside politics. The detail of why a service is poor is apparently too difficult or too embarrassing for politicians to discuss.</div>
<div>The government should change this pointless debate. They should tell us what improvements to service and what increase in service they are going to buy, and tell us how they will seek to achieve better value for money. They may need to incentivise public sector staff to align their interests with the consumer interest. Ministers may need to change the odd Chief Executive of whom the public sector has so many to ensure better performance. Senior managers should report openly their successes and failures and encourage grown up understanding of what needs doing to improve. As we approach a debate on strengthening our nation’s defences we should not debate how much money we should spend. We should debate what extra capabilities we need and then set about providing them to the right quality for an affordable price.</div>
<div>The danger is monopoly provision gives too much power to the professional providers and not enough to the consumers. We have a monopoly nationalised road network. The users pay many times its cost through special taxes on owning and using a road vehicle . Highways England and many Council Highways departments seem to delight in closing roads or parts of roads as often as possible. They allow utility companies access to dig them up and put in cables and pipes in ways guaranteed to create many future needs to close the highway and dig it up again. Why not place these networks in reinforced conduits for ease of access and why not put more of them away from the centre of a main road? They often keep parts of the roads closed at evenings and week-ends when no-one is working on the closed portions. There is no sense that the user taxpayers have any right to expect the road to be more freely available more often. Many Councils regularly change the signs, paintings, lanes, junctions and crossings in ways which make the life of the car commuter or business van driver ever more difficult</div>
<div>Last week I went to speak in far away city by train. The fairly new rains were a lot less comfortable than the old ones they replaced. There was no hot meal service even though I was travelling at meal times. The computer system telling you where your seat was did not work. Overall it was a bad and expensive service. Train services are now hugely subsidised so they should think more about how to make themselves more attractive to the users. The collapse of office working post covid is in part a large revolt of the commuter against train services they regard as both bad in quality and too dear. Too many commuters have been let down by cancelled and delayed trains, by a shortage of seats and by season tickets going through the roof. The wrong kind of snow, leaves on the line and the late running of the train ahead pall as reasons for delayed arrivals.</div>
<div>Public services like health and education that are free at the point of use have plenty of demand which they struggle to meet. Public services like trains and buses with user charges struggle to fill their seats. The public sector is reluctant to close services and facilities that lack users and finds it difficult to keep up with demand where free offers help make a service very popular. Recent years have brought a passion to take the management of many of these services out of politics by delegating the use and control of resources and the recruitment and training of staff to expert managers. Labour and Conservative Ministers favoured this, thinking it meant they would not be to blame when things went wrong. Instead the Minister is still blamed for every failing, whilst the management usually escapes criticism and may even keep their well paid jobs despite some disaster. Parliament concentrates on playing party politics, where the Opposition blames every management failing on too little money, and the government claims they had enough all along. No wonder the services often cost a lot and do not deliver the quality and range we want. We want an NHS free at the point of use and free places for all needing them in schools. We need better ways to debate successes and failures, with more attention on how the money is spent. Ministers who provide the cash need more control over how it is spent all the time they are held responsible.</div>

<p><span><span><span>I was delighted to meet new headteacher Kirstin Sutherland at North Elmham, who had a School Parliament Q and A session set up for me with some great questions on what an MP does in Parliament and Mid Norfolk. I was also able to see their outdoor learning area and see the children making ponds and huts, as well as developing valuable life skills.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Two lovely, proud, young students showed me around their school at Brisley – showing me the likes of the veg patch and the mud kitchen. I even had a quick run on their outdoor tyre course!</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If YOU are a school in Mid Norfolk that would be interested in having me visit, do get in touch via <a href="mailto:george.freeman.mp@parliament.uk">george.freeman.mp@parliament.uk</a> . I’d be delighted to come and speak with you all.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <title>Isles MP presses for rethink on Uig Harbour plans to minimise disruption</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/03/21/isles-mp-presses-for-rethink-on-uig-harbour-plans-to-minimise-disruption/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP Angus MacNeil has contacted Donna Manson, Chief Executive of Highland Council and Transport Minister, Jenny Gilruth, following Highland Council’s announcement that Uig Harbour will be closed from 10 October 2022 &amp;#8211; 27 March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Mr MacNeil stated: “There is a great deal of concern in my constituency about the lengthy closure of Uig Harbour and the impact this will have on our islands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I understand that Comhairle nan Eilean Siar requested that any closure should not start until after the October School Holidays, which is traditionally a time when many families travel and is also when the Royal National Mod takes place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I also understand that the initial closure period was 6 weeks and that an explanation has not been given as to why this has changed to 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have asked Highland Council and the Transport Minister if a solution could be found to minimise the disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Service continuity plans are currently being finalised by Calmac in response to Highland Council’s announcement and these will be presented to the community in a second round of consultations in Uist, Skye and Harris at the following dates/times and locations:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Speaking at a parliamentary reception organised by the national housing and homelessness charity Shelter, Tim said that families across the South Lakes were being served with Section 21 evictions so that their landlord could put their home on Airbnb.</p>
<p>Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act allows landlords to evict tenants without having to provide a reason and with as little as two months' notice.</p>
<p>Speaking after the event, Tim said: <em>"Cumbria's housing crisis is leading to young people not being able to afford to stay in the town or village that they grew up in.</em></p>
<p><em>"Meanwhile many are being evicted from their home so their landlord can make a quick buck by putting it on the holiday market.</em></p>
<p><em>"Not only is this immoral, it is also massively bad news for our local economy which is being robbed of the local workforce that businesses are crying out for.</em></p>
<p><em>"It's been 27 months since the Conservatives put in their manifesto at the general election that they would scrap section 21 evictions but they've done nothing."</em></p>

<p>The Birmingham MP has been calling for action on the sector for several years. In November 2020 he secured a Westminster debate on HMO conversions from family homes to unregulated supported housing. In that debate Steve McCabe described some of the problems unregulated properties were causing his constituents, including threats, abuse and high levels of anti social behaviour.</p>



<p>Steve then introduced a 10 Minute Rule Bill on Supported Accommodation&nbsp;to&nbsp;address some of the problems of&nbsp;HMO’s being used as supported accommodation without sufficient regulation and oversight of the support offered, the conditions of the property and suitability of the&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;or housing provider. The Bill had cross-party support and petitioned the Government to take urgent action to safeguard residents and crack down on rogue landlords.&nbsp;MP&#8217;s across Birmingham have been continuously petitioning the Government on behalf of their residents and recently launched a petition in conjunction with the Birmingham Mail.</p>



<p>In Birmingham, the Local Authority was given £1.048 million funding for a 6-month pilot to test local interventions to regulate supported accommodation. Due to the success of the pilots in Birmingham and other areas of the country, the Government has decided to extend the proposals nationally as part of the Supported Housing Improvement Programme. The Government have also finally decided to provide extra funding and greater scrutiny to ensure higher standards of care in the sector. </p>



<p>Commenting on the announcement, Steve McCabe said:</p>



<p>&#8220;After years of campaigning and raising serious concerns about this sector, I am pleased the Government has listened to our calls for greater regulation. For too long, vulnerable people in Selly Oak and across Birmingham have been left with poor levels of support while some landlords rake in huge amounts of cash and provide substandard care. This is the issue I sought to resolve in my 10 Minute Rule Bill back in 2020.</p>



<p><br>It&#8217;s great to see some success, through the pilot interventions, for Birmingham City Council on this matter. I hope the government&#8217;s proposals can be expanded on and implemented quickly. I am happy to work with ministers. Birmingham city council and my colleagues in Parliament to secure much needed improvements in this sector&#8221;</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/03/18/weekly-round-up-21/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-21" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I started this week with a meeting of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee where we discussed the regulation of standards in public life for our inquiry into the propriety of governance in light of Greensill. We heard from two former Independent Advisers on Ministerial Interests, Sir Philip Mawer and Sir Alex Allen. When the post was created, an independent panel suggested that in order to increase the independence of the role they should be fixed, non-renewable terms and recruited through open competition. Neither of these recommendations were adopted and therefore the appointment process is entirely at the Prime Minister’s discretion. The Independent Adviser is also relatively weak in comparison to other standards overseers. It is clear that this system needs reform – the Prime Minister cannot have discretionary powers over such a fundamental role which ensures the system can be trusted from the outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I joined a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Healthcare Infrastructure this week, of which I am a vice-chair. This meeting was to discuss a refresh of the health infrastructure strategy. Healthcare infrastructure has to consider more than just the physical aspects of hospitals and equipment; it has to consider whether the infrastructure is reaching the areas it needs to and has the right equipment to support the NHS to reduce waiting lists and provide the care that is needed. After a decade of Tory austerity and mismanagement, the NHS went into the pandemic with record high waiting lists and 100,000 fewer staff than needed. The Tories have dismantled the health service and now are demanding huge tax rises from working people to restore it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I was pleased to meet with Christian Shanahan from We are Local. In 2020 they built the UK’s first local community e-commerce platform – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wearebs3.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We are BS3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. The platform is a great way to find local businesses from restaurants to exercise classes, from gifts to technology. Shopping locally is beneficial for so many reasons – we are able to support our local community and economy to grow as well as helping reduce the miles that our products travel. We are Local have worked to replicate this platform in communities across the UK and it was interesting to hear from Christian about the ambitions they have to drive this initiative forward. It’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;always good to meet with constituents involved in innovating solutions to support local businesses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On St. Patrick’s Day on Thursday it was a pleasure to speak in the Irish Diaspora in Britain debate in Parliament. I spoke about my own parents&amp;#8217; move from rural Ireland to London in the 1970s, and the support shown by the Irish community in Britain for individuals and groups around the country on matters of culture, heritage and health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I was shocked to hear the announcement from P&amp;amp;O Ferries this week that they had sacked 800 British crew across its entire fleet with plans to use lower-paid agency staff to operate its ships. The actions of P&amp;amp;O Ferries is a national scandal and a betrayal of workers. At a time when we are already experiencing a cost of living crisis, many workers will now be left wondering how they are going to make ends meet. The Government must take action against this disgraceful act. I asked the Minister whether he’d had any discussions with the Irish Government or with members in the Northern Ireland Assembly about the impact this will have on Northern Ireland and Irish trade. Whilst the Minister has not yet had such discussions, I hope he will consider doing so in order to protect this important trade route. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I am looking forward to speaking on a panel on “Transforming Women’s Health and Social Care” at Labour Women’s Conference tomorrow. There has been so much change in the last decade or so around women’s health – we are beginning to have the discussions that are so needed for women and girls to understand their health. My Labour colleague Carolyn Harris has been campaigning for more support for women around the menopause that involves pushing for better training for medical staff in identifying the symptoms of the menopause and for improving women’s access to HRT. In Northern Ireland we are still working towards ensuring women have access to the abortion services they are legally entitled to. We also have to remember that women’s health needs to be taught to young girls too. Young girls should not be learning about their periods through experiencing them, without the preparation that helps them understand what they will experience and why. Of course, women’s health needs to be understood by men as well – they need to know how to support their partners, daughters, and mothers. It is good to see these conversations growing, but we need to keep pushing them onto the agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>The Government’s announcement on 17<sup>th</sup> March 2022 that the DWP’s office at Phoenix House, Oldham will close and 168 staff will be ‘consolidated’ to Salford and Stockport offices by January 2023 expose the Tories’ rhetoric on levelling-up to be utterly hollow.</p>
<p>The Minister’s <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-17/debates/FE43622F-D977-4854-B63A-246B563C9710/DWPEstateOfficeClosures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admission</a> that 1,300 DWP staff work at sites where there is no other site nearby and his failure to rule out compulsory redundancies is deeply concerning. Ministers are removing quality public sector jobs from communities who need them in the middle of a devastating cost of living crisis with the price of petrol, food and energy soaring.</p>
<p>The DWP must fully engage with the Departmental Trade Unions and staff on this closure, many of whom are worried about their futures, especially if they’re unable to move within their role to Stockport or Salford.  The Government should also assess the economic impact of losing these jobs on our town centre with a plan to help communities like Oldham attract well-paid jobs back to our area.</p>

    <title>Preet Kaur Gill MP and Simon Foster secure dedicated Policing across Quinton and Bartley Green </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-kaur-gill-mp-and-simon-foster-secure-dedicated-policing-across-quinton-and-bartley" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, and West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster, are proud to announce that Quinton and Bartley Green will receive dedicated Police sergeants in a first step to tackling rising crime rates.  </p>
<p>Over the past ten years residents across Edgbaston Constituency (including Quinton, Bartley Green, Harborne, Edgbaston and North Edgbaston) have felt the direct impact of cuts to local Police forces with crime increasing across key indicators. Burglary has increased by 11%, knife crime by 29% and vehicle crime by 16% all in the last 12 months.  </p>
<p>The Conservative Government has cut 20,000 officers nationally and this has filtered down to the West Midlands where £175 million has been cut from Policing budgets and over 2,000 officers have been taken off the streets. Locally, this has meant Quinton and Bartley Green have been forced to share a Policing team. </p>
<p>However, thanks to the collective and ongoing efforts of Preet Kaur Gill, Simon Foster and the support of local Labour Party candidates for Quinton Lauren Rainbow and Sam Forsyth, Quinton will see a new and dedicated Police Sergeant, Bushra Zarif, who will join the ward with Bartley Green retaining Sergeant Mark Short.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “After campaigning for this change to our Police team for a number of years, I’m delighted to welcome Sergeant Zarif to Quinton and to retain Sergeant Short in Bartley Green.  </p>
<p>“Crime has drastically increased over the last decade, but it is our Police officers on the ground that are vital in tackling this. I’ve spent time challenging the number of officers we have available across the constituency, both at a national and regional level to ensure we begin to address this deficit. This has involved many conversations with operational Police teams and our Police and Crime Commissioner. It’s fantastic to see this positive end result.” </p>
<p>Simon Foster, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner said, “I’ve pledged 450 additional neighbourhood police officers to rebuild community policing. We are making progress and so far, we have delivered nearly half of that pledge. The West Midlands needs preventative, proactive, problem solving and visible policing out on the streets keeping people, their families and communities safe.  </p>
<p>“Violent crime has flourished thanks to a decade of reckless government cuts. My plan will help prevent and tackle violent crime. My 450 neighbourhood officers will make a real difference. However, despite the increase in officer numbers, by 2023 we will still be 1,000 officers short of the offices we had in 2010. That is why I have launched a campaign that seeks cross-party support, to require the government to return our 1,000 missing officers and to provide fair funding for the West Midlands.” </p>
<p>Lauren Rainbow and Sam Forsyth are both Labour’s candidates for Quinton in the upcoming local elections in May following the retirement of Cllr Kate Booth. They said, “We fully support these positive changes that are being brought to Quinton by the collective efforts of our local MP and the Police and Crime Commissioner. It is exciting to see what can be achieved when the Police are backed by a strong Labour team that supports our local Police teams. If elected in May, we will work closely with both Preet and Simon to support plans to return our community to the proper neighbourhood policing it deserves.” </p>

    <title>Judith presents her bill to tackle the menace of nuisance quads</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-presents-her-bill-to-tackle-the-menace-of-nuisance-quads/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday in Parliament, Judith brought forward a bill to tackle nuisance quads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the Bill, Judith said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anti-social quads are a growing problem in our towns and cities. They create a massive noise nuisance, and their reckless, dangerous and illegal use is a threat to other road users and pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over a thousand quads are stolen from farms every year, and many of those make their way onto our streets. Off-road quads are not road legal precisely because they are not safe for use on our public highways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The police work hard to deal with problem quads, but once seized, there’s no guarantee that they won’t end up back on the roads plaguing the very same neighbourhoods time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a cycle that must be broken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The seize and release approach is not working, police must be given the power to seize and destroy nuisance quads, taking them off the street permanently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My bill will propose giving police the powers they need to dispose of these quads once seized so they can never be used illegally on our streets again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am also calling for consistency in the law for wearing helmets – we must make helmets a legal requirement for quad users on public roads, just as they are for motorbikes and mopeds. The evidence is clear that helmets help prevent serious injury. Legislation needs to catch up with the reality of the growing number of quads on our roads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want immobilisers to be mandatory on quads. This adds another layer of protection for legitimate owners like farmers and deters thefts, reducing the number of stolen vehicles getting onto the roads in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to stop seeing these vehicles as toys. They can cost as much as a car and are powerful for their small size. If we continue to let this type of vehicle slip through the cracks in current legislation, we fail to protect legitimate owners from needless theft, we fail to protect residents dealing with chronic noise, and we fail to protect all road users and pedestrians who remain at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Police need the power to seize and destroy problem quads and wearing helmets on these vehicles should be the law. Today I brought my bill to Parliament to bring in measures to tackle nuisance and anti-social quads.

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-74/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My week began with the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-07/debates/97B249F2-C666-46EF-B46A-F2FF22DE2264/EconomicCrime(TransparencyAndEnforcement)Bill">Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill</a> and after a very long debate on the many amendments that had been tabled, only three amendments were pushed to a division. New Clause 2 was a cross-party amendment and was voted on at 9.39pm. It would require the Secretary of State to publish and lay before Parliament a report on the funding of enforcement agencies in connection with the reforms to “unexplained wealth orders”, as provided for in part 2 of the Bill. We lost 229-303. New Clause 7 was a Labour Front Bench amendment and was voted on at 9.54pm. It would require the Secretary of State to lay draft legislation on further Companies House reform (taken from the White Paper published on Monday) within 28 days of this proposal receiving Royal Assent. We lost 225-306. New Clause 29 was another cross-party amendment and was voted on at 10.08pm. It would empower the Secretary of State to publish the name of a person being considered as a “person for sanctions”, which immediately imposes on that person a duty not to sell any assets they own or in which they have an interest, or to move any of their assets or funds out of the UK, on pain of criminal liability (and risk of imprisonment). We lost 234-300.</p>
<p>Tuesday began with a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Restorative Justice (RJ) of which I’ve been vice-chair since its inception in April 2021. We discussed progress on the work streams that were set up directly from the recommendations contained in our inquiry report “<a href="https://restorativejustice.org.uk/blog/restorative-justice-appg-inquiry-report-published">Restorative Practices in 2021/22</a>” which sought to assess where the sector is and what steps could be taken to improve and co-ordinate the various services and improve outcomes for victims and offenders. The inquiry brought together over 50 leading practitioners and exponents of RJ, and there were over 200,000 submitted words of evidence. The APPG are hopeful that the UK Government will recognise the enormous benefits of RJ and roll out our recommendations in full across the UK. The 9 recommendations are: registration of commissioned services; standardise information sharing; improve quality through monitoring and evaluation; publication of a new action plan; reviewing ring-fenced RJ funding; explore automatic rights for victims through Victims Law; PCCs should end RJ funding blanket bans; more and better communications; and creating a specific RJ UK Government Minister. At our APPG meeting the chair Elliot Colburn MP stated that the report had been well received, but he was very disappointed that Victim’s Law did not mention RJ once.</p>
<p>As a member of the Petitions Committee, I attended a future work program meeting and I’m honoured to have been nominated to present the “<a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/554073">Ban greyhound racing to end the unnecessary deaths and suffering of racing dogs</a>” petition on behalf of the Petitions Committee in Westminster Hall on Monday 28th March. The petition has attracted 104,885 signatures.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-08/debates/d57f8a4a-304a-4bc1-9f56-c17cdc4ab6e6/DraftHumanMedicines(CoronavirusAndInfluenza)(Amendment)Regulations2022DraftHumanMedicines(AmendmentsRelatingToTheEarlyAccessToMedicinesScheme)Regulati"> Third Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which discussed 2 Statutory Instruments which were to be taken together because they have a similar purpose. The first SI concerns regulations made in 2020 which made temporary provisions for the manufacture and use of coronavirus and influenza vaccinations, to ensure that vaccines could be distributed and administered at pace. These regulations included a sunset clause which meant that the provisions ceased on 1st April 2022. This SI extends the sunset clause for some provisions to 1st April 2024, and makes others permanent. The second SI provided a statutory basis for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) which gives patients with life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to treatments that are either not authorised or not authorised for that particular clinical use. The members of the committee agreed that the 2 SIs be debated together. The UK Government Minister Ed Argar, moved and explained the SIs. The Labour Shadow Minister Andrew Gwynne and the SNP Spokesperson asked questions of the Minister, but did not oppose the SIs, which were approved without a division.</p>
<p>The Speaker granted the unprecedented request from the President of another country to make a direct, live, <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28902686-865d-48ea-ba23-90aa2aebd061?agenda=True">address to Parliamentarians</a> in the Chamber of the House of Commons. At 4.45pm the Speaker suspended the sitting so that MPs could take their seats, and Peers sat in the Private Gallery, to listen to the address from the President of Ukraine, who spoke to us in Ukrainian, but we all had headsets which carried contemporary translation. The President has shown immense courage and leadership in the face of the untrammelled aggression from Putin. Words are not enough to express the suffering of Ukraine people at the hands of a despot. We gave the President a standing ovation at the beginning and at the end of his speech. It was one of the most emotional moments of my life as an MP.</p>
<p>As chair of the APPG for Sport I met virtually with our secretariat Max and Leigh from the Sport and Recreation Alliance to plan our forthcoming APPG meetings for 2022. There are so many issues in the sport sector that need discussing. Some examples are: feedback on the Olympics and Paralympics; Sport in Devolved Nations – massive congratulations to my friend Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson who was appointed chair of Sport Wales this week – Tanni is vice-chair of our APPG; and the UK Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-russias-war-on-ukraine-international-sport">statement</a> released by Rt Hon Secretary of State DCMS Nadine Dorries MP about Russia’s War on Ukraine and International Sport.</p>
<p>I bobbed throughout the duration of PMQs, but unfortunately the Speaker did not call me. This is the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1501588121993031680?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">question would have asked</a> on behalf of my constituents: “On 1st March, two of my constituents went to Ukraine to rescue three family members. They applied for a Ukraine Family Scheme Visa and were given appointments at VAC Rzeszow, but Tatiana aged 65 was given 18th March, Olya aged 38 was given 21st March, and young Danil aged 9 was given 22nd March. They are now homeless. I’ve urged UK Visa and Immigration to act quickly and give the family appointments on the same day, but no answer. What would you tell my constituents Prime Minister?”.</p>
<p>As a Labour and Co-operative MP I reported back regarding the Wales Co-operative Council AGM to our monthly meeting of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. It is important that the work of the Group and the Council are mutually recognised for all the work that they do together to promote the values of the Co-operative Party.</p>

    <title>Violence Against Women and Girls</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.danjarvis.org/violence_against_women_and_girls" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Readers of last week’s edition of the <em>Barnsley Chronicle </em>will have seen the story of Darfield Councillor Pauline Markham, the victim of a despicable and cowardly attack in a local park, simply for serving the public to the best of her ability. In her own words she summed up the injustice, “I was simply a woman who was walking her dog.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly, Pauline’s story is part of a much wider issue – our collective failure to take violence against women and girls seriously. We’ve seen it locally in the rising instances of girls’ drinks being spiked on nights out, soaring cases of stalking in the last year; and the devastating statistic that 86% of women aged 18-24 in the UK have been sexually harassed.</p></div>

    <title>Local Update Ukraine</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am writing to you with information about local help for those affected by the situation in Ukraine as well as how you can contribute to the national fund being collected to support people affected by the War.</p>
<p>A local team has set up a collection centre for local donations in the old H&amp;M unit in the Ashley Centre. That’s the original unit near House of Fraser and not the double floored one which has closed recently. They are in the process of setting up a formal charity to do so, and have an organised plan to move donations out to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their biggest ask right now is for donations of medical supplies, and in particular things like bandages, as well as over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen. If you have items that you do not need, or are willing to buy some and drop them off there, I know that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>They are also asking for donations to help pay for fuel costs to get van loads of supplies to the Polish/Ukrainian border, and are able to take cash or card donations at the centre in Epsom.</p>
<p>If you want to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee/Red Cross national appeal the link to the appeal site is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dec.org.uk">www.dec.org.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>Your donation is being match funded by the Government.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me about providing accommodation locally for Ukrainian refugees. I am in discussions about this at the moment and will provide a further update later in the week.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local MP wins refunds for residents of burned-out flats</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.shapps.com/local-mp-wins-refunds-for-residents-of-burned-out-flats/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=local-mp-wins-refunds-for-residents-of-burned-out-flats" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has won refunds for residents of Ashley Court, Hatfield, who were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire, and then subject to unfair service charges for housing they were unable to reside in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has been over a year since the residents of Ashley Court were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During this time residents, many of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site &amp;#8211; residing in temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building work aimed at restoring Ashley Court has also been delayed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, residents of Ashley Court were billed £225 per month in service charges for housing they had not occupied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This monthly fee included charges for various services, including a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, which residents were not benefitting from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 2021, local MP Grant Shapps wrote to Sanctuary Housing, the housing association responsible for managing Ashley Court, expressing his concern about “the impact on his constituents” nominally resident there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary Housing responded to Mr Shapps’ letter but at that time did not agree to waive the £225 a month charge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In February, Mr Shapps wrote to the association once again (below), this time saying that he was putting it “on notice” over its unfair treatment of residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40879" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40880" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following this most recent letter, Sanctuary Housing responded quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a major victory for the residents, the association apologised, saying that it had got its “approach wrong” regarding Ashley Court, and that it would be refunding service charge payments to residents as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The association also said it would refund payments for deceased residents to their respective estates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary Housing stated it would be conducting a “more detailed review” of how the residents of Ashley Court were put in their previous unfair situation and would share its findings with Mr Shapps’ office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The association agreed to meet with Mr Shapps in March saying that its representative would apologise in person, and that it would put itself on the “appropriate footing” to work with him going forward. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councillor Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of the residents of Ashley court, will also attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Hebden said of the recent good news: “This is a fantastic step forward for the residents. There are other issues to be resolved but if Sanctuary Housing are adopting a new resident-focussed stance then I’m a lot more optimistic”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps gave his own thoughts on the matter adding: “This is a great result for the residents of Ashley Court, and I’m incredibly happy to have been part of the effort to facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As Councillor Hebden has said, this is a step forward for the residents, and I’m sure that our meeting with Sanctuary Housing will yield further results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Putting residents in such an unfair situation was unacceptable, so I’m hoping that this outcome will go some way to putting their minds at ease.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <title>City Council Leader Responds to “Levelling Up” Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/02/02/city-council-leader-responds-to-levelling-up-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>). The latest business grants for businesses affected by the recent restrictions are now available through the local Council, which you can find <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/">here</a>. For constituents self-isolating who are struggling financially, there is also the £500 self-isolation NHS Test &amp; Trace Support payment, which you can find further details on the eligibility criteria for <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/benefits/test-and-trace-support-payment/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/benefits/test-and-trace-support-payment/">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients.

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
