&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has said that Rishi Sunak’s Tory budget is a missed opportunity which will leave many people disappointed and definitely doesn’t address the damage of Brexit, far less to deal with Covid properly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Mr MacNeil said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This again was a budget for big business, wheeler dealers and people who believe Covid will be history by the summer. In Scotland we are a country of medium sized businesses, honest traders and people who accept the reality of Covid which means this budget did little for us in Scotland. We also know that the worst affected part of Europe by the Tories crazy Brexit idea is the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The budget definitely did nothing for that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One thing the budget does show is that Governments such as the UK Government, who print their own currency,&amp;nbsp; can and will print that currency and shake what is called the magic money tree. This only underlines the wasted decade of Tory austerity when so much could have been done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The budget sadly gives nothing new to the NHS or the education system. For as long as Scotland remains devolved it is not going to see the funds to help these essential public services as a result. As in devolution, Scotland&amp;#8217;s spending is a consequence of the choices of Westminster. Fortunately for the likes of Portugal, Ireland, or Norway their spending choices are not dictated to by their immediate neighbours.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On Universal Credit, money that is the most recycled in the economy, it is already at a very low base compared to countries like Ireland, which is why footballers like Marcus Rashford become politically involved in trying to prevent malnutrition in children in a western country. The £20 uplift is indeed meagre, and it is very miserly to only say it is for 6 months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sadly, the UK government could not match the Scottish government which has already gone much further in support for businesses and households, with 100% rates relief, Council Tax frozen and a 5-year capital investment plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only way for Scotland to get what it votes for is to firstly vote for independence. If we continue like this, we will just end up training yet another generation that what we have to cope with is extremist economics from the Tory party in bad times and in good.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dunne welcomes Budget to protect jobs and fire up economy </title>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dunne welcomes Budget to protect jobs and fire up economy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;South Shropshire MP, Philip Dunne, has welcomed today’s Budget from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to protect jobs and deliver growth for businesses as the UK recovers from the covid19 pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To protect jobs and support businesses, the Chancellor announced the furlough scheme will be extended to September, alongside two further grants for the Self Employed, which will now be open to those who started a new business in 2019/20, as long as they have submitted a tax return for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;New Recovery Loans and a new Restart grant of up to £18,000 to help businesses as they reopen. Support for the sports, arts and culture sectors will also be increased by a further £700 million as they begin to reopen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Business Rates continue to be zero rated for an additional three months, before tapering at 12.5% for a further 9 months, before returning to normal levels. The VAT cut for hospitality and tourism businesses, which is a big help for these businesses in South Shropshire when they are open, will remain at 5% for 6 months, and then will taper through a 12.5% rate for the following 6 months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a major boost for business investment in plant and machinery the Chancellor is introducing a new Super Deduction of 130% of this investment offsetable against tax bills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alcohol and fuel duty have had their planned duty increase scrapped. The inheritance, capital gains and pensions lifetime allowances &amp; the VAT threshold will remain at current levels, with no increase to income tax, National Insurance Contributions or VAT. The uplift to Universal Credit and Working Tax Credits will be extended by six months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr Dunne said: “The Chancellor has once again shown his willingness to innovate, and I am pleased there was so much for South Shropshire to welcome in today’s Budget. I had called for furlough to be extended until at least June, so I am pleased it has been further extended out to September, with additional support for the self-employed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee, I had called for policies to help the UK meet its environmental obligations. The major boost to business investment through a Super Deduction capital allowance for the next two years will help business invest in newer, cleaner, technology. While I welcome announcements to develop Freeports and growth hubs including hydrogen projects, limited investment in offshore wind port infrastructure and the lack of VAT reductions for green sectors to drive growth in areas such as energy efficiency represent a missed opportunity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Green Finance measures, I had called for the Bank of England remit to be extended to reflect the transition to net zero Britain, which is very welcome. It must now set out before the COP26 summit the steps it will take to reduce the carbon footprint of its corporate bond portfolio. In addition to confirmation of Green Gilts to be issued, launch of environmental retail savings products will help develop the City of London’s leadership in carbon offset markets trading. The £12 billion investment in the new UK Infrastructure Bank to invest in public and private projects, will also help drive green growth and create green jobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is more that will be needed. But this overall package of support is good news for South Shropshire and the country as we seek to move from pandemic to recovery.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The stamp duty cut will be extended for another three months, before tapering for another three, to help reduce the cliff edge being faced in the housing market. A new mortgage guarantee scheme will help young people in Shropshire get onto the housing ladder with a 5% deposit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2021/03/budget-is-good-news-for-businesses-jobs-and-families-in-worcester/"><![CDATA[<p>Worcester MP Robin Walker has welcomed the Spring Budget as good news for businesses, jobs and families in the constituency. The budget provides billions of pounds to support businesses and families through the pandemic, delivers on the promises made by the Conservatives to the British people during the election and invests in the UK’s future economy.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Government set out an ambitious plan that focuses on supporting people and businesses through this moment of crisis – well beyond the end of the roadmap – to ensure they have the security and stability they need.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Budget are measures which will build our future economy, levelling up across all regions of the United Kingdom and spreading opportunity everywhere.</p>
<p>As part of the Government’s commitments to fund the nation’s priorities, the Budget confirmed:</p>
<ol>
<li> An extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September, ensuring it continues to support employers as they begin to reopen. Two further grants will also be available to self-employed people – and those newly self-employed will also be eligible for both of these.</li>
<li> A continuation of the £20 Universal Credit uplift for a further six months, with a one-off payment of £500 for those claiming Working Tax Credits.</li>
<li> Support for providing young people with new skills: including doubling the incentive payment to SMEs to take on apprentices of any age to £3,000, and £126 million to triple the number of traineeships next year.</li>
<li>An increase to the National Living Wage of £8.91 – the equivalent of £350 working full time on the National Living Wage.</li>
<li>New Recovery Loans and a new Restart grant of up to £18,000 to help businesses as they reopen. Support for the sports, arts and culture sectors will also be increased by a further £700 million as they begin to reopen.</li>
<li> Extending the business rates holiday, VAT cut and stamp duty holiday. There will also be a new mortgage guarantee scheme from April which backs 95 per cent mortgages – helping those with smaller deposits.</li>
<li>Opening up the new Levelling Up Fund for its first round of bids, worth £4.8 billion across the United Kingdom. Worcester will be one of the first towns to receive support in bidding for this funding.</li>
<li> Launching the first ever UK Infrastructure Bank to invest in public and private projects to drive green growth and create green jobs.</li>
<li> A new Help to Grow scheme to boost productivity of small businesses, to ensure they are embracing the latest technology and management training.</li>
<li>Being honest with the British people about the need to fix the public finances. We are standing by our manifesto pledge not to increase Income Tax, NICs or VAT and we are freezing alcohol duty, and fuel duty for the 11th year in a row. However, in order to fix the public finances, corporation tax on large company profits will increase to 25 per cent in 2023. Small businesses will continue to be taxed at 19% and this will be tapered for medium sized ones and 70 per cent of businesses will be completely unaffected.</li>
</ol>
<p>Commenting, Robin said:</p>
<p>“In advance of today’s budget I hoped for a commitment to families, jobs and businesses in Worcester and that is what the Chancellor has delivered.</p>
<p>“I was glad to see cross party support from Worcester city council for the Conservative government’s furlough, self employed income support scheme and the extra money we have invested in supporting people on universal credit and having raised all these issues with the chancellor ahead of his budget, I was pleased to see that he has delivered extensions on all three.”</p>
<p>“As well as an extension of the furlough scheme which will directly protect jobs and help keep businesses afloat, the £20 uplift in universal credit has been extended by a further six months, and claimants of Working Tax Credits will receive a one off payment of £500.</p>
<p>“I also welcome the Chancellor’s commitment to our pledge to level up opportunity across the United Kingdom, as he pledged £150,000 to help Worcester apply to a £4.8 billion fund that can make a real difference to our city.”</p>
<p>“Of course it is right that revenue needs to be raised to pay back the unprecedented levels of support that this government has delivered to our economy during a time of crisis and I think it is right to do this from a combination of growth and carefully targeted taxation. The changes to corporation tax and the freezing of personal allowances at the levels we set out to achieve in our manifesto are sensible steps to achieve this whilst protecting small businesses and those on lower incomes.”</p>
<p>“I was elected on a commitment to level up opportunity to Worcester and areas like ours, and this budget will help deliver on that, while helping families and businesses get through the Covid challenges and grow our economy in the years to come.”</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak MP said:</p>
<p>“Throughout this pandemic, my top priority has been to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods. Today’s Budget reaffirms this commitment, with £407 billion to support the British people this year and next as one of the largest, most comprehensive and sustained responses this country has ever seen.</p>
<p>“It is thanks to successive Conservative governments that we have been able to respond to this crisis as boldly as we have. But we need to be honest about the challenges facing our public finances, and how we will begin to fix them.</p>
<p>“As we look ahead, this Budget lays the foundations of our future economy – driving up productivity, creating green jobs, supporting small businesses, and levelling up across the entire United Kingdom”.</p>

    <title>Birmingham faces the biggest levelling up challenge in the UK</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/birmingham-faces-biggest-levelling-challenge-uk" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak MP, will have delivered his budget but we need to make sure that it is fair and doesn’t see Birmingham left behind. </p>
<p>Our city has enjoyed neither the prosperous Conservative cronyism of the south nor the solidarity of northern cities. Rather, the UK’s second city has its own identity, as the leading economy of the Midlands. But what does that mean in real terms?</p>
<p>When it comes to today’s budget, this puts us at great risk of being left behind by the Government’s levelling up agenda.</p>
<p>Last month, the Centre for Cities published its Cities Outlook 2021 which showed that Birmingham is the city facing the biggest levelling up challenge in the country. Following a decade of austerity and underinvestment compared to other regions, Birmingham went into this pandemic with weakened foundations that is now having a direct impact on families across the city. </p>
<p>Our city has since been hit disproportionately by Covid, with high infection rates and some of the highest hospital admissions in Europe, pinballing between varying degrees of restrictions, and forcing businesses to close. Our city now has one of the worst unemployment rates in the country, which Centre for Cities proposes would need to be reduced by 6.7% in order for Birmingham to be levelled up and put on an equal footing with the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Compounding these astonishing challenges, Birmingham has continually lost out under this Conservative government:</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
	The Conservative West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street’s own analysis shows that he has secured just 5% of the £3.2bn government investment for which the West Midlands Combined Authority bid.
	</li>
<li dir="ltr">
	The British Business Bank’s Future Fund for start-up funding has seen business in London receive nearly 29 times more than the West Midlands. 
	</li>
<li dir="ltr">
	Per capita, support for our culture sector from the Culture Recovery Fund is the lowest of any region in England.
	</li>
<li dir="ltr">
	West Midlands Police is penalised by the police allocation formula, and the promised 1,200 new officers will not make up the 2,200 lost in the preceding decade. Violent crime meanwhile has doubled in three years. 
	</li>
<li dir="ltr">
	Across my constituency of Edgbaston, when it comes to connectivity, 2% of premises do not even have 10mbps download speeds compared to the national average of 1.4%, with clusters of broadband blackspots in the most deprived areas like Bartley Green. Action on the digital divide has been pushed back time and again.
	</li>
<li dir="ltr">
	Despite promises that the Government would do “whatever it takes” to support councils, Birmingham City Council is now facing a £100m budget black hole.
	</li>
</ul><p>If you were to look at any of these points on a singular basis, it could be easy to disregard the city as occasionally missing out. However, that is why it is so important that we look at the levelling up agenda holistically. When you look at the bigger picture, it is blatantly clear how the Centre for Cities has such significant risks for our city.</p>
<p>This can’t go on, and we need the Government to make good on its promise to level up the left behind areas of our country. </p>
<p>We need investment in transport infrastructure; in training to get young people who have been so badly hit by this crisis back into education, or work as proposed in Labour’s Jobs Promise; and funding to create new jobs and attract investment in our city. </p>
<p>As Liam Byrne has laid out in detail, this should start with accelerating green investment in our region, as well as providing proper support to Birmingham’s vibrant cultural sector to ensure it is prepared to make the most of the opportunities afforded by the Commonwealth Games next year.</p>
<p>It is crucial that the National Infrastructure Bank, the Levelling Up Fund and UK Share Prosperity Fund have the financial clout to help places like Birmingham recover and rebuild following this crisis. </p>
<p>As the UK’s second city, Birmingham has the people, the expertise, the diversity and community resilience to bounce back from this crisis, but after years of underinvestment and now Covid, we need to see action, not more promises, from Conservative administrations on levelling up. </p>
<p>Today, we must see the start of a vision that meets the task of our times, unlocks opportunity for my constituents, and finally gives Birmingham and the West Midlands a fair share. </p>

    <title>The Budget – this year’s borrowing down £39bn from last forecast</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/03/03/the-budget-this-years-borrowing-down-39bn-from-last-forecast/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected the OBR cut their forecast of borrowing in the year to March 2021. They have lopped £39bn off the total compared to the November forecast and may still find their figure a bit high with only one month left to go. In contrast they have raised their borrowing forecast for 2021-22, partly to reflect the extension of measures announced in  the budget to cushion  some of the effects of continuing lock downs and social distancing policies. They wisely stress the difficulties of forecasting given the big impact lock down policies have on jobs and business. They rightly draw attention to the fall in debt interest thanks to low interest rates and the purchase of state debt by the state owned Bank of England. It seems to me premature to form a view of what might be needed to control the deficit in a few years time when it is so clear that the deficit is massively swelled by the impact of anti pandemic spending and some loss of tax revenue from less output and income. As their figures confirm it will take a vigorous recovery to get the deficit down, but only a good recovery can straighten out the public finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the budget needs to  be judged by how big an impact will it have on that recovery?  My questions include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When will the Freeports be up and running? Will the areas demarked be substantial? How generous will the tax and tariff reductions be? I strongly support a Freeport led recovery but to be effective they need to be available soon, to be given good incentives  and cover substantial areas. There are some proposals in  the Red Book with issues still to settle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will the supercharged investment allowances work? What is the net effect on a potential inward investor of the improved allowance against the higher CT rate stated to come in in 2023?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What more will the government do to back the self employed and small business, as they will be crucial to recovery given their flexibility and enterprise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What plans does the government have to address the issue of productivity performance, which affects the longer term growth rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will develop these and related themes tomorrow as part of the budget debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting on the Spring Budget 2021, Denton and Reddish MP Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are living in extraordinary times and we needed a bold, forward-thinking Budget to support our recovery from this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Whilst there are lots of eye-catching announcements &amp;#8211; some of which are very welcome &amp;#8211; the Chancellor has completely failed to meet the challenge of producing a Budget to support a long-term plan for rebuilding our economy and our country after a disastrous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I welcome the extension of furlough and the business support. However, beyond freezing tax allowances, which in effect brings more people into paying tax, or paying at higher rates, there was little to explain how hundreds of billions of pounds will be paid back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve always taken the view it should be parked and treated in the same way as Second World War debts were; paying back over generations, so not to impact on day-to-day spending on our public services, or on capital and infrastructure spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The crisis has shown the terrible consequences of over a decade of the Tories slashing public services, but the Chancellor has missed an opportunity to reinvest and rebuild these services, instead focusing on some tokenistic moves that he&amp;#8217;s spinning as &amp;#8220;levelling up&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The social care crisis remains unresolved, despite countless promises from the Government that they have a plan, and our brilliant key workers will have no reward for their work keeping the country going over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hundreds of thousands remain excluded from any Covid support schemes and many thousands more face bankruptcy as the Chancellor refuses to properly tackle the cladding and fire safety crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Looking beyond the headlines, flashy videos and spin, this Budget was just a very expensive way of kicking the can down the road. Unfortunately, it still remains unclear what the Government&amp;#8217;s strategy is to get our economy back on track.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Graham Stuart MP lobbies Minister for Schools hard to include Hornsea School in future rounds of funding for the School Rebuilding Programme</title>

<p>Local MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, had a virtual catch up with Headteacher of Hornsea School and Language College (HSLC), Steve Ostler, and the Chair of Governors, Graham McDonald, after the Government confirmed all pupils were set to return to school on 8 March, as part of their roadmap for leaving lockdown.</p>
<p>Graham heard about the school’s plans to welcome pupils back in March, particularly their impressive testing regime, which they are aiming to have available daily, including weekends. Steve emphasised that 80% of the school community has opted in for the testing they are offering.</p>
<p>They also discussed the Government’s ten-year School Rebuilding Programme from which Steve is hoping to secure funding to upgrade existing buildings and for new buildings. On 5 February, the first 50 schools were confirmed for the first wave of funding. Unfortunately, HSLC was not included. Nonetheless, Graham is determined to lobby the Schools Minister to ensure HSLC is included in upcoming rounds. Graham will visit the school to see exactly what work needs to be done.</p>
<p>Graham Stuart said, “I am delighted to hear that Steve and his team are going above and beyond with their weekend testing plans for their school community, and I applaud their enthusiasm to welcome pupils back to school next week – I wish them every success.</p>
<p>“I know they are disappointed not to make the first round of funding for the School Rebuilding Programme, but I will continue to lobby the Minister to include them in future rounds of funding and I am looking forward to visiting the school very soon.”</p>
<p>Steve said, “I really appreciate Graham having a catch up with us so we could update him on our progress. We are really looking forward to welcoming the kids back next week – I think the quicker we get them back, the better for everyone concerned.</p>
<p>“Inevitably we are disappointed not to be included in the first round for the Rebuilding Programme, but I am thrilled that Graham will be coming to visit the school and I am grateful for the work he is putting in to help us secure funding.”</p>
<p>Graham McDonald said, “It was great to chat with Graham again and I am delighted he is keen to visit the school, so we can show him the work needs to be done.”</p>

    <title>Chancellor urged to use budget to tackle the ever widening divide between the South of England and the rest of the country</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor has the opportunity in his budget to tackle some of the long standing economic and social issues that are holding back towns and cities across the Midlands and the North. He and his Party has spoken much of levelling up, but over the past decade of successive Conservative Governments, inequality across the country has risen and a number of long standing issues have been left unchecked.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As Nottingham and the rest of the country looks to emerge from the Covid crisis it’s more important than ever that policy and action from the Government matches the rhetoric. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Covid effect on the UK has been significantly worse than all of our comparator nations, both in terms of the economic downturn and the Covid death rate. Covid has exposed significant wealth and health inequalities that are sadly more pronounced in the UK than most other developed nations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK Covid death rate per head of population has been one of the highest in the world &lt;a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/highest-rates-excess-deaths-in-the-world-ons-deaths-data-2020"&gt;https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/highest-rates-excess-deaths-in-the-world-ons-deaths-data-2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The impact of Covid has been much more significant in more financially deprived communities and amongst black and other minority ethnic groups &lt;a href="https://www.nhsconfed.org/resources/2020/12/perspectives-from-the-front-line-disproportionate-impact-covid-19-bme-communities"&gt;https://www.nhsconfed.org/resources/2020/12/perspectives-from-the-front-line-disproportionate-impact-covid-19-bme-communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The economic downturn in the UK has also been one of the most severe in the world. OECD statistics show that the UK has suffered the biggest economic decline of all major developed nations in recent reporting &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55143285"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55143285&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
Chancellor has an opportunity now to deal with some of the big structural
issues that have been damaging to the health and wealth of vast swathes of the
population for far too long. I’d urge the Chancellor to use his budget to begin
to deal with regional inequality, health inequality, skills inequality and
wealth inequality as well as investing in sustainability and environmental
projects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My
key asks of the Chancellor:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the £20 Universal Credit uplift permanent&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More investment in regional transport infrastructure. The East Midlands has the lowest transport infrastructure in the country at just £268 per head in 2019 compared to £903 per head in London. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50592261"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50592261&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give a pay increase to Britain’s heroic key workers. Our front line key workers such as care workers, nurses, bin lorry crews and park rangers are the true heroes of the Covid crisis and they deserve much more than a pay freeze that will see their income reduce in real terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop the vast majority of Council Tax increases that come from the Government’s adult social care precept by introducing a new, national funding formula for care services for the elderly. For many years Government has committed to introduce a new system of funding, but to date this hasn’t happened. The effect of the 3% adult social care precept is that council tax bills continue to rise at a time when many households are already struggling with their finances. &lt;a href="https://www.lgcplus.com/politics/lgc-briefing/councils-must-not-be-forgotten-in-the-council-funding-debate-16-02-2021/"&gt;https://www.lgcplus.com/politics/lgc-briefing/councils-must-not-be-forgotten-in-the-council-funding-debate-16-02-2021/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reform business rates urgently and extend the business rates holiday so that businesses have the ability to recover as Covid restrictions ease. For too long high street traders have been punished while online businesses are effectively incentivised unnecessarily. Right now retailers and hospitality businesses with buildings on our high streets in towns and city centres across the country are fighting for survival. The unfairness of the business rates system must be tackled to protect businesses and jobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop the cuts to council services that are happening across the country by honouring the pledge to refund councils in full for the costs of Covid. At this very moment Councils are having to balance their budgets for the next financial year whilst still in the midst of the pandemic and the social and economic consequences of it. Key workers are losing their jobs and essential local public services are under threat of cuts or closure because of the combination of reductions in Government funding over the past decade plus the significant unreimbursed costs of Covid. In Nottingham the unfunded Covid cost currently stands at £29million for this financial year alone.  With Councils legally obliged to set balanced budgets with no deficit each and every year there is no way out of service and job cuts without Government support and right now is the worst possible time to inflict further damage to local communities. &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/ps10-billion-spending-review-investment-needed-protect-and-improve-local-services"&gt;https://www.local.gov.uk/ps10-billion-spending-review-investment-needed-protect-and-improve-local-services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
Chancellor has the ability to tackle many of these long standing issues in his
budget. There are huge opportunities post Covid, but the Chancellor must act to
reform the policies that hold far too many communities back. I know that many
people will be watching closely to see if he does. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Families in Bristol South face a triple hammer blow to their finances unless Chancellor changes course at the Budget</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/03/02/2871/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=2871" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Families in Bristol South face a triple hammer blow to their finances unless Chancellor changes course at the Budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to hit families in Bristol South with a triple blow of council tax hikes, frozen pay and cuts to social security at his Budget this week.&amp;nbsp; With Britain in the grip of the worst economic crisis of any major economy, Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is urging the Chancellor to change course to protect family finances and get Britain on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor’s plan to slash Universal Credit by £20 a week from April means 11,764 people in Bristol South will take a £1,040 a year hit to their finances.&amp;nbsp; Sunak also wants families to pay for gaps in council budgets through council tax hikes rather than fulfilling his pledge to back them.&amp;nbsp; This could amount to £102 extra on annual council tax bills for the average Band D home in Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor is also hitting 7,500 public sector workers earning over £18,000 in Bristol South with a real term pay cut this year, affecting the teachers, police officers and Armed Forces personnel on the front line of the pandemic.&amp;nbsp; Karin Smyth has condemned this triple hammer blow to people’s pockets as totally irresponsible when the economy is so fragile, and is calling on the government to scrap its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As our country suffers from the worst economic crisis of any major economy, it is crucial that steps are taken to back Bristol’s recovery and support those who so desperately need it. Yet the Chancellor’s plans to implement a triple hammer blow of cuts to Universal Credit, council tax hikes and pay freezes risks sabotaging Bristol’s recovery before it has even begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Chancellor’s plans are economically illiterate, and will only cause more businesses and families in Bristol South to suffer.&amp;nbsp; Instead of wasting billions on private contracts, the Government should be spending more on protecting people’s livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also need to see action clean energy and our environment &amp;#8211; not new coal mines like those proposed by Ministers. And across South Bristol, there must finally be meaningful investment in skills and opportunities for those looking for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the moment to create a secure and prosperous economy for the future.&amp;nbsp; The Chancellor must reconsider his damaging plans and focus on protecting family finances and investing in our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;The post &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/03/02/2871/"&gt;Families in Bristol South face a triple hammer blow to their finances unless Chancellor changes course at the Budget&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="http://karinsmyth.com"&gt;Karin Smyth&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Barking and Dagenham and Havering have a proud history of manufacturing industries that helped drive Britain’s prosperity and place in the world, but this did not come without a price. Whilst the factories such as Cape Asbestos in Barking town centre closed many years ago, the long-term impacts of diseases such as mesothelioma are still impacting the local community.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Jon Cruddas MP has long fought for the families, often the widows, of workers who suffered as a result of working with asbestos. From 2006 to the end of 2010 Havering’s death rate for mesothelioma was nearly double the national average. Jon was at the forefront of the campaign which established the ‘fund of last resort’ in 2014 which provides compensation to workers and families affected by mesothelioma.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This compensation scheme is up for review on 1st April 2021. At present the compensation scheme does not provide adequate support for family members who became victims of this terrible disease when their spouses or parents came home from work carrying on asbestos fibres on their clothes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>Jon Cruddas MP:</strong>
                <em> “this review of the ‘fund of last resort’ is welcome and is an opportunity for the scheme to be properly updated to offer wider support for families of workers. In the coming days I will be working with other Labour MPs calling for justice, and equal compensation for the families who have suffered as a direct result of asbestos related work.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>“It’s great that we celebrate Britain’s industrial history, but we need to also remember that much of our success came at a cost to the workers and families who delivered it. Families across Dagenham and Rainham and those in other working-class communities suffering from mesothelioma deserve a more comprehensive support package.”</em>

    <title>RELEASE: Drew Hendry MP &amp; Jason Isaacs Support Marie Curie ‘s 35th Great Daffodil Appeal</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Drew Hendry MP, Chair of the UK Government All-Party Parliamentary Group for Terminal Illness, and Harry Potter actor, Jason Isaacs, have joined forces to support end of life charity Marie Curie provide care and support to more people living with a terminal illness.</p>
<p>Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey MP Drew Hendry and Marie Curie Ambassador Jason Isaacs, are backing the Great Daffodil Appeal, Marie Curie’s biggest annual fundraising campaign held every March. The campaign, which reached its 35<sup>th</sup> anniversary in March, has for the first time, had to cancel all of the public collections, leaving the charity with a potential loss of over £3 million.</p>
<p>The last 12 months have been extremely difficult as key fundraising events have been cancelled and all Marie Curie’s charity shops have had to close. Last year, the charity saw a 16.5% rise in the number of people they cared for at end of life, compared to 2019 and their support line saw a 20% increase in calls too.</p>
<p>Drew has pledged his support to the Great Daffodil Appeal and is encouraging constituents in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey to donate and wear one of the charity’s daffodil pins to help fund vital care and support for people living with a terminal illness, and their families, in a year where Marie Curie have been on the frontline providing care to people dying both with and without coronavirus.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mr Hendry said:</p>
<p>“I am delighted to support Marie Curie’s Great Daffodil Appeal this March. I work closely with Marie Curie as part of my ongoing work as Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Terminal Illness and the work they do to support people at the end of their lives, and their families, is remarkable.</p>
<p>“Every five minutes, someone in the UK dies without getting the care and support they need at the end of their life, and this last year has been a stark reminder to us all of just how valuable end of life care and support is, that’s why I’m supporting this appeal and asking my constituents to do the same.”</p>
<p>Jason, who became a Marie Curie Ambassador in 2018, said:</p>
<p>“Marie Curie does amazing things, and when people don’t have the family members around, they provide love. Towards the end of life, they help the end to be as serene and beautiful and loving as it can be. The work Marie Curie do is needed now more than ever as the Covid-19 pandemic has had a big impact on their ability to fundraise.</p>
<p>“So, I’m here to support them and the Great Daffodil Appeal and encourage everyone to wear their daffodil or join in fundraising any way they can as every donation means that when the time comes, Marie Curie can be there for people and their loved ones when they need it most.  For anyone who chooses to support them too, you’re supporting a really wonderful charity.”</p>
<p>Ruth Driscoll, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Marie Curie, said:</p>
<p>“Having the support of Drew and Jason makes a huge difference to our Great Daffodil Appeal, which we need people to support more than ever this year.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, our nurses, doctors and other staff have been on the frontline providing care for people dying both with and without coronavirus. But still too many people miss out on the care and support they need at the end of life.</p>
<p>“By donating and wearing a daffodil pin in March you are helping us to support more people at the most difficult time of their lives. We want to make sure that everyone affected by terminal illness, wherever they may live, gets the right support, at the right time – whether that is high quality nursing care, emotional and practical support, or fast access to the benefits they need.”</p>
<p>During the Great Daffodil Appeal the first annual National Day of Reflection will take place. Since the first lockdown began in 2020, millions of people have been bereaved. Join Marie Curie on 23 March, the first anniversary of UK lockdown, for a day to reflect and commemorate this tragic loss of life.</p>

    <title>Press release:- Newcastle MP demands the Chancellor use the budget to close gaps in support.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/03/press-release-newcastle-mp-demands-the-chancellor-use-the-budget-to-close-gaps-in-support/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Wednesdays budget Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah has written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak to demand action over those excluded from covid-19 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 13th Chi held a digital town hall in Newcastle Central for businesses and constituents who have not been able to access the support they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi said “&lt;em&gt;At my town hall I heard from a Newcastle business that had been forced into administration and others that received no support since the pandemic began. Millions of people have been excluded from all support during the pandemic with thousands in my constituency alone. People are being left behind through no fault of their own, and viable businesses are going under because of government inaction. Exclusion from support is having a significant impact on the mental health of so many people and their families, it is also damaging to the local economy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chi’s letter to Rishi Sunak: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Rishi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; February I held a digital town hall meeting for individuals and businesses in Newcastle Central that have been excluded from covid support. At this meeting I heard about the significant impact that exclusion has had on my constituents and the significant gaps that remain in the Government’s support package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town hall raised a number of questions for yourself. I am writing to you to request answers for my constituents to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of Covid 19 support for the coach sector has forced a coach business in my constituency into insolvency. The owner and director is now concerned about the impact this insolvency will have on his position as a director at another firm. Can you reassure him that his position at his other firm will not be impacted by this insolvency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like many businesspeople across the country the director of a rail travel firm in my constituency has been forced to take out thousands of pounds of loans secured against personal assets to ensure the survival of the business. These directors need to know what support and reassurances you will offer them with regards to their personal liabilities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A takeaway sandwich business in my constituency, dependent on the footfall from local school children, does not have a business bank account, because of this they have been excluded from the bounce back loan scheme. What steps are you taking to help those in this situation gain access to the bounce back loan scheme?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The funding provided to local authorities such as Newcastle City Council is described as discretionary but local authorities do not have full discretion over how it is awarded. For example, some grants are only accessible by businesses forced to close. Will you make more funding available which can be accessed by all businesses impacted by the pandemic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A public sector employee whose job was impacted by Covid19 was made redundant and told that furlough was not an option in the public sector. What alternative provisions are there to support public sector employees?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2020 you stated that the Government will do ‘whatever it takes’ to help UK workers and businesses. However, I am concerned that a year later there are still people and businesses in my constituency that do not have access to the support that they need. I look forward to receiving your answers to my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi Onwurah                                                                                 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 General Debate 22/02/2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2021/02/25/lockdown-easing/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This week I took part in the Parliamentary debate on COVID-19, following the Prime Minister&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;roadmap out of lockdown&amp;#8217; announcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I opened by paying tribute to all those involved in delivering the vaccine across the 4 nations of the UK, including healthcare staff, volunteers and the armed forces. At the time of my contribution, 1,445,488 first doses of the vaccine had been administered in Scotland alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public Health Scotland&amp;#8217;s initial data shows a vaccine effectiveness rate of between 84% and 94% in reducing Covid-related hospitalisations; welcome news indeed. However, we must still proceed cautiously and do everything we can do suppress the virus as moving too fast simply risks it remaining in circulation and mutating into new, vaccine resistant strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was, therefore, concerned when the PM, despite promising to focus on &amp;#8216;data rather than dates&amp;#8217;, nonetheless proceeded to announce a long list of dates whereby they hope to lift various restrictions, and still without ensuring certain basic measures are in place, including the provision of an effective &amp;#8216;test, trace, isolate and SUPPORT&amp;#8217; system as lockdown restrictions are eased and tightening travel restrictions for those coming into the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that you either choose public health or you choose the economy is a false dichotomy as we know from other countries which have successfully followed elimination strategies that acting quickly and stringently with Covid allows for the safe re-opening of more economic sectors at earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can watch my full contribution to the debate here: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww-Fvwx_zcc"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww-Fvwx_zcc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dr Philippa Whitford MP&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we move into the second year of covid, and despite still being in lockdown, there are key positives to be celebrated. The vaccine roll-out is progressing quickly, and staff in all four national health services should be congratulated, along with the Army, who have provided logistical expertise, and the thousands of volunteers who have helped to ensure the safety and organisation of vaccination centres. Vaccine uptake has been way above expectations and, with the hope that vaccination will prevent viral transmission as well as protecting the recipient, everyone who rolls up their sleeve is contributing to the fight against the pandemic. However, concerns remain about lower vaccine uptake among certain groups, including some who are particularly vulnerable to covid, such as BAME communities. Anyone offered the vaccine should take up their appointment. If they have questions, there is information on the NHS websites, or they can ask their local GP practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, any increase in covid cases has led to an inevitable rise in hospitalisation and deaths just a few weeks later, but as more vulnerable groups are vaccinated, that is starting to change. We are already seeing the benefit to those who were vaccinated first in Scotland. An analysis of over 1 million vaccine recipients by Public Health Scotland has today revealed a reduction in hospitalisation of between 85% and 94% for the two vaccines. Owing to its integrated structure, Scotland’s NHS was able to get permission from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to deliver the Pfizer vaccine to all elderly care homes from 13 December. That has led to a 62% drop in deaths among residents throughout January. That dramatic fall will, we hope, be replicated in data across the rest of the UK in just the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Prime Minister has highlighted, one possible threat to the success of the vaccination programme would be the importation of a more vaccine-resistant variant, such as that which has arisen in South Africa and has already been shown to be resistant to antibodies from those who have recovered from covid. This threat makes it inexplicable that when the UK Government have finally decided to set up monitored border quarantine, it is on such a limited basis—so much for following the science! There should be mandatory quarantine for arrivals from all countries, as there is nothing to prevent someone from travelling from South Africa or Brazil via a third country. The South African variant is already present in at least 35 other countries and new variants could be evolving as we speak. The Government’s suggestion that people will be able to travel abroad for summer holidays seems to be courting danger, as many countries will not be vaccinated and therefore pose an increased risk that holidaymakers would bring back new variants; surely this is a sacrifice we could all accept if it allowed children to be in school and our domestic economy to open up. This measure must, however, be combined with support for the aviation, aerospace and international tourism sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Prime Minister’s road map out of lockdown, I welcomed the suggestion that decisions that would be based on data rather than dates, but he then proceeded to announce a whole list of dates. Although it is good to see cases falling so dramatically across the UK, from almost 60,000 a day to just over 11,000 a day, case levels are still more than double what they were when SAGE&amp;nbsp;called for a lockdown on 21 September. The number of covid patients in hospital is 10 times what it was last September and only just dropped below the peak of the first wave last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Scotland has maintained lower case levels throughout the second and third waves, progress in all four nations is slowing, and this is thought to be due to the greater infectiousness of the B117 Kent variant. Thankfully, this variant appears to be just as sensitive to the immune response induced by current vaccines, but every time the virus spreads and replicates itself, there is an opportunity for mutation and the risk of a problematic domestic variant emerging, including one that might be resistant to our current vaccines. The UK has already faced three waves of covid and three lockdowns, and it is important that current restrictions remain until case levels have been driven low enough to give the vaccine programme a chance to succeed and health services time to recover. It is not a matter of setting the economy against public health; it is through stopping community spread that we would be able to get our domestic economy and society back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once covid levels have been brought down, it is critical to have an effective system to test, trace and isolate those who could be carrying the virus, in order to keep control of the outbreak. Unfortunately, one in eight cases are still not being reached by NHS Test and Trace, and surveys suggest that as few as one in three people are isolating when required. The commonest reason is that they cannot afford to lose their income, yet more than half of those applying for the Government’s support payment are being turned down, which makes it very unlikely that they would then isolate. The Government need to widen the eligibility criteria and review the level of payment, which is less than the minimum wage. It is in everyone’s interest to ensure that those who could be carrying the virus isolate so we avoid onward spread. All these measures carry a cost, but when we see the flourishing domestic economies of the countries that acted quickly and stringently last year, we can see the cost of not taking action, both in lives and in economic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			<p>A new report by a cross party group of MPs as part of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Health in All Policies which I Chair has concluded that, five years on, the effect of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/7/contents/enacted">Welfare Reform &amp; Work Act 2016</a> has been ‘devastating’ to the health and wellbeing of people on low incomes.</p>
<p>The report which was launched today <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf"> can be read here.</a></p>
<p>This<a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf"> report</a> shows there is strong evidence from several sources that the cuts in social security support have contributed to increasing poverty and financial hardship in low income households which has particularly affected the poverty levels of children and disabled people.</p>
<p>The analysis has found overwhelming evidence showing how the Act has pushed many low income households into poverty and financial hardship, disproportionately affecting children and disabled people. The report describes the strong evidence showing the adverse causal relationship that this poverty has had on the health and well-being of those affected, particularly children, with every 1% increase in child poverty associated with an extra 5.8 infant deaths per 100,000 and a third of the increases in infant mortality between 2014 and 2017 attributed to rising poverty.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf">report</a> also reveals how the treatment of those people reliant on social security by the Department for Work and Pensions often leaves them feeling worthless and even ‘dehumanised’.</p>
<p>Looking at 5 specific measures within the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Act – the benefit cap, the benefit freeze, the two child limit, the abolition of £30 a week support for disabled people who were unfit for work (ESA WRAG) and the extension of sanctions to ‘responsible carers’ (parents of pre-nursery age children) – the APPG inquiry sought to identify the impacts of  these specific measures on household income and the impact that this may have on the behaviour and health of claimants and their families in the context of the 2012 social security cuts, and other wider ranging tax and public service changes.</p>
<p>The APPG also looked at the Government’s objectives for the 2016 Act to see how effective the measures had been in achieving these objectives and has made 16 recommendations including</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the social safety net sufficient for people not in full-time work to receive a minimum income for healthy living</li>
<li>Making permanent the £1,000-a-year increase in the standard allowance for Universal Credit</li>
<li>Removing sanctions and reduce conditionalities in benefit payments</li>
<li>Eradicating benefit caps and lifting the two-child limit</li>
<li>Providing tapering levels of benefits to avoid cliff edges</li>
<li>Ending the five-week wait for Universal Credit and providing cash grants for low-income households</li>
<li>Giving sufficient Government support to food aid providers and charities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2015 we looked at the <em>potential</em> impacts of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill on child poverty and health, and we wanted to compare these with the <em>actual</em> impacts. Again the focus was on the relationship between poverty, inequality and health, and in particular child health. (Read the APPG’s earlier report <a href="https://www.fph.org.uk/media/1374/appg-health-in-all-policies-inquiry-into-child-poverty-and-health2.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.)</p>
<p>Five years on, we have conducted a follow-up review of the actual impacts of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016.</p>
<p>There is a growing evidence base of the direct and negative impacts of different aspects of the social security system on the mental and physical health of claimants and their families, in addition to the indirect impacts mediated by poverty as a result of having inadequate income from work and/or social security support.</p>
<p>In addition to quantitative evidence we looked at qualitative studies which pointed to a process of ‘dehumanising’ claimants that eroded their self-esteem and confidence, making them feel worthless. In some cases, the whole experience had proved too much for some claimants and they have taken their own lives.</p>
<p>It’s important to note the knock-on impact that this ill health will have on health services and for social protection to be recognised as mitigating against socio-economic health risk factors.</p>
<p>Although the Government achieved their aim of cutting welfare spending by introducing these measures – working age spending on social security has shrunk by £34bn since 2010 – there has been minimal impact on helping to get people into work who wouldn’t have got into work without these measures.”</p>
<p><a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf">The full report</a> was launched with a panel of speakers to discuss the findings and recommendations of the report including:</p>
<p>Professor Clare Bambra, University of Newcastle</p>
<p>Helen Barnard, Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p>
<p>Ellen Clifford, Disabled People Against Cuts</p>
<p>Professor David Taylor Robinson, University of Liverpool</p>
<p>Geoff Fimister, Disability Benefits Consortium</p>
<p>‘Aurora’ (not her real name) – a widowed parent of two children</p>
<p><strong>‘Aurora’</strong> said: “Our situation has been greatly impacted by the changes to the benefits system. We can no longer afford the essentials to ensure even a basic standard of living. After rent and deductions are paid there is nothing left. I do not feel supported by the DWP, and I feel our group have been ignored. The pandemic highlights a desperate requirement for reform.</p>
<p>“We need help to participate and become productive members of society. It is our children who invariably suffer, poverty has lasting effects, they bare the consequences of these policies.”</p>
<p><strong>Helen Barnard, JRF Director</strong>, said: “In the last year, millions more people have turned to social security to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The importance of a strong social security system to act as an anchor for all of us, preventing us being swept into poverty by unexpected events, illness or job loss has never been clearer.  This APPG report demonstrates starkly the damage done to individuals, families and communities by weakening social security.</p>
<p>As we look forward to the easing of the public health emergency, we must learn the lessons of the pandemic and of previous recessions and ensure that social security is strengthened. There is a long way to go before the economic storm passes; the government must live up to the promise of bringing us through that storm safely, starting by keeping the £20 uplift to Universal Credit and extending it to those on legacy benefits who have been unjustly excluded from additional support so far.</p>
<p><strong>Professor David Taylor-Robinson, University of Liverpool</strong>, said: “Even before covid-19, extremely disturbing trends in health were emerging in England. Growing child poverty, homelessness, and food poverty led to an unprecedented rise in infant mortality, mental health problems, and stalling life expectancy, especially for women in the poorest areas and cities. These were the same areas where 10 years of austerity measures had hit the poorest groups the hardest.</p>
<p>“The APPG report shows how reductions in social security for families with children have hit the most vulnerable communities. In addition larger cuts in government funding to local authorities with higher proportions of children in poverty have meant a reduction in spending on vital preventive services in areas where they were needed most.</p>
<p>“We know that rising child poverty has myriad adverse impacts on multiple aspects of child health and development that will have repercussions for decades to come. It is time for the government to reverse these extremely concerning trends, establishing a welfare system that protects children from poverty and material deprivation.”</p>
<p><strong>Geoff Fimister, Policy Co-Chair, Disability Benefits Consortium</strong>, said: “As the economic fallout from the Covid crisis threatens to make life even tougher for disabled people, in or out of work – and as the Chancellor prepares his Budget and the Government proposes to announce details of its disability strategy later this year – this important report could hardly be more timely. It sets out clearly the impacts of austerity on disabled people and the measures needed to set a new direction and start to put things right.</p>
<p>The Disability Benefits Consortium is a network of more than 100 organisations concerned with achieving real social security for disabled people. We gave evidence to this inquiry – based on our research and on feedback from our members – and are very pleased to see such clear and well-founded analysis and  recommendations. We hope that the Government will take notice.”</p>
<p><strong>Professor Clare Bambra of Newcastle University</strong> commented: “Our results show the importance to protecting people’s mental health of adequate social safety nets. This is particularly relevant now as the lock down and the COVID-19 pandemic is already leading to deteriorations in people’s mental health. Our research suggests that the current increase to Universal Credit of £20 per week should be maintained in order to protect the mental health of the most vulnerable in our society.”</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Clifford, </strong><strong>Disabled People Against Cuts</strong>, said: “I very much welcome the report launched today. Since 2010, extensive work has been undertaken by Disabled People’s Organisations, charities, academics and journalists to investigate, document and research the disproportionate impacts of welfare reform measures on those with the lowest incomes in society including disabled people. Interrogating and reflecting upon that wide evidence-base, the APPG has produced a stark report that succeeds in cutting through the spin and selective use of figures to present a hard-hitting portrait of Britain today. We are the sixth richest country in the world and yet infant mortality is rising and life expectancy declining. The Resolution Foundation calculated that by 2022, the total annual savings in spending for working age social security claimants from 2010 would be £34billion.</p>
<p>“In December 2020, the Marmot Review and analysis into the UK’s “high and unequal” Covid-19 death toll exposed key causes of this as existing poverty and inequalities driven by 10 years of austerity including social security cuts. Even after the £20 per week Universal Credit uplift, benefit claimants are receiving just 43.4% of the minimum income standard (MIS), which is the amount required for an acceptable standard of living. For those still on legacy benefits who have never been granted an uplift, their incomes are just 33.9% of the MIS. Many of these are disabled people, many have been shielding for over a year now and have seen their expenditures rise sharply as a result. The Disability Benefits Consortium recently published findings showing that 66% of disabled people on legacy benefits surveyed are having to choose between eating or heating.</p>
<p>“The news that the Universal credit uplift is set to continue for a further six months is welcome, but we need to urgently pressure the government into extending the uplift to legacy benefits. There is no question that the failure to do so has been detrimental to disabled people’s health and I echo the report recommendation calling for research into the long-term health effects of different social security levels to be carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions in conjunction with the Department for Health and Social Care. Ultimately what we need is a new social security system, one that provides a genuine safety net for all and that guarantees a decent standard of living. Only then will we begin to see a reversal of the regressive health and inequality trends of the past decade.”</p>

	&lt;p&gt;The vaccination programme is expanding across South West London and there are now over 238,000 vaccines across 40 vaccination centres, including 25 GP led centres, 8 hospital hubs, 4 pharmacy-led services and 3 large vaccination centres. With over 70% of vaccines delivered at primary care sites GPs have been leading the way in vaccinating local people to make sure vaccines are offered to all over 70s and front-line health and care staff by Monday 15 February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone aged 70 and over who hasn’t  yet had an invitation for a vaccination is being asked to come forward and contact the NHS to book a jab through the national booking service&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/5Bo9CMw3pC82rVDIkA4pC?domain=nhs.uk"&gt;www.nhs.uk/covid-vaccination&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 119 free of charge between 7am and 11pm seven days a week. The national booking service allows people to book an appointment at their nearest large vaccination centre or pharmacy service. If a suitable and convenient slot is not available people can also call their GP practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQs about the vaccine and booking an appointment from NHS South West London Clinical Commissioning Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am confused about my second dose of the vaccine. Can you explain this to me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both vaccines have been authorised on the basis of two doses because the evidence from the clinical trials shows that this gives the maximum level of protection.  To ensure as many people are vaccinated as quickly as possible, the Department for Health and Social Care now advise that the second dose of both the Oxford/AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine should be scheduled up to 12 weeks apart.  The evidence doesn’t show any risk to not having the second dose other than not being as protected as you otherwise would be.  Please be reassured that there are no safety concerns in the new guidance, and it will not impact on how effective the vaccination is in protecting you from Covid-19 once the course is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to do anything to arrange your second dose. The NHS will contact you with your appointment details. Wait to be contacted. The second dose completes the course and is likely to be important for longer-term protection. It&amp;#8217;s important to get both doses to protect yourself against coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have a second appointment booked already and you should have a record card with details of your next appointment written on it, this will be around 12 weeks after your first appointment and at the same location where you received your first dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if I am over 70 and haven’t been contacted by my GP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now the NHS has asked people to wait until they are contacted to help ensure that those who are most vulnerable are protected first- and that remains the case for most people. However, whilst we have now vaccinated well over 84% of over 70s, to ensure absolutely everyone is offered the vaccine, people aged 70 and over can now contact the NHS so they can be vaccinated by the middle of this month. The easiest way to arrange a vaccination is through the national booking services which can be accessed at &lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/NJuaCNL3qixZW5JFjbh0z?domain=nhs"&gt;www.nhs.uk/covid-vaccination.&lt;/a&gt; If you are unable to book online can call 119 free of charge, anytime between 7am and 11pm seven days a week. The national booking service allows people to arrange a vaccination at their nearest vaccination centre or pharmacy service. If a suitable and convenient slot is not available people can also call their GP practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the COVID-19 vaccines safe for people with long term conditions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines will be approved if it is considered safe for people with long-term conditions.  These vaccines are safe and effective for the vast majority of people – they have been tested on tens of thousands of people and assessed by experts. Your GP can advise on when you are eligible and will contact you with an appointment when it’s your turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very small number of people who are at risk of COVID-19 cannot have the vaccine – this includes people who have severe allergies. Everybody will also be screened for potential allergic reactions before getting vaccinated. All vaccinators will have the training they need to deal with any rare cases of adverse reactions, and all venues will be equipped to care for people who need it – just like with any other vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA have updated their guidance to say that pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding can have the vaccine but should discuss it with a clinician to ensure that the benefits outweigh any potential risks. Women of childbearing age, those who are pregnant, or breastfeeding should read the &lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/JXEECP73vFm0wA9t6dSaW?domain=nhs.uk/"&gt;detailed information available on NHS.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I need to do before I get my vaccine?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS will contact you and invite you to book a vaccine appointment when it’s your turn. You may receive a phone call, letter or text message from your GP practice or a letter from the national booking service, so it’s useful to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep an eye out to make sure you receive the message (for example if you have a mobile phone but don’t typically use text messages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let your GP surgery know if you are caring for someone with underlying health conditions who would struggle to cope if you became unwell. You can help the vaccination effort by emailing your GP practice or using its website to make sure your local surgery knows you are an unpaid carer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update your contact details if they have changed lately – it’s a good time to make sure your GP practice has the most up to date information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you’re registered with a GP and have up to date contact details you should receive an invitation in due course. For more information how to register with a GP and to find your local surgery visit: &lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/JmNNCRO3xslG6PoHQhY3c?domain=nhs.uk"&gt;www.nhs.uk/register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out about what to expect at your vaccine appointment please visit: &lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/0Ej7CVA3BFK2JjmfEopLi?domain=nhs.uk/"&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/what-happens-at-your-appointment/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are teachers eligible to receive a vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS is currently only offering vaccines to people within England&amp;#8217;s first four priority groups, in line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidelines. This does not include teachers, unless they also meet age or health-related criteria. Vaccinating the priority groups first will save the most lives and provide the quickest and safest route out of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hatfield based company helps roll out 1 million devices to disadvantaged children as 8,860 make their way to Hertfordshire</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><strong>Hertfordshire has now received 8,860 laptops and tablets to help support disadvantaged children and young people while they learn at home. More than 1 million devices have now been delivered with more on their way.</strong></p>



<p>MP for Welwyn Hatfield Grant Shapps has welcomed the announcement that pupils across Hertfordshire have benefited from 8,860 laptops and tablets to date, as the government hits an important milestone in its rollout of devices to support disadvantaged students.</p>



<p>Hatfield based company Computacenter has been a key part of the £400 million Department of Education scheme, as well as assisting the Computers for Kids initiative.</p>



<p>The Department announced last month a further 300,000 laptops and tablets to help even more disadvantaged children and young people learn at home.</p>



<p>In addition, the government is partnering with the UK’s leading mobile network operators to provide free data to disadvantaged families, alongside a further £300 million being invested in tutoring programmes building on the existing £1 billion Covid Catch Up Fund.</p>



<p>Commenting, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “No child should miss out as a result of the disruption caused by this pandemic. It’s been our priority to equip the children in most need with the tools they need to get on with their learning.</p>



<p>“It’s great to see that so many electronic devices have been delivered across the country. It’s also brilliant to see a company based here in Welwyn Hatfield take a leading role in supplying these devices.</p>



<p>“Of course, whilst we hope that our children will be back learning in school as soon as possible, we will do everything in our power to give them the world-class education they deserve as they learn at home.</p>



<p>Over 1 million laptops and tablets delivered, with 8,860 to Hertfordshire kids alone, will go a long way in helping us deliver this.”</p>



<p>Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “I know what a challenging period this has been for pupils, teachers and parents – but it has been nothing short of inspiring to see schools and staff going above and beyond, as they always have done, to give our pupils the very best education possible.”</p>



<p>“I want parents to know that we’ll continue to do everything we can to protect our children’s education at this unprecedented time and ensure they have the tools they need to get on with and make the most of their lives”.</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

    <title>How to write a script for an e-course</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>Welcoming the Fantastic Ryanair Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianpaisleymp.co.uk/2016/01/11/welcoming-the-fantastic-ryanair-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br/>
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br/>
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br/>
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br/>
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br/>
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br/>
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br/>
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br/>
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
