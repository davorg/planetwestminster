              <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 6 September Jon Cruddas MP was contacted by the government with details of a new Covid-19 Test Centre in Dagenham which opened on the same day. <strong>The new test centre is located at the Ballard Road Car Park, The Leys, RM10 9TP and will be a ‘walk-through’ local test site.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The new site will make it easier for people to access a test on foot or by cycle from the local area and is aimed at complementing the existing network of drive-through testing facilities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Before selecting the site, the government liaised with both the local authority and public health stakeholders in order to ensure that the site was suitable for the service.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Across the UK testing capacity is currently at 720,000 per day. Anyone experiencing a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste – should book a test a nhs.uk/coronavirus, by calling 119, using the NHS Covid-19 app or by attending a walk-in site such as the new one in Dagenham.</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has tabled an Early Day Motion to recognise the recent Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’S (PHSO) report into State Pension Age communications.</p>
<p>Gwynne, who is Co-Chair of the All-party parliamentary group for State Pension Inequality for Women alongside Conservative MP Peter Aldous, has tabled the motion to put pressure on the Department for Work and Pensions to act in addressing the ongoing 1950s-born women pension injustice.</p>
<p>An Early Day Motion is a non-binding motion which is open for MPs to sign during the parliamentary session. Traditionally, EDM’s have been used by MPs to raise awareness of a particular topic, and to indicate cross-party support for an issue.</p>
<p>Gwynne’s EDM highlights the recent findings of the PHSO who are in the process of investigating the Department for Work and Pensions. The PHSO found that successive DWP administrations had committed maladministration in inadequately communicating changes to State Pension Age for 1950s-born women.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the motion, Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<p>“I’m pleased that this motion has been published and is garnering cross-party support. An early day motion in itself will not force the Government to act, but it will allow Parliamentarians to express their frustration at the lack of action from the DWP.</p>
<p>This is part of the continuing work that the APPG is doing; namely, to continue to raise this issue and draw attention to it by any parliamentary means. We hope to utlise parliamentary procedure to bring this issue to the floor of the House, and will continue to update 1950s-born women accordingly. They are doing a fantastic job of campaigning for justice outside of Parliament, and parliamentarians must now start matching their efforts.</p>
<p>My message to the Government is simple. Meet with 1950s-women, APPG members and policymakers. Let’s sort this problem out once and for all.”</p>

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the House of Commons last night, South Lakes MP Tim Farron urged the Vaccines Minister to publish guidance which will stop care home managers having to make thousands of workers redundant next week.</p>
<p>From November 11<sup>th</sup>, care home workers who have not received both doses of the covid-19 vaccine will no longer be allowed to work in the sector - giving them just nine days to get their first jab.</p>
<p>Care homes have been a promised an exemption list for staff who can't receive a vaccine for medical or religious reasons, but the Government are still yet to publish it.</p>
<p>It comes as the largest survey of home care providers ever conducted found the sector is facing its worst staffing crisis in history, with thousands of vulnerable people going without care as a result.</p>
<p>Some 78% of providers who responded to the survey commissioned by UK Homecare Association, said recruiting carers is the hardest it has ever been, with many describe themselves as being at "breaking point".</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament yesterday, Tim said: <em>"The effective cut-off for care home staff to get their first jab in order to comply with the Government's deadline is just 10 days away, and those who are not double-jabbed in time will not be able to work in care homes.</em></p>
<p><em>"However, there has yet to be any unequivocal guidance on who will be exempt from this, and care home managers in my constituency are desperately concerned, especially in the light of the most unprecedented care home staffing crisis in a generation. They are desperate for that guidance. Will the Minister provide it today?"</em></p>
<p>In response, the Minister for Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said: <em>"The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: 11 November is the date by which care homes and care home providers will have to comply with the legislation on the vaccination programme.</em></p>
<p><em>"I would be happy to share with him the guidance and the communication that we have sent out to the sector, and I will write to him after this statement."</em></p>

<p>Millions of people across the UK, including many in Llanelli,
may be excluded from their democratic right to vote under plans put forward
today by the Conservative UK Government, according to local MP, Nia Griffith.</p>



<p>In the recent Queen’s Speech, the Government formally
announced their plans to introduce mandatory Voter ID at the next election.
This policy requires voters to present photo ID to vote at polling stations in
future general elections. </p>



<p>NIA GRIFFITH, MP for Llanelli, said: </p>



<p>“Voting is safe and secure in Britain. Ministers should
be promoting confidence in our elections instead of spreading baseless scare
stories. </p>



<p>Millions of people lack photo ID in this country
including many here in Llanelli – in particular the elderly, low income and
Black, Asian and ethnic minority voters. 7.5% of the electorate – don’t have
access to any photo ID at all, so will be excluded from voting if the Tories go
through with this. </p>



<p>Driving licenses and passports cost money – something
that many people don’t have. In addition, young voters are far less likely to
carry a form of photo ID, threatening to silence their voices in our democracy.”</p>



<p>The MP, who will be voting against the proposals later
today in the House of Commons, added:</p>



<p>“It doesn’t matter how the government dresses it up,
these plans make it harder for working class, young and ethnic minority people
to vote. It’s simply undemocratic and wrong and that the Government are
attempting to supress voters. </p>



<p>Voter fraud is a vanishingly rare offence in the UK. In
2019, out of 59 million votes cast in elections, there was just one conviction
for voter impersonation – the type of fraud that Voter ID is support to tackle.
You are more likely to get struck by lightning twice than commit voter fraud. </p>



<p>These plans are also shockingly expensive, forecast to
cost at least £17 million per general election – money that can be spent far
better elsewhere.” </p>

    <title>Do we fight too many wars</title>

<p><strong> 457 members of the UK military  were killed in Afghanistan this century. We have to ask Why did they die?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>War is a continuation of diplomacy and politics by violent means. A decent nation only fights a war when talking has failed, when the cause is just and when force is the only language the wrong doers understand. Success lies in fighting fewer wars.  Having well resourced and respected armed services is a vital part of our nation’s security and diplomatic weight. Because we have fought victoriously in the past and show resolve in the present we have more chance of negotiating and preserving the peace. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Falklands war is a perfect example of how a successful war is sometimes necessary and can right an obvious wrong. The unwarranted and illegal invasion of the islands against the wishes of practically every Falkland islander had to be reversed. International diplomacy failed. The Argentinians were unwilling to listen to peace proposals that required they respect the right and wish to the islanders to enjoy self government. A dangerous military campaign was brilliantly executed by UK forces. Peace was re established as soon as the last Argentinians surrendered and has endured ever since. The 258 UK deaths were not in vain. The nation took pride in their achievements. The world is a better place for us showing once again that violent annexation of a country and the termination of its freedoms is unacceptable conduct which will be reversed. We had to do it on our own, as there were  divided views amongst nations despite the abuse of force by Argentina.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>383,000 of our military lost their lives in the second world war. The vast scale of the death and destruction acts as a warning to the generations that  follow to give diplomacy and politics every chance of success in disputes between the great powers. Today technology has delivered even more terrifying abilities to armed forces to kill huge numbers of people and destroy whole cities, making sensible politicians of the  best armed countries even more reluctant to resort to war with each other. The nation as a whole does think those who lost their lives between 1939 and 1945 did so for a just cause with an eventual good result. Individual deaths may have resulted from poor planning or bad decisions by the command. More may have died owing to  bad intelligence, inadequate force or even friendly fire. The pressures of total war and the ruthless ingenuity of the enemy set each of those difficult deaths into a wider and more understandable  context. There is virtual unanimity that there was no feasible negotiated peace available in 1939 that would have prevented the violent annexation of Europe  by Germany or would have prevented the genocides which followed. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The relatives and friends of the 457 fallen in Afghanistan need to be reassured that our nation is proud of them too. The immediate cause of NATO’s Afghan war was the unprovoked and shocking attack of terrorists on the United States, with mass civilian casualties. The USA had good intelligence that Afghanistan harboured evil men  and the Afghan government was unable to offer assurances that it would find and prosecute the guilty. The early NATO campaign was successful and the government was overthrown. NATO then sought to support the creation of a government for the country chosen in free elections and capable of giving a better life to the many. Economic recovery and better treatment of women and girls followed. As a result many Afghans enjoyed an improved  life over the last two decades. The deaths of our troops made that possible. Their achievements should not be forgotten.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The issue for NATO and the politicians is why did the politics fail this year? War is a means to a better end. It is the means to rebase politics which have gone wrong, and to change personnel where government has fallen into evil hands. It is a way of overthrowing dictatorial constitutions and tyrants. This was done in Afghanistan. Unfortunately the decision  of President Biden to remove US forces late one night without proper consultation let alone agreement from the Afghan government and allies led to the rapid collapse of democratic government in Afghanistan.The sad scenes of a scrambled exit for the rest of the allies and friends of  NATO  at Kabul airport led on to triumphant displays of Afghan gunmen showing off captured NATO uniforms and weapons. The return of the Taliban leaves the USA weakened and the NATO allies visibly sidelined. It plunges many in Afghanistan into despair. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Until the withdrawal in recent years NATO had been able to offer limited support and advice to the security forces of the Afghan state, and to keep its own military personnel in the country largely out of harms way. It was a relatively cheap way of defending democracy and basic freedoms in a troubled part of the world and was only undertaken because the elected government wanted NATO to help them keep order.  What followed a botched exit by the President was a needless disaster of his own  making. None of this should detract from the bravery and good intentions of our forces in the twenty years of supporting the elected Afghan government. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Since 1945 the UK has been involved in a lot of more  limited wars. In each case we need to ask why did we use lethal force against others and why did UK service personnel die? We might conclude that we have intervened too often. We should certainly conclude that there have been some bad political and diplomatic failures. War should only be a last resort and should only be used where there does need to be a decisive change which cannot be achieved by talking. There is plenty of collateral damage from warfare. That is elite talk for more people losing their lives and more property and livelihoods being demolished as others disagree violently. We need to get better at talking and persuading, if needs be with realistic threats that we would rather not carry out. People need to know we can and will use force as a last resort as we seek to show them that there are better ways for them as well as us. </strong></p>

<p>On Friday, I had great chats with Cllr Andrew Jamieson (Cabinet Member for Finance) and Paul Cracknell (Executive Director of Strategy and Transformation) at Norfolk County Council – learning more about their portfolios and discussing what work they were doing with councilors and officers to support and improve the lives of people across the county.</p>

<p>Those conversations followed the regular MP briefing that NCC Leader, Cllr Andrew Proctor, holds for my fellow parliamentary colleagues and I – and, in addition to working closely with a number of our excellent local councilors on a variety of Mid Norfolk issues, I have also had positive catch ups with Cllr John Fuller (Leader of South Norfolk Council) and Cllr Sam Chapman-Allen (Leader of Breckland Council) in recent days.</p>

<p>THANK YOU to all those in elected office in Norfolk, as well as all of the council officers and support staff. You do so much for our wonderful county and we are truly lucky to have you.</p></div>

<p>I recently stumbled upon a fascinating radio piece with Prince Charles and the Poet Laureate, Simon Armitage.</p>



<p>They were discussing vegetables, plants and nature. I was interested because earlier the same day I&#8217;d visited Greenaleigh Community Gardens to witness the wonderful progress they&#8217;ve made.</p>



<p>The programme reminded me about many things people raised on the Greenaleigh visit: helping children understand nature; involving the community; making best use of land to grow food and help others.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also recently been to the Food Pantry at Yardley Wood, Baptist Church and the Community Café, supported by the Active Well Being Society, in Druids Heath. These visits got me thinking about some issues associated with food and the environment.</p>



<p>Our whole approach has changed since the end of rationing in 1954 when ironically the diet of the entire nation is believed to have been at its most healthy. During and immediately after the war, allotments were in great demand because access to affordable, fresh food was associated with survival. Since then, we&#8217;ve become a throwaway society.</p>



<p>Availability of good food and better health must be part of the COP26 agenda.</p>



<p>Projects like the Community Gardens offer a chance for the young to mix with and learn from older members of the community about food, avoiding waste, simple cooking techniques, growing vegetables and tackling the throwaway culture.</p>



<p>I understand the passion people feel about climate change. I confess I&#8217;m more comfortable with youngsters learning through allotments and craftivism than strikes, breaking windows or disruption of public transport. Protest has its place but so do ventures like Greenaleigh, the Community Café or Food Pantry.</p>



<p>Environmental issues are interrelated. I want COP26 to be successful. I hope, in all the campaigning, there can be a place for positive local initiatives which make a difference.</p>

<p>The £28 million project has now reconnected Lewis and Harris to the mainland electricity network.</p>



<p>For the last 10 months, Lewis and Harris have been relying entirely on the Power Stations in Stornoway and local wind farms have been unable to export energy.</p>



<p>Angus MacNeil MP said: “I would like to commend the SSEN teams for completing this large-scale, complex project on time and ensuring that the islands are reconnected to the mainland electricity network.</p>



<p>“I would also like to commend the teams at Battery Point and Arnish Power Stations which have been at full-duty operation to maintain a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to keep our island homes and businesses connected.</p>



<p>“I am also pleased to hear that plans are moving forward on strategic subsea investment projects in the islands including an upgrade to the circuit between Skye and Uist, and also the proposed 600MW HVDC transmission link to the islands.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Prime Minister laid out his vision of a Green Industrial Revolution last year, and shortly thereafter published an Energy White Paper to set the framework for the next critical phase of renewable energy rollout. But there remain several detailed strategies of how to get there still awaiting publication, now expected in coming weeks, as part of the preparation for COP26. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last month the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released their latest report, making clear the impact of human activity on global temperatures, and the vital need to take action to avoid a climate catastrophe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee, I have been vocal in saying the government needs to meet rhetoric with action. The private sector, galvanised by a mix of greater awareness of environmental issues by senior management and the realisation customers expect companies to play a role in combatting climate change, is ready and willing to invest. But government needs to set a clear direction, to drive investment into net zero technologies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, industry’s confidence has taken several knocks by delayed strategies and some cancellation of policies. The Green Homes Grant voucher scheme for owner occupiers to make energy efficiency improvements for their homes, since cancelled, was overly bureaucratic, and proved difficult to access for both building contractors and homeowners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notwithstanding this, to its credit the government has outlined significant ambition on net zero. But there are deep rooted challenges. There remains a shortage of skills in green engineering disciplines, the green automotive sector and qualified installers for energy efficiency measures like heat pumps or insulation retrofits. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Environmental Audit Committee has undertaken a number of inquiries to help inform debate around achieving Net Zero Britain, and to provide recommendations to government on how to focus policy. Homes account for 20% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, but there is significant underestimation in government of the cost of addressing this, and we are still awaiting a Heat &amp; Buildings Strategy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support the move to electric vehicles, we must invest in Gigafactory capacity for battery production and EV charging capacity, as other countries have. There have been some encouraging announcements on investment in battery plants recently. But grid connection and regulatory issues continue to hold back community energy schemes, as well as tidal power and further progress in our offshore wind sector – which has proven a real UK success story. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, COP26 is an international conference, and fostering international commitments to combat climate change must be the focus. The UK has made admirable progress in cutting our emissions while growing the economy. So we are well placed to demonstrate to developing nations that combatting climate change does not mean curtailing growth or improving living standards for their citizens. The UK government must seek to be a benchmark to inspire others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have been promoting community engagement in COP26, including through presenting the COP26 President, Alok Sharma MP, with a community action plan from South Shropshire Climate Action. I have encouraged local schools to give pupils the opportunity to learn more about COP26 and the issues it is seeking to address. Next month I am hoping to arrange screening locally an educational film on the environment for young people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is going to be a major topic for coming months, so if you are interested in learning more about COP26, please visit &lt;a href="https://ukcop26.org"&gt;https://ukcop26.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

<p>On Thursday 19<sup>th</sup>August 2021, John took the opportunity to visit local fundraiser Paul Hobbs who was walking a full marathon (26.2 miles) around the Grand Pier in Weston. During the walk, Paul explained to John that fundraising for the British Heart Foundation was hugely important to him as exactly two years ago he underwent life saving heart surgery. </p>



<p>Paul is in his 26th year of fundraising and after walking a few laps with Paul, John spoke to his team of supporters who were documenting the event and expressed his admiration for everything Paul had done over the years. He added that people should take inspiration from Paul, seeing as just 2 years ago he was having lifesaving surgery and now at 72 years old he is back fit and walking a marathon along Weston&#8217;s Pier.</p>

    <title>Judith to continue to work with Morrisons and USDAW for best outcome for staff and Bradford.</title>

&lt;p&gt;“I know that discussions between Morrisons, their staff and USDAW the trade union that represents so many of the workers are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is my view that these discussions with the workforce through USDAW should continue to enable the very best outcome for workers in Morrisons. Workers need reassurances regarding the future of their jobs and their terms and conditions including their pensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture says it all &amp;#8211; my respect can not really be put into words for our national heroes. I feel humbled by seeing this image.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 14 August 2021, our brave Armed Forces have evacuated over 15,000 British nationals and vulnerable Afghans through Operation PITTING.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;16 Air Assault Brigade, the Army&amp;#8217;s airborne rapid reaction force, is now returning home to the UK.&lt;br&gt;I want to say a massive thank for their hard work to save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humanitarian aid will be vital to save and protect lives in Afghanistan</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Even before the withdrawal of US troops, Afghanistan was facing a humanitarian crisis with 18.4 million people dependent on support for health care, education, clean water, and employment. </p>
<p>It was, and remains, one of the poorest countries in the world with half of all Afghans living in poverty. </p>
<p>3.7 million children were out-of-school - 60% of whom were girls and an estimated 2.9 million Afghans are internally displaced, and over 2 million refugees are being hosted by Pakistan and Iran. </p>
<p>This year alone, a further half a million people have left their homes and the risks to women and girls has grown as the Taliban have taken control of the country. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Keir Starmer, stood in front of the Despatch Box and gave a moving and powerful speech highlighting the complacency and incompetency of the Prime Minister and his Foreign and Development Secretary. He rightly raised the failure of Government which had 18 months to plan and prepare for the consequences of the US withdrawing their troops. That failure has let down the Afghan people and the UK nationals who worked with them.</p>
<p>We should be incredibly proud of the brave British men and women who served in our armed forces and those working for INGOs. Their contribution has made Afghanistan safer, more secure and provided opportunities for the Afghan people.</p>
<p>In any conversation you have with someone who has been in Afghanistan, they will tell you that none of their work would have been possible without those who worked alongside British nationals to build a country that they could live and thrive in.</p>
<p>As the evacuation of British nationals continues, these people, who are at risk of being targeted by the Taliban, are being betrayed by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>My colleagues, Nick Thomas Symonds and John Healey have been working tirelessly to highlight the Conservative Government’s incompetence in failing to plan for the safe evacuation of those we have worked with ahead of the withdrawal. This has left huge numbers of Afghans’ lives in danger and we must immediately respond to the scale of the challenge facing us.</p>
<p>For those remaining in Afghanistan it is clear that humanitarian support will be vital to save and protect lives but the Government’s position on this has been incredibly confusing; from threatening to withhold aid on Monday, to a commitment to increase it by 10% on Tuesday, to return it to just under 2019 levels on Wednesday. </p>
<p>It is welcome that the Government have u-turned on their initial position as the cuts to aid programmes in Afghanistan were callous, short sighted and costing lives. </p>
<p>Many were tackling important issues like child trafficking, demining, women’s social and economic empowerment. It was morally reprehensible that they had been cut. </p>
<p>Labour are clear that with the Taliban now running the country the risk to women and girls, is real and requires an urgent humanitarian response with clear timeline and priorities including:</p>
<p>1) Immediate action to ensure safe passage and evacuation for those who are at risk including women rights activists, journalists and politicians.</p>
<p>2) Leading efforts to work with countries neighbouring Afghanistan to ensure vital safeguarding and support is in place for Afghan refugees who have fled to those countries and to keep borders open for humanitarian assistance into the country</p>
<p>3) Providing urgent detail on how the government will deploy the increased aid the Prime Minister committed to and how the UK will work with trusted partners who are already embedded in the country to resume services as soon as it is safe to do so to deliver vital support to those who need it most.</p>
<p>4) Using our position as president of the G7 and on the UN Security Council and working with our allies to ensure a coordinated and global humanitarian response which safeguards Afghan women and girls and protects the human rights of the people of Afghanistan as well as guaranteeing the safety of humanitarian workers and diplomats remaining in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The best of Britain is a country that stands up for our fellow human beings and keeps the promises we make but that hard won reputation has been decimated on the global stage.</p>
<p>After so many catastrophic failures of judgement, the Prime Minister cannot allow the Foreign and Development Secretary to continue in his role and must now focus on using every tool that remains at his disposal to ensure no one is left behind.</p>

    <title>LETTER: Cross Party MPs call for action to protect Afghan Nationals</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/letter-cross-party-mps-call-for-action-to-protect-afghan-nationals/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=letter-cross-party-mps-call-for-action-to-protect-afghan-nationals" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A cross-party group of Members of Parliament have written to the Home Secretary asking for urgent action to protect Afghan nationals. The full letter and signatories below:</p>
<p><strong>SENT VIA EMAIL </strong>to Rt Hon Priti Patel MP, Secretary of State for the Home Department</p>
<p>19 August 2021</p>
<p><strong>Re: Securing adequate protection for Afghan nationals</strong></p>
<p>Dear Home Secretary,</p>
<p>The whole country has watched in horror the fall of Afghanistan to Taliban forces. The eyes of the world will now be watching how countries with a proud history of welcoming refugees respond, and particularly how they treat people forced to flee. Reports confirm that extrajudicial killings have already begun. Those in particular danger include women and girls, ethnic minorities, LGBTIQ+ people and journalists. In addition, anyone seen to be supportive of the Afghan government or of international organisations is at risk of being targeted.</p>
<p>People currently at risk from the Taliban need to flee immediately and by whatever means necessary. For many, this will be via irregular journeys. A large-scale international resettlement effort is desperately needed to evacuate people from the country and the surrounding region. However, the deadly scramble for safety at Kabul Airport in recent days demonstrates why a resettlement-only approach to refugee protection, as proposed in the Nationality and Borders Bill currently before Parliament, cannot work.</p>
<p>As a matter of urgency, the Government must establish sustainable solutions for those who will seek our protection over the coming weeks and months, as well as Afghans already living in the UK, their families and loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>To achieve this, the Government must urgently take the following steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure no Afghan national faces removal to any third country under the inadmissibility rules, regardless of how they have travelled to seek protection in the UK. These individuals should instead be offered immediate and sustainable protection</li>
<li>Introduce a simplified process to grant immediate protection to some 3000 Afghan nationals currently awaiting a decision on their asylum application and facilitate an expedited application process for those submitting a fresh or new claim going forwards.</li>
<li>Ensure no Afghan national is evicted from asylum accommodation while this procedure is being established.</li>
<li>Expedite family reunification applications for people from Afghanistan and widen the criteria to include parents and siblings of applicants. Normal procedures requiring applications to take place through embassies must similarly be suspended.</li>
<li>Immediately release all Afghan nationals currently held in immigration removal centres, given the impossibility of safely effecting removals.</li>
<li>Review and broaden Afghan Locally Employed Staff Relocation schemes to protect people working in all at-risk professions, for instance drivers and security staff who have worked with the UK.</li>
<li>Immediately publish new policy guidance reflecting the need for humanitarian protection, and the danger faced by numerous social groups including women and girls, LGBTIQ+ people, men and boys targeted by the Taliban, ethnic and religious minorities, and human rights defenders throughout the country, including Kabul.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as presenting an urgent protection challenge, this situation also calls into question the Government’s current approach to refugee protection in general. When people are forced to flee in the middle of the night, there is no queue they can join for resettlement. People whose lives are at risk will be forced to flee by whatever means are available to them, including irregular means.</p>
<p>In light of this crisis, we urge the Government to drop its current inadmissibility rules, and its decision to criminalise refugee journeys that are not undertaken through regulated resettlement routes. Refugees reaching our shores must have their claims assessed based solely on need and never on their method of flight. The provisions in the Nationality and Borders Bill currently before Parliament that would criminalise refugees based on their mode of travel, and introduce a two-tier system of refugee protection, must be withdrawn.</p>
<p>It is within the Government’s gift to mount a world-leading, compassionate response to this crisis. We hereby call on the Government and the Ministers responsible to act urgently to deliver the compassionate response that is so sorely needed.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Many constituents have contacted me about the appalling and deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, after the Taliban took control of the capital city of Kabul on Sunday, August 15.</p>
<p>I share your profound concern and distress about the impact this will have on the lives of Afghan people, particularly women and those who have been working alongside NATO forces, NGOs and many others.</p>
<p>I was in the Chamber today to speak not only as the vice-Chair of the Afghanistan APPG, but also on behalf of my co-worker and dear friend Marzia Babakarkhail. Like so many others, Marzia had to flee her home in Afghanistan after the Taliban tried to assassinate her. You can watch my speech in full <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/392a628b-beda-4bc1-91df-584f2a1cdf90?in=13:37:34">here.</a></p>
<p>The present situation on-ground in Afghanistan is shocking and worsening by the hour. The withdrawal of international forces in the country, especially those of the U.S, has lead to the inevitable fall of the Afghani Government, just two weeks before the U.S. was due to complete its troop withdrawal. I remain extremely concerned about the speed with which the insurgents stormed across the country, capturing all major cities in a matter of days.</p>
<p>We now face the tragic rollback of the gains that UK soldiers, diplomats and NGO workers, and their coalition and Afghan partners made over the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Women and girls will lose the freedoms they gained and those speaking out face real threats to their lives alongside members of the LGBT+ community and religious minorities who were viciously targeted under Taliban rule and now face extermination. This is in part due to the catastrophic miscalculation of the capacity and legitimacy of the Afghan government, and the resilience of Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the U.S. and its allies. That the international community has been caught out in this way is quite shocking and speaks volumes about our priorities and the lack of a human rights focus in our foreign policies.</p>
<p>The international community’s response including the UK’s has been absolutely woeful and far too slow considering the immense danger so many are in as the situation is so fast-changing. This is a shameful dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>The immediate focus must be for the government to accelerate efforts to get UK nationals, support staff and the thousands of Afghans nationals who have served and worked alongside coalition forces out of the country. As well as the women activists who are now in grave danger of Taliban reprisals, many of whom have already faced threats. We have already seen reports of Taliban hit squads hunt down those they see as “collaborating” with coalition forces.</p>
<p>We should help lead that effort by committing to a British Afghanistan Resettlement Programme, to create safe and legal routes so those suffering at the hands of the Taliban can make a new life here in Britain. The Government’s proposal to take just an initial 5,000 refugees followed by only 20,000 over 5 years is not enough. Many of those at the highest risk will not survive waiting for five years to escape the Taliban. This policy must urgently be expanded to ensure people to whom we owe a huge debt are not abandoned because of an arbitrary target. And the promises made by ministers in Parliament must be reflected on the ground.</p>
<p>I support the deployment of troops to Kabul to provide security and capacity to carry out the evacuation. Soldiers and diplomats must be given the resources that they need. But it is increasingly clear there was a failure to plan for a safe and swift evacuation process and ministers have serious questions to answer over the lack of preparedness. Having said that I am also very grateful to Ambassador Bristow who is personally processing applications from Afghan nationals for refuge, and to Lord Tariq Ahmad who has been helping me to get a woman activist under threat and her husband out of Kabul.</p>
<p>Our veterans who served in Afghanistan as well as the families of those who died serving our country must know that their sacrifices were not in vain. The differences they have made to women and girls in particular are immense. What they must be feeling must be overwhelming; we must make sure that they get the resources and support they need.</p>
<p>The Taliban must be judged on what they do, not what they say. There are worrying reports of night raids and arrests of suspects by armed men with a number of local journalists and civil rights workers believed to have been detained. Women face obliteration of their rights, despite the warm words of the Taliban that too many have been willing to entertain. There have been reports of women being sent home from work and told to send their male relatives instead. There are reports of girls as young as ten are being sold off to Taliban fighters, mothers are having their eyes gouged out in front of their children, and reprisals against those who helped coalition forces. According to the UNHCR, women and children make up 80% of those fleeing the conflict.</p>
<p>The role of Pakistan in this conflict is absolutely key. During my speech, I called on the Foreign Secretary to restore specific aid funding to Pakistan in response to the influx of Afghan refugees who are crossing into Pakistan, as 350,000 Afghans are on the move inside the country.</p>
<p>The Pakistani Ambassador to the European Union, Zaheer Aslam Janjua recently disclosed that “Pakistan doesn’t have the capacity or the resources to take any more refugees” as Pakistan is already home to more than 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees, according to UN data. However, it is also home to an estimated two million more unregistered Afghan refugees, according to Pakistani government estimates.</p>
<p>Pakistan also has a potential role in moderating the Taliban’s behaviour. I am hopeful that the commitment that Pakistan has expressed to me over human rights in Kashmir will extend across the region – as you know human rights are universal. Pakistan has made clear that they need help from the international community in keeping the region terrorist-free and managing the 1600mile Durand line, which separates Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is something we could do collectively as this porous border poses a threat not just to Pakistan but to us all especially as there are already concerns that the Taliban might begin to question the legitimacy of the border now that it is in power.</p>
<p>The steps that Pakistan now takes will be vitally important as the Taliban’s takeover will affect the country more deeply than any other regional power and it is important that the UK government remains in dialogue with the Pakistani Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In the longer term, global Britain must work with its allies to restore not just our reputation but our role in facilitating a law and rules-based system with human rights across the world.</p>
<p>Please be assured, I will do all I can to continue to highlight the plight of the Afghan people.</p>

    <title>Afghanistan Statement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/08/18/afghanistan-statement/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=afghanistan-statement" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>The scenes from Afghanistan are truly horrifying. I am certain that the humanitarian crisis now unfolding was not inevitable. The chaos being unleashed from the utter collapse in the Afghan government and civil society will stain history for years to come, as the people of Afghanistan enter into a new age of turmoil and destruction.</p>
<p>Those of us who have followed events over the past few decades have drawn inspiration from the work of our service personnel, NGOs and Afghan people who have worked so hard to rebuild their society after so much violence. The images beaming back from Afghanistan are ones we never wanted to see.</p>
<p>I know of people in Bristol South with friends and family in Afghanistan and they are desperate for news of their loved ones. They want to know how they can help. Our greatest gift is our humanity. We all wonder what we would do, how would we cope and what would we want from others in these times. Over the coming days and weeks, I hope we have more clarity on the situation and details on what practical help individuals can provide for those fleeing and those who remain.</p>
<p>But with all the good will in the world, ultimately there is a limit as to what individuals can achieve. We needed much more from our government over the past months and years as the situation worsened but there is still much they can do. Firstly, focusing on the humanitarian suffering and leading efforts within the UK, NATO and in our role as leader of the G7, and also recognising that the security situation in Afghanistan has serious implications for the safety of the UK and our allies at home. Taliban rule could facilitate a resurgence of ISIS and al-Qaeda, which has been held at bay by the NATO presence in Afghanistan since 2001.</p>
<p>The fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban will also permeate the UK’s ability to act with decisiveness in the decades to come. We have already seen Chinese state media boasting how Taiwan should no longer feel safe about western guarantees in the Straits of Taiwan, and Russia will no doubt use this as further evidence that their foreign policy objectives in Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltics are tolerated by NATO.</p>
<p>I am proud to be a Bristol MP. Our city is a City of Sanctuary and one that has welcomed refugees in the past. We are also the political home Ernie Bevin, the Labour Party’s great post-war Foreign Secretary who did so much to forge Britain’s role in building international institutions, like NATO, to promote peace. Our humanity and politics mean we do not turn our backs, we are never safe if terror is allowed to thrive elsewhere.</p>
<p>As former Prime Minister Theresa May said today, we must now redouble our efforts in renewing NATO. Its role and position in defending international peace has been challenged by the events of the past week. We cannot allow its standing in the world to be undermined.</p>
<p>The debate and legacy of the UK’s involvement in recent wars has led to a culture of looking inwards and believing that not intervening is a noble position without consequences. We are seeing the effect of that, and I hope a more informed and nuanced debate about our role in the world and how we support peaceful partnerships beyond our own neighbourhood of nations starts to happen.</p>
<p>I will be working with women across Parliament to ensure that the rights of women in Afghanistan are considered throughout the coming months. Harriet Harman expertly put it to the Foreign Secretary that he must speak to the women in Afghanistan and surrounding nations. All too often they are forgotten and under Taliban rule they will be silenced. We cannot allow this to become the accepted norm in international diplomacy.</p>
<p>At present optimism is our only raft in these turbulent times. My optimism remains that the people of Afghanistan, particularly the courageous women who have taken a public lead in the last two decades, will have tasted the freedom many of us take for granted. It is my sincere belief that they, and the generation they helped, will not be vanquished. But they need to know we have not forgotten or abandoned them.</p>
<p>I’m already in touch with constituents seeking news of family and friends. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are searching for answers and I will do all I can to get answers from the Foreign Office and Home Office.

    <title>Emma Meets with Tyne Tunnel 2 Executives</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-meets-with-tyne-tunnel-2-executives/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I met with the Chief Exec and Operations Manager of Tyne Tunnel 2 to raise concerns following a spike in complaints about the tunnel operators since the introduction of the controversial “pay later” scheme. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with many of the complaints, I believe that the payment instructions could be clearer. The ticket states a date and a time however, if you wait until the date shown, it’ll be too late and you’ll incur a £30 fine, I can see how many people are easily misunderstanding what the ticket says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, I asked the Chief Executive, Phill Smith if he could look at other options and suggested changes should be made to the wording on the tickets to make it clearer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I learnt about plans for the tunnel to remove the barriers completely in a new system called&amp;nbsp;Open Road Tolling.&amp;nbsp; This would mean that there would be no barriers and payments will need to be made either using an online account or the pay later option. Tyne Tunnel 2 say this would increase tunnel capacity, reduce carbon emissions and mean more a more reliable and quicker journey through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I again expressed concern that more drivers may receive fines, as the onus would be&amp;nbsp;on drivers to remember to pay the toll as under the new system, they would not receive a ticket which in many cases acts as a reminder. I also asked what facilities have TT2 put in place to support those drivers who do not have access to the internet, in order to pay their toll charge. It was explained that drivers who do not have smart phones or access to the internet could pay their toll at shops who have a PayPoint facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I feel many constituents’ pain and frustration. Many people have told me that the current system of pay later is confusing and lacks clarity, I agree and will continue to seek a resolution to this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Coronavirus issues and other local matters.<br/>
<strong><br/>
International Travel</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I have been asked by a number of people about the current rules for travel outside the UK and returning here. To find out what the rules are for entering any other country, you should look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Office Travel Advice</a>, which will tell you what the entry requirements are at the moment in each country.</p>
<p>For re-entering the UK, all of the current advice is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>South Western Railway &amp; Network Rail Timetable Consultation</strong></p>
<p>South Western Railway and Network Rail have launched a consultation about their plans for the post-Pandemic timetable from December 2022 onwards. This consultation is based on an assumption that considerably fewer people will be commuting going forward. The proposals represent a significant downgrading of the pre-pandemic timetable for our line into London Waterloo. They are intending to reduce the number of trains from Ashtead and Epsom in the peak from six trains an hour to four. This would be done by scrapping the services that start at Epsom and making the previous semi-fast service stop at Ewell West and Stoneleigh instead, as well as at all stations further in. At the same time they would make the current reduction in off-peak services permanent.</p>
<p>They will also at the same time introduce the new generation of trains onto our line, which are ten coaches with all of them connected to create an open plan route right through the train. Their argument is that the new trains will have significantly more capacity and will be able to carry as many people as before even with a reduced service. I do not buy that argument. I have met the company to raise my concerns about the plans, and I think it is much too early to judge what passenger numbers will be in nearly eighteen months time. This level of service would have been completely unworkable with pre-pandemic passenger numbers. I would encourage everyone to take part in the consultation and to make your view clear. The details are at <strong><a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/timetables/timetable-consultation-december-2022">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom &amp; Ewell Business Awards 2011-2021</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Epsom and Ewell Business Awards have just been launched for online entries and nominations. This will be the tenth year of the awards, and it’s a great opportunity to nominate your favourite local business, perhaps because of what they have done for you during the pandemic or because they just always look after you really well. Details of how to enter or nominate an entry are <strong><a href="https://www.epsombusinessawards.co.uk/">here</a></strong>. Please do get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering in the Local Community</strong></p>
<p>I know that many people locally put their names forward to volunteer in the community during the pandemic, and either have now finished that work or did not find the right opportunity to do so. If you are someone who is motivated to get involved or frustrated because your help wasn’t needed, I am planning a volunteering event to match potential volunteers with a small group of local charities who need extra help.</p>
<p>The event will be at <strong>St George’s, in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead on Friday 10th September</strong> from 4 until 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I will be sending out more details a few days before, but if you are interested please make a note in your diary.</p>
<p>I hope that you manage to enjoy something of a break this summer and that the weather improves.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br/>
Chris</p>

    <title>Christina Rees MP backs the Labour Party safer communities campaign following pledges to crack down on anti-social behaviour</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/christina-rees-mp-backs-the-labour-party-safer-communities-campaign-following-pledges-to-crack-down-on-anti-social-behaviour/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, has backed the Labour Party’s safer communities summer campaign as the Party pledges to crack down on anti-social behaviour and end violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>The Tories have cut police to the lowest level in a generation and cut funding for services that prevent crime from happening, leading to the loss of thousands of officers on the frontline and a £1.6bn shortfall in funding.</p>
<p>These decisions have helped cause a surge in anti-social behaviour, leaving people afraid in their homes.  Latest figures show that in this year alone police have recorded over 2 million incidents of anti-social behaviour – the highest in seven years.  This is just a fraction of the estimated 13.6 million adults who have witnessed or experienced anti-social behaviour during the same period.</p>
<p>The Labour Party would prioritise making communities safer by redirecting the £280 million earmarked for Boris Johnson’s new UK Government yacht and spend it in areas like Neath to tackle anti-social behaviour, putting more police on the beat in our communities, and strengthening legal protections for victims of antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, said:</p>
<p>“The Tories in Westminster are weak on crime, cutting police and prevention services with little thought of how communities, such as ours in Neath, will suffer as a result.</p>
<p>“The Welsh Labour Government have stood up against Tory cuts by funding 500 Police Community Support Officers.  A UK Labour Government would support them by giving victims more rights in law and putting more police officers on the beat.</p>
<p>“Together, Welsh and UK Labour would prioritise making our streets safer, instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on a flashy new UK Government yacht like Boris Johnson.  People shouldn’t be afraid in their own homes, and it doesn’t have to be like this. It’s time for the safety of our communities to be taken seriously.”</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my July&nbsp;email newsletter. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well during this challenging time, as we start to try to return to normality from the pandemic and enjoy the Summer, whilst still trying to be cautious and sensible with precautions where possible&nbsp;in the face of rising cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is only right that at this critical juncture in our journey out of lockdown, we take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices of the wonderful people who make up our NHS, our key workers, and all those involved in the vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you&#8217;ll find updates on the latest cases and vaccination restrictions, a link to my new online survey and details of what&#8217;s been happening in Parliament and around Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Online Summer Survey – let me know your views:</u></strong></p>



<p>As we head towards Summer Recess in Parliament, I’m about to start delivering my annual report across Amber Valley – please say hello if you see me out and about.</p>



<p>In the report and online, I’m launching a survey to get your views on local issues and recovering from Covid-19, from health appointments to boosting our economy.</p>



<p>Please take just a couple of minutes to complete my Summer Survey and let me know your views <a href="https://www.nigelmillsmp.com/nigels-summer-survey/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing Lockdown Restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 19<sup>th </sup>July 2021, the Government lifted all remaining restrictions on social distancing in England. This represents a further step towards normality as we adjust to living with this virus. Although coronavirus cases are continuing to rise nationally, we have not seen the corresponding rise in hospitalisations and deaths that we would expect given the rates of illness we observed last year. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly clear that the link between infections and serious illness is sufficiently broken to enable this further relaxation of restrictions. However, we must remain careful and exercise our own good judgement to keep transmission in our local community to a minimum.</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Case Rates</u></strong></p>



<p>The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant continues to spread across the country and Public Health England (PHE) is now confident that it has overtaken the Alpha variant to become the most dominant strain of the virus circulating in the UK. The Delta variant is believed to be around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which itself is more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. Encouragingly however, new analysis by PHE shows that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.</p>



<p>As predicted in light of this, cases continue to rise nationally, and this trend is no different locally in Amber Valley. You can find the latest case data <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read?postcode=DE7%206DG">here</a>. We are now ahead of the England average which highlights the need for us to remain careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Vaccines</u></strong></p>



<p>The Country’s vaccine program continues apace with more than 46.2 million people in the UK having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine &#8211; part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.</p>



<p>I was pleased to see the rollout expanded after the Government hit its target of offering a first jab to everyone in the top priority groups &#8211; all those over the age of 50, plus those in high-risk categories by mid-April. With every adult in the UK now having been offered their first dose of the vaccine. A terrific effort, nationally and locally.</p>



<p>As of last Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> July, Amber Valley had successfully given at least one dose of the vaccine to 88% of local adults, with 72.8% having received both jabs. This remains slightly above the average for England which stands at 87.7% of adults having received one jab, and 68% both jabs. These figures are a testament to the exemplary vaccine program here in our constituency.</p>



<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team, and the local NHS to ensure that this area continues to see the full roll out of vaccines.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing of restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>As of Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July, all legal restrictions on social distancing in England have been lifted. This is truly excellent news, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing Amber Valley businesses, organisations, and individuals operating at full capacity without legal restrictions.</p>



<p>The following measures are now in place across England:</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on how many people can meet.</p>



<p>&#8211; 1m-plus rule removed (except in some places like hospitals).</p>



<p>&#8211; Face coverings no longer required by law.</p>



<p>&#8211; Nightclubs can open.</p>



<p>&#8211; Pubs and restaurants no longer table service only.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on guests at weddings and funerals.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on people attending concerts, theatres or sports events.</p>



<p>&#8211; No restrictions on communal worship.</p>



<p>It is important to remember, however, that this easing of restrictions is designed to empower ourselves as individuals to use our common sense to slow the spread of the virus, which is still very present in our communities. Therefore, I implore you to enjoy these new freedoms responsibly.</p>



<p>As ever, to find out more information on what restrictions apply in your area please look <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting our local economy</u></strong></p>



<p>As we try to re-open, it&#8217;s key to support our local economy to bounce back, and provide a boost to local jobs and businesses. Unemployment is Amber Valley is currently at 4.2%, which is below the national average of 5.6% and 150 lower than in May 2021. As the Job Retention Scheme (furlough) starts to wind down, we need to remain cautious, but there are lots of vacancies around and local employers advertising job opportunities, including the Kickstart Scheme to help young people get back into work. I&#8217;ll also look to organise a Job Fair, maybe initially virtually, over the next few months &#8211; please get in touch if you&#8217;d like to be involved in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Borders Bill</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve recently welcomed the Government’s New Plan for Immigration, also known as the Borders Bill, into parliament. This legislation intends to:</p>



<ul><li>Speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals.</li><li>Introduce maximum life sentences for people smugglers.</li><li>Empower the Border Force to do more to stop and seize small boats and search containers for hidden migrants.</li><li>Stop illegal arrivals gaining immediate entry into the asylum system if they have travelled through a safe county (like France).</li><li>Increase the maximum sentence for illegally entering the UK.</li><li>Grant resettled refugees indefinite leave to remain.</li><li>Better integrate refugees who are resettled.</li></ul>



<p>I know constituents want more to be done to reduce illegal immigration. I will, therefore, continue to engage with ministers throughout this Bill’s journey through parliament to ensure the Government delivers on its manifesto commitments of reducing illegal immigration to UK.</p>



<p><strong><u>In Parliament:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament this month, I&#8217;ve been asking questions on travel restrictions, catch-up education and English Votes for English Laws legislation.</p>



<p>During recent questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, I raised the issue on behalf of constituents of families with children under 18 wanting to travel abroad, but who aren&#8217;t eligible for the vaccine as yet. I&#8217;m pleased the Secretary of State agreed to look into this issue, and you can find out more on his answer <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-19b.670.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g680.4">here</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also asked the Secretary of State for Education about catch-up tutoring for school pupils following the pandemic, and you can find the full debate on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-06c.768.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g776.0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, during Business Questions in the House, I asked about the continuation of English Votes for English Laws legislation, as part of a continued fair settlement of devolution across the UK. You can find more on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-06-24b.1011.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1023.2">here</a>&nbsp;and on my Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/nigelmills">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Solar Farm</u></strong></p>



<p>Locally, I’ve been working with local residents and councillors to help oppose plans to construct a 310-acre solar farm on a vast swathe of green space between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. The solar farm has been proposed by Kronos Solar and is subject to several planning applications across Amber Valley Borough Council and North East Derbyshire District Council. I think this would destroy our local landscape due it&#8217;s scale and extent, so whilst I&#8217;m not against renewable energy or solar panels, I think these applications are inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The applications are still awaiting determination by the councils (likely to be in September) so there&#8217;s still time to comment or lodge any concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find details of the residents&#8217; objection group, and information on the individual applications and how to comment if you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savealfretoncountryside/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council Local Plan consultation &#8211; Have your say!</u></strong></p>



<p>The new administration at the Borough Council has launched a new consultation on the next stage of preparing Amber Valley&#8217;s Local Plan, a development document which will set out and plan future housing growth in the area, and making sure we have the infrastructure improvements to match any new homes. I welcome the planned reduction in the overall number of new homes being proposed, which is part of the consultation. The Council are also consulting on the options for the overall strategy (spatial strategy) of the plan, which include focusing housing growth on the Derby City urban area border, in and around Amber Valley&#8217;s four key towns, or in the wider area and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation on the proposals and headline strategy for the plan so far is open from now until the 30th September 2021. Please do take opportunity to feed in your views to the Council &#8211; I know how strongly residents rightly feel over housing in our area, and so this is the most important chance to have your say on making sure we protect our Green Belt and shaping&nbsp;the future of planning in our area. You can find the consultation and how to submit your views on the proposals <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/alternative-spatial-strategy-options-for-housing-and-economic-growth/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>“Universal Credit uplift should be permanent” says city councillor</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/07/22/universal-credit-uplift-should-be-permanent-says-city-councillor/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In response to a question at July Full Council, the Portfolio Holder for Finance and Resources has called on the Government to retain the £20 a week uplift in Universal Credit&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;highlighting how it supports many low paid working people in Nottingham.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham and in response to the pandemic in April last year the Government introduced an increase in payments of £20 a week. There is growing speculation that the Government will reverse the uplift later this year resulting in increasing difficulty for many people who are already struggling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to a question at Full Council on the issue, Cllr Sam Webster said “Universal Credit supports low paid working people in our city, tens of thousands of children in our city and people who are entitled to support with housing costs or have lost their job during the Covid pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Webster commenting on the
consequences of the £20 a week uplift being reversed warned that “It will often
be felt most acutely by Nottingham children who are growing up in families
where there already isn’t much money around, families who are living in
poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January this year Nottingham City Council passed a motion urging the Government to retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit and urging an extension of the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support. This was followed up by a letter from the Leader of Nottingham City Council to the Chancellor emphasising the importance of the £20 a week uplift. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cllr Webster continued his response by saying “Lower paid and lower skilled working people are much more likely to have lost their job, not be able to work from home, have additional childcare needs, have gone through periods of Covid isolation without receiving pay, have lost hours at work&amp;#8230;.and the list goes on.&amp;nbsp;Reducing Universal Credit now would be big blow to many families who are already struggling to make ends meet.” He also argued that the uplift in Universal Credit should be seen as a litmus test for how seriously the Government is about levelling, saying to not make the uplift permanent would be a case of “levelling down”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cllr Webster ended by saying “In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago it was (and still is) shameful that the poorest people in this country were made to pay the price of mistakes made by the wealthiest. In terms of the policies that our national politicians pursue &amp;#8211; this is one of those markers &amp;#8211; who will The Conservative Government expect to pay for this latest economic and public debt crisis?&amp;nbsp; The message from Labour in Nottingham is crystal clear &amp;#8211; let it not be the poorest families again.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cervical Screening e-petition debate 19/07/21</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://whitford.scot/2021/07/22/cervical-screening-e-petition-debate-19-07-21/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Delighted to take part in an excellent cross-party debate on Cervical Screening.  Human Papilloma Virus causes virtually all Cervical Cancer but we can prevent it &amp;#8211; through HPV vaccination &amp;amp; screening to identify women at risk. Although the petition specifically calls for annual cervical smear tests, what we are all actually trying to achieve is the prevention and eventual elimination of cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of cervical cancer, we need to get rid of the stigma of HPV and ensure that all women and young people understand its importance in the development of cancer. It is a very common virus, which, in the vast majority of cases, causes no harm and is cleared by the body’s own defences, but some strains pose a higher risk of causing malignant change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine was introduced for young teenage girls in 2008 and initially included those up to 18 years, so that they would be vaccinated before leaving school. The vaccine is now also provided to boys, both to protect them from other HPV-related cancers and to provide additional protection to women by reducing how many men carry HPV in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK National Screening Committee has recommended that women who are HPV-negative and therefore at very low risk are offered routine repeat screening every five years, from the ages of 25 to 65. That system has been fully rolled out in Scotland since March last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust suggests that a simpler at-home method of sampling could get more women to engage and take up HPV testing as the first step of screening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.jostrust.org.uk/"&gt;Jo&amp;#8217;s Cervical Cancer Trust | Cervical Cancer Charity (jostrust.org.uk)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please encourage your sons and daughters to take the HPV jag when offered at school, and do attend for your screening appointments. We can all work to prevent Cervical Cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can watch my speech in full below:&lt;/p&gt;

<p>After holding a constituents surgery in the morning, Mr Shapps went to the Galleria in Hatfield to visit Potential Kids. There, Grant went to see how they had been doing since the launch of their ‘Learn to Ride’ sessions earlier in April.</p>
<p>Potential Kids is a local charity that provides learning, social and sport opportunities to children who are neurodiverse, as well as their families. Their ‘Learn to Ride’ programme provides 1 on 1 bike riding lessons to children.</p>
<p>Speaking about the visit Angela Gaughan, founder of Potential Kids said: “We were delighted to have the opportunity to talk with the Grant Shapps about the joint project between Hatfields Mens Sheds and Potential Kids.</p>
<p>“Being able to teach children and young people to ride and maintain a bike provides life-long skills that promote independence, mental health and self-esteem, whilst encouraging physical activity and time spent outdoors in the fresh air.</p>
<p>“Grant also had the opportunity to see our Community and Learning Garden project, ‘Potential to Grow’, which has been successfully running over the last 11 months.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for the support we have received in developing this project. Our continued thanks go to Tim Sterling, Center Director at the Galleria for our Hub and Garden and to Welwyn Hatfield Council for their support to build our new kitchen area. Which will enable us to run fun cooking sessions for neurodiverse children, young people, their siblings, and families in the local area, using healthy ingredients grown in our very own garden.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “Potential Kids look to be doing brilliant work here. I’ve spent a bit of time talking to the leaders here and learning about their work, and the cycling programme more specifically.</p>
<p>“Cycling is great way to get from A to B- it’s healthy for you, and great for the planet. Learning to ride a bike as a child is something that all kids should experience, and it’s great to see that Potential Kids are helping make sure every child has that opportunity.”</p></div>

Mr Shapps toured some recent changes in the town centre, including a new outdoor dining area.</p>
<p> A representative of WGC BID said: “<span style="font-size: 14px;">We thank Grant for taking time out of his very busy schedule to come to WGC town centre and hear about the BID renewal and how the businesses in WGC are coping with the impact of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">“It has been a tough time for everyone but we are working together to ensure the recovery of our town centre”</span></p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “As we are moving away from covid restrictions- thanks in no small part to our amazing vaccination effort- it’s vital that our local businesses can get back on their feet and adapt to life post-covid.</p>
<p>“Visiting the town centre in Welwyn Garden City today and meeting with the local BID group, I’m confident that we’ll be able to spring back and make the most of what life post-covid has to offer.”</p></div>

<p>Mr Shapps- who is also the UK Transport Secretary- met with Tricia and the team at Off Broadway Travel to listen to their experience of international travel in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The meeting came as Mr Shapps recently announced that double vaccinated Brits would no longer have to isolate after travelling to ‘amber list’ countries from 19 July.</p>
<p>Natalie Bennett, a partner at Off Broadway Travel, told Travel Weekly: “He took everything on board, he listened to us, and it went well. He appreciated that travel had been made illegal and said he would talk to the chancellor [about further sector specific support].</p>
<p>Off Broadway Travel tweeted after the visit, saying: “A very productive meeting with @grantshapps today our local MP. Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to listen &amp; understand out sector….”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “I had a very useful discussion with the team at Off Broadway Travel today. They told me about the challenges they’ve faced as a business  over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>“As we unlock domestically, and take some first steps towards flying internationally again, I want to make sure I’m best representing all parts of the transport sector.”</p></div>

<p>There seems to be a webinar for everything — from cooking an apple pie and setting up your email list to creating a company and making your first million. This form of interaction with the target audience became popular for a good reason. It allows to achieve numerous goals:</p>



<ul><li>Selling products</li><li>Attracting new audience</li><li>Improving engagement</li><li>Building and improving brand awareness</li><li>Creating an image of an expert for yourself or your company</li><li>Distributing content</li></ul>



<p>And that’s we’ve just scratched the surface. Every person who creates a webinar has their own unique goals in mind. This wide array of benefits is what makes webinars such a great way to promote your brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="706" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-164" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-325x211.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-166" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
