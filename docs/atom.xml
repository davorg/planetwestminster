<p><span><span><span>That’s why I am always delighted to be asked by my constituents to help them access one of the 130,000 free guided ‘Inside UK Parliament’ tours that are held each year by the Visitors Experience Team.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Having had a flurry of such requests in recent days, I wanted to take the opportunity to shine a light on these wonderful tours for those that may not be aware of their existence. Full details can be found <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-and-tours/tours-of-parliament/tours/">here</a>  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Demand can be high but, with enough notice, the Tours Office are brilliant at finding a date/time that suits those who wish to come along and find out more.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If YOU would be interested in such a tour, please do email me at <a href="mailto:george.freeman.mp@parliament.uk">george.freeman.mp@parliament.uk</a> or write to me at 8 Damgate Street, Wymondham, NR18 0BQ – providing the names of those in your party, as well as the address and post code of the person organising the visit. I’d love to help you get a visit arranged.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <title>Isles MP – Highly Protected Marine Areas – Legislation Should be Dropped</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2023/03/20/isles-mp-highly-protected-marine-areas-legislation-should-be-dropped/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil says he is strongly opposed to proposals for Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMA) and urges island stakeholders to make their views heard in the consultation which closes on April 17.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil will write to the Minister for Environment and Land Reform, Mairi McAllan, to stress the strength of feeling against the proposals in the islands and calls for the legislation to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “HPMAs are ill-conceived, not thought through, and are not something that any island or coastal community would impose upon themselves. It is driven by people who don’t understand the issues.&amp;nbsp; In short, the whole scheme should be put in a recycling dustbin.&amp;nbsp; Having taken part in an online consultation last month, and as an islander, I got little comfort from the concepts and was only alarmed at the idea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thankfully no such step has been thought of, for the countryside or in cities. &amp;nbsp;Making a blanket 10% of places, at land or sea ‘verboten’ is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Small-scale environmentally harmonious activity has been going on for generations, and these Marine Protected areas will destroy much of that. Island communities need to be protected from these so-called environmental protectors, who are damaging and many feel even dangerous, with their ill-conceived schemes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I will write to the Scottish Government urging a re-think on these damaging proposals and I hope that the strength of feeling from island communities is relayed in the consultation.&amp;nbsp; It may of course come to pass that a change in SNP First Minister could signal the end of these doomsday proposals.&amp;nbsp; I will certainly encourage any new First Minister to ditch this dangerous bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The closing date is April 17th, and I would urge constituents to make their voices heard and submit responses even if it is a short response, simply saying it should be ditched.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Link to the Consultation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://consult.gov.scot/marine-scotland/scottish-highly-protected-marine-areas/"&gt;Scottish Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs) &amp;#8211; Scottish Government &amp;#8211; Citizen Space (consult.gov.scot)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have set out before on this site my own concerns about what has been agreed.</p>
<p>The government has still to tell us which EU laws will apply in Northern Ireland, how wide ranging the powers of the European Court of Justice will be, what limits are placed on our ability to impose VAT and Excise taxes, why EU law on many items applies to trade between GB and NI and why it applies to factories and farms in the province not exporting to the EU. They have not yet released the forms traders will need to fill in to send goods from GB to NI or what are the terms of the trusted trader scheme which shippers will need to join and follow.</p>
<p>The brake itself is a burdensome arrangement. If two parties and the requisite number of NI Assembly members want to apply it, the UK government then has to decide if the criteria are met to allow its use and if they wish to use it, bearing in mind the ability of the EU to take retaliatory action. I can imagine UK government lawyers and officials urging caution any time some politicians wished to use the brake. When the EU built up the number of areas that could proceed by majority voting rather than  unanimity in the EU we were always told there was the Luxembourg Compromise. This was a self styled  emergency brake which we could apply to an item we disagreed with which had gained the necessary majority to become law. The UK never used it and in due course it was deemed to no longer exist. When I wanted to use it as the UK’s single market Minister I was blocked from doing so.  If we had enjoyed an effective legislative brake on laws we did not like we would probably still be in the EU today. Instead the railroading of laws onto us was one of the main reasons we voted to leave.</p>
<p>The Protocol should  not be embedded into UK and international law. The Agreement looks as if it leaves too many EU laws applying to NI, still places obstacles in the way of GB to NI internal trade and does not allow us either a veto over laws  nor a unilateral way out of this worrying Agreement.</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-88/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">My week started with Mr Speaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1633063262508969984?cxt=HHwWgMCzmdGY56ktAAAA">calling me to ask a question</a> in Department for Work and Pensions Oral Questions. If an MP is not selected to be included in the listed questions on the Order Paper, there is a convention that Mr Speaker can call that MP to ask a supplementary question, but the MP has to stand up when the particular question they want to be included in is called, so that the Speaker is aware that the MP wants to be called. This is called “bobbing”. I wasn’t fortunate to be on the Order Paper, so I bobbed, throughout the listed questions, but I wasn’t called. But there is a Topical Section on the Order Paper following the listed questions for most Department Oral Questions, which allows MPs to ask a question on any subject within that Departmental brief. So I continued to bob and was nearly the last question to be called in the Topical Questions section. I referred to <a href="https://www.bevanfoundation.org/resources/wales-housing-crisis-summer-2022/">research by the Bevan Foundation</a> in February 2023, which showed that Local Housing Allowance (LHA), which is the responsibility of the UK Government, is not the solution to the cost of living crisis and housing crisis for families who are on low incomes and the most vulnerable. The LHA determines how much assistance a low income household living in the private rental sector can receive towards their rent through the benefits system. But LHA rates have been frozen by the UK Government since 2020, whilst private rental costs have escalated. There is a severe shortage of private rental properties available at LHA rates. Only 32 properties across Wales were advertised as available at LHA rates, which is 1.2% of the market, and 16 of the 22 local authorities did not have a single property available at LHA rates. Households on low incomes are faced with moving into an unaffordable property, sometimes of poor standard, risking financial hardship, or seek assistance from local authority homelessness services. I asked whether the Minister, Mims Davies MP, would help people who are most in need by uprating the Local Housing Allowance to reflect current private rental costs. Unfortunately, the Minister did not answer the question, and referred to her UK Government’s support package for most vulnerable households, which includes the household element of Universal Credit, or those entitled to housing benefit, and discretionary housing payments from local authorities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I rushed from the Chamber to attend the AGM of the All Party Group (APPG) for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and was proud to be re-elected vice-chair. John Howell MP was re-elected chair. ADR is a method of resolving disputes between consumers and traders that doesn’t involve going to court. In the UK there are 4 main types of ADR. Independent negotiation is the first option, because in some cases, both parties can solve arguments by taking a ‘cards on the table’ approach and attempting a compromise. If required, ADR specialists can take instructions and negotiate on behalf of the parties. Mediation; when a mediator is a jointly instructed neutral party, who assists with communication between the parties to achieve a settlement, but not offer an opinion or assessment. Conciliation; is a common ADR used for employment disputes, and is a mandatory process before an employee can take a claim to an employment tribunal. The conciliator will discuss the issues and try and help the parties reach an agreement often providing their own opinion. Arbitration; where an independent third party, often a specialist in the field of dispute, considers the facts and takes a decision that’s often binding on one or both parties. In the UK, there are well established ADR schemes for financial services, energy, and telecoms, but it is expanding in its popularity, because it is less formal, less costly, less stressful and often much quicker than court proceedings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called in to the Endometriosis UK Action Month event. Endometriosis is a condition where cells similar to those lining the womb are found elsewhere in the body. Each month they react to the menstrual cycle in the same way as in the womb, building up, breaking down and bleeding. But this blood has no way to escape and leads to inflammation, pain, and scar tissue. The condition affects over 1.5 million in the UK, approximately 1 in 10 women, and those assigned female at birth. Common symptoms include pelvic pain, difficult periods, pain when urinating, painful bowel movements, and fatigue. I agreed to become a member of the APPG for Endometriosis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was in the Chamber to listen to the Home Secretary deliver her statement about the Illegal Migration Bill. She said her decisions are supported by the British people through their elected representatives not by people smugglers and other criminals breaking into Britain daily. She said that the Bill will stop the boats bringing tens of thousands to our shores in flagrant breach of our laws and the will of the British people. She blamed illegal arrivals for overwhelming our asylum system, which increased the backlog of over 160,000. And that they should have claimed asylum in the safe countries they had passed through, such as Albania. She said that the vast majority were adult males under 40 rich enough to pay criminal gangs thousands for safe passage. If you enter Britain illegally you will be detained and swiftly removed, to your home country or to a safe country like Rwanda. The Bill enables detention of illegal arrivals for 28 days without bail or judicial review, until they are removed. The Home Secretary can suspend removal only to those under 18, medically unfit to fly, or at risk of serious and irreversible harm. And when they’ve stopped the boats, the Bill will introduce an annual cap on the number of refugees the UK will settle via safe and legal routes. She said the British people are fair and patient but they’ve seen their country taken for a ride.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many MPs on both sides of the chamber were shocked by the Home Secretary’s language and answers to questions regarding her statement posed by MPs. I think that the Rt. Honourable Member for Haynes and Harrington, John McDonnell’s question and the Home Secretary’s answer summed it up. “<em>I have nearly 2,000 people who have exercised their legal right to claim asylum living in hotels in my constituency, probably more than any other MP. I welcome them into my constituency. I have toured the hotels, met many of them, and held advice sessions. They come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Kurdistan-Iraq, Iran and Eritrea. Some of them have shown me their wounds from torture, many are suffering post traumatic stress disorder. They have been in the hotels for 12 to 18 months. I am amazed by the range of skills and qualifications that people have. They just want employment. They want to be able to contribute. They want a job and to contribute to our society and our economy, but they are trapped in this system because of the lack of processing. I take up their cases and get sheets of the same three or four sentence responses, and the cases move no further. Could the Home Secretary at least provide the House with a monthly report on how the processing of their cases is proceeding? May I say one final thing Mr Speaker? Will the Home Secretary please tone down her inflammatory language? It is putting these people and those who represent them at risk.</em>“</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Suella Braverman replied “We are making good progress in bearing down on the legacy backlog in our asylum system. We have increased the number of decision makers and streamlined the decision-making process, and we are increasing productivity. We will continue to bear down on that because it is a big factor in the hotel accommodation issue”.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of asylum seekers do not have the right to work, so many rely on state support, currently set at £40.85 per week, that’s £5.84 per day for food, sanitation and clothing. Housing is provided, but asylum seekers cannot choose where, and it’s often hard to let properties which council tenants do not want to live in. The UK had 72,027 asylum seekers at the year ending September 2022, and does not have more asylum seekers than other countries. In the EU, Germany had the highest, 127,730, followed by France, 96,510. According to UNHCR statistics, in the UK at the end of November 2022, there were 231,597 refugees, 127,421 pending asylum cases, and 5,483 stateless persons. The war in Ukraine drove a large increase from the previous year. The backlog is produced by the historical lack of staffing in the Home Office to deal with applications.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a massive reaction to the Bill since last Monday, including: The Red Cross said that the Bill breaks the UN 1951 Convention; The Archbishop of York condemned the Bill and said that it is cruelty without purpose and is immoral and inept; more than 350 charities, businesses, unions, and legal groups said the Bill is cruel and unworkable to detain and immediately deport people coming to the UK in small boats, and will break the UN Charter and European Convention on Human Rights; Lord Dubs said that the Bill is a reversal of undertakings the UK Government gave that children would be exempt, and children would not be able to claim asylum and would be removed; and Baptist, Methodist, and the United Reform Church leaders said that the Bill fosters discrimination, distrust, and causes immeasurable harm to people already vulnerable from conflict and persecution, and is an example of ignoring our neighbours and walking by on the other side.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so grateful that the people of Wales are compassionate towards strangers, and we are a Nation of Sanctuary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to be re-elected vice chair at the AGM of the APPG Coalfields Communities. Alex Davies-Jones MP was re-elected chair. The APPG received a presentation by the Secretariat, Industrial Communities Alliance, on the next steps in their ‘Levelling Up the Former Coalfields’ Inquiry, whose remit is to give the APPG a clear strategic direction. The inquiry will publish its report and recommendations in the near future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG for Hospitality, Events, and Major Food and Drink Businesses in Wales, chaired by Jess Morden MP. We received an update from businesses in Wales, which included: Dave Chapman, Executive Director for Wales, UK Hospitality; Nick Newman, chair of Pubs Cardiff; Glen Evans, vice chair of North Wales Tourism; Daniel Bounds, Sales Director, ICC Wales and Deputy Chairman of ICA; Mike Morgan, Welsh Rarebits Collection; and Rod Ali of Taste Wales Trade Association. Dave told us that the UKH Cymru Conference is planned for May, and the UKH Conference will be in June. All speakers agreed that the Chancellor should provide financial help for the hospitality, events and businesses sector in the UK, which will benefit those in Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My Shark Fins Private Members Bill completed all legislative stages in the House of Commons on 20th January and now proceeds to the House of Lords. I met with Maggie Jones, Baroness Jones of Whitchurch, who will be taking my Sharks Fins Private Members Bill through the House of Lords, starting with its Second Reading on Friday 24th March. I wanted to make sure that Maggie has all the briefing notes regarding the Bill, and answered any questions that she had. Baroness Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist will be the Conservative UK Government Minister, and Baroness Hayman of Ullock will be speaking for the Labour Front Bench.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG for Sport International Women’s Day event which was so well attended that people were sitting on the floor. We listened to inspirational sportswomen of all ages and backgrounds who told their stories of their involvement and dedication to sport. The Minister for Sport, Stuart Andrew MP, spoke first and pledged more funding for women and girls in grassroots sport.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sense is a national disability charity that supports the UK’s 1.6million people with complex disabilities to be understood, connected and valued. Sense supports children, young people, and adults in their homes and in the community, and offers practical help to family carers including information advice, short breaks and family events. I attended Sense’s Parliamentary event on the cost of living crisis on disabled people. Sense is campaigning for: a benefits system that provides enough to live on, a review of the level, the process that sets benefits, and how they are updated; and targeted energy support for disabled people who use more energy, including a social tariff, and an urgent review of the list of medical equipment that qualify for energy rebates. Since the start of 2023, the situation has severely worsened for more than three quarters of disabled people, and over half are now in debt. Nearly half are missing meals to save money, struggling to keep their homes warm, and 20% using food banks. I hope that the Chancellor has listened to Sense and his budget next week will include help for disabled people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with representatives of The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and learned some new skills to draw attention to the importance of scientific research in solving challenges that affect constituents and people in the UK. The RSC is an international organisation connecting chemical scientists with each other and with society as a whole. Founded in London in 1841, with a current membership of over 50,000, it supports chemical scientists with resources to make vital advances in chemical knowledge, and teachers to inspire a future generation of scientists. Sophia Michell and Dr Ian Gameson from Lab Tots, which teaches fun science to nursery school children, showed me everyday chemistry that we can do with accessible materials at home. It was great to take part and meet Sophia and Ian, connect with science and learn about working together on evidence based policy ranging from climate change and energy security to economic growth. My thanks to Val Vaz MP for hosting the event.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I bobbed throughout the Women and Equalities Oral Questions because I wanted to highlight TUC statistics that show that despite the UK Government requiring companies employing over 250 to publish their gender pay gap information since 2017, there is still a widening gender pay gap, currently at 15%, and women are working for free for 54 days in the UK and 45 days in Wales. I would have asked the Minister whether she agreed with the General Secretary of Wales TUC, Shavanah Taj, that companies need clear targets, monitoring, evaluation, enforcement and fines for companies who don’t comply. Unfortunately, Mr Speaker didn’t call me, but I published my question on Social Media because I believe that the UK Government needs to do much more for women in the workplace.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a supporter of the RSPCA for many years, and I attended their event on the Impact of the Cost of Living Crisis on Animals. The RSPCA centres are full, 700 pets are on waiting lists, there is a 25% increase in pets abandoned, a 13% rise in neglect calls, the intake is up by 8%, rehoming is down by 8%, because people cannot afford to feed their pets. The RSPCA is collaborating with animal and human welfare charities to help keep pets in their home during the cost of living crisis. The RSPCA Partnership (Wales) was set up in the summer 2022 and it supports food banks across Wales to provide pet food. The RSPCA has set up a phone helpline to support peoooe worried about the cost of living crisis on 03001230650, open Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Champion MP hosted the International Rescue Committee event “Time to Stand with Women Leading in Crisis” and I was honoured to sign the pledge board “I stand with women leading in crisis”. Women are best positioned to lead during crisis and prevent gender based violence, but often their organisations are cut out of humanitarian response. The UK Government has published its Women’s and Girls Strategy and now is the time for the UK to stand with women leading in crisis: tackle systemic funding barriers; create space and decision making roles; and establish partnerships based on equity, trust and accountability.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG for State Pension, chaired by Andrew Gwynne MP and Peter Aldous MP, for a confidential briefing on Stage two of the PHSO investigation into DWP’s communication of changes to State Pension age and associated issues.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Public Order Bill came back to the Commons from the Lords where it had been amended by Labour and Cross-Bench peers working together to remove the draconian Conservative policies against civil liberties within the Bill, such as free speech and public assembly. The votes taken by the UK Government in the Commons are to “disagree with Lords amendments”. Unfortunately, the Conservative MPs outnumber the opposition MPs in the Commons, and we lose every vote, unless enough Conservative MPs rebel against their own Party so as to cancel out their majority. This did not happen in this case, and the opposition’s support for the Lords amendments was defeated at every vote. Amendment (a) was not a Lord’s amendment and was moved by a Conservative MP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lords amendments</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment (a) which would specify and exempt consensual communication, silent prayer, and peaceful presence from criminalisation, was opposed by MPs from across the House because nothing in Lords amendment 5 (restricting protests to within 150 metres of an abortion clinic, known as a buffer zone) would criminalise prayer, and is clear that there is a time and place for everything, whereas amendment (a) creates confusion for the police who will have to enforce buffer zones. Amendment (a) was lost 116-299.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment 6 removes clause 11 which gives the police power to stop and search suspicion-less protest related items, such as a person or vehicle. The vote was lost by 236-281 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment 1 provides a definition of “serious disruption” on the face of the Bill, because the UK Government are trying to lower the threshold. The definition is – causing significant harm to persons/organisations/life of community. The vote was lost 235-286.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Government amendment (a) to Lords amendment 1 is an attempt to raise the threshold somewhat but is still unacceptable, so it was pushed to a vote, which was lost 231-285.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment 20 removes clause 20, introducing serious disruption orders other than on conviction, which means that an order made by a magistrate court on application from a chief officer of the police on application not at the point of conviction, from the Bill. The vote was lost 232-280.</p>

    <title>Weekly Round-Up :: 17 March 2023</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/03/17/weekly-round-up-17-march-2023/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-17-march-2023" type="text/html"/>

<p>The tradition of Budget week has continued for another year. We start off with a Budget being announced on the Wednesday and headlines running it’s delivered a land of milk and honey. Then people delve into the small print and see just how bad things actually are. The Chancellor said we will avoid a recession… technically. Alarms bells started to ring as soon as I heard that. What we’ve since learnt is the independent Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) has revealed the economy will bump along the bottom and we will still lag behind comparable countries. 13 years of Tory Government has utterly failed us.</p>
<p>The Tories completely lack ambition for the country, but they particularly lack ambition for young people. There was nothing in this Budget for young people, particularly on housing help. There was a failure to reform the apprentice levy as promised, and they are still not doing enough for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The apprenticeship levy is a massive failure. New apprenticeship starts are falling backwards; the cohort is made up mainly of people in senior positions; and only 13% of degree-level apprentices come from neighbourhoods in the bottom fifth of deprivation, with twice as many coming from the most advantaged backgrounds. That is not good enough. Apprenticeships are a fantastic way to improve social mobility in this country and to show young people from disadvantaged areas that they have the capacity to improve their situation for themselves and their families and that they are able to contribute to society while doing this. This Government are putting far too many hurdles in front of our young people and leaving too many to fall behind their peers. I saw during my recent Apprenticeships Fair the vast appetite that there is for support for apprenticeships among both young people and employers. They all see the value in supporting young people into traineeships that allow them to earn money while they learn their skills and know how important they become to employers and companies. </p>
<p>The Government have broken their promise to fix social care. The stark reality is that more than 150,000 people have died waiting for state social care, and 57,000 people would have received support and they now will not. The Chancellor has promised far less funding for adult social care than he recommended when he was Chair of the Health and Social Care Committee. At the weekend, I was pleased to join the Bristol Women’s Commission at its event on the caring economy and how it can add to our productivity. We looked at the infrastructure for carers, improving working conditions, and pay and skills for low-paid care workers. That is what this Government need to be doing. I commend the work of the BWC. Support for and investment in social care does not have isolated benefits: it is desperately needed to support the NHS and ensure that those in hospital are those who need to be and not those who have nowhere else to go, it offers good work to hard-working people within their communities (although it desperately needs funding to improve wages), and it can lower the levels of loneliness that too many people experience in our sometimes-disjointed communities. </p>
<p>Overall, there is nothing in the Budget for the west and the south-west. Again, we have been completely ignored by this Government. Transport is a crucial issue for us in Bristol South. We can support tackling the climate crisis and moving towards net zero only if we have a functioning transport system, and this Government simply do not care about that. Many of my constituents rely on buses; the elderly and young people going to education need a bus service. With the end of the bus recovery grant, my constituents would like to know what on earth the Government are going to do to support them. It looks as though the only mention of the west country in the Red Book is in the section about Devon, which says we are going to get some money to deal with potholes. That is literally the only mention of the west and the south-west that I can find in this entire Budget. If that is the best that that wall of Tory MPs across the west country can come up with, I look forward to them disappearing. Much more could have happened on this, as we are a good, functioning economy. The Red Book has 116 pages, but there is nothing in it for Swindon, Bristol, Filton, Plymouth, Stroud, Truro or Falmouth. It is a complete waste of our time for the south-west, and the sooner the Tories go, the better.</p>
<p>Back in Bristol, I was pleased to have meetings with Doug Claringbold, Managing Director of First Bus, and some GPs and Practice Managers from south Bristol about the various challenges they face in providing services locally. Many of the issues faced need to be resolved at a national level and I am always grateful to those in the front-line sharing experiences and ideas with me. </p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Philip Dunne MP for South Shropshire welcomed new funding to support local leisure centres with swimming pools. The Government confirmed in today's Budget £63 million of funding to help publicly owned leisure centres with swimming pools through the financial pressures they face from high energy costs this year.</p>

<p>The fund will be managed by Sport England and will allow local authorities to apply for funding for leisure centres with pools that face immediate cost pressures including operational and maintenance costs, especially energy bills.</p>

<p>The fund aims to help these facilities become more energy efficient, with £40 million of the fund made available for investment in decarbonisation and long-term energy efficiency, while £23 million will help with costs to make these essential local hubs more energy efficient. Council-run pools, pools run on behalf of councils by private companies and by charities are all eligible for support.</p>

<p>Philip Dunne MP for South Shropshire said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I welcome this financial life saver from the Government to support local leisure centres with swimming pools, who have been very concerned that they might not be able to afford to open this summer.</p>

<p>“Our public pools here in South Shropshire play a vital role in help young and old keep fit and have fun, especially as we move into Spring and Summer months.</p>

<p>“I shall work with Shropshire Council and our leisure centre operators to ensure they engage with Sport England to secure whatever support is available."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>More information on how local authorities can apply for funding and detailed eligibility criteria will be made available in due course.</strong></p></div>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<h1>Budget Special Newsletter:</h1>



<p>Earlier this week I was in the House of Commons to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Spring Budget. You can watch my speech in response&nbsp;<a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/9a2782e4-5f86-4a9d-8dcd-b6767b517c25?in=17:31:37">here</a>. Following the financial turmoil last Autumn this wasn’t expected to be a dramatic budget, but the improving position of the economy enabled the Chancellor to make some significant announcements.</p>



<p>The good economic news was that we are no longer forecast to enter recession this year and inflation is forecast to be below 3% by Christmas, a significant reduction on the current position of over 10% and a sign that the tough measures taken to stabilise the economy are working.</p>



<p>I welcome the focus of the Spring Budget on the everyday costs of average working families and support for services and businesses which are central to our communities. I am also pleased that much of this support will be going towards families and individuals here in Amber Valley, saving them money on their bills, fuel prices, childcare and allowing them to benefit from broader economic investment and growth.</p>



<p>The main announcements were:</p>



<h2>Extending Energy Bills Support:</h2>



<p>The Energy Price Guarantee, which has capped energy bills for households across the UK at an average of £2,500 a year will be extended for 3 months to the end of June 2023 saving the average household £160. Bills are forecast to fall below this level from July. In my speech following the Budget I urged the Chancellor to extend this to next March in the event prices don’t fall as expected so we all have certainty over what we will pay next winter.</p>



<p>Additionally, houses on prepayments meters are set to see an even greater benefit, as the Government is ending Prepayment Meter premium, ensuring that the prices these customers pay are in line with those on direct debit schemes. Forced prepayment meter installations are also suspended, ensuring those struggling to pay are not being taken advantage of by energy companies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056786.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Fuel Duty frozen:</h2>



<p>The freeze on Fuel Duty is also set to be extended for 2023, cancelling the planned 11p rise. The Government will also be maintaining the 5p cut on fuel duty for a further 12 months. While prices have fallen back from the peak, they are still high and freezing the duty will save motorists up to £200 this year. I know this will be welcomed by all those of you who have recently written to me in favour of keeping fuel duty frozen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056811.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Making childcare more affordable:</h2>



<p>I know only too well how large a burden the cost of childcare for under 3s is, in many cases making working impossible. Parents also have challenges in Amber Valley finding places.</p>



<p>The Spring Budget includes a number of reforms to reduce childcare costs for working families, allowing parents to return to work should they wish. Free childcare is being extended to young families with children between 9 months and 3 years (from when 30 hours free is currently provided). Families where all adults work over 16 hours a week will be entitled to up to 30 hours of free childcare – this is being phased in from next Spring to ensure sufficient spaces are available.</p>



<p>For those on Universal Credit who wish to return to work, we are increasing the maximum claim limits up to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children and allowing parents to be paid upfront rather than having to pay the cost themselves first.</p>



<p>In order to boost the number of childminders and increase the provision of childcare services, the Government is introducing an incentive of £600 for new child-minders and up to £1200 for those who join the profession through an agency. An additional £204 million is also being provided to fund nurseries which are offering free childcare hours.</p>



<p>And finally, we are increasing funding so primary schools can provide wrap around childcare between 8am and 6pm.</p>



<p>I welcome this support being given to young working families and am pleased that these policies have been introduced following recommendations by myself and my colleagues on the Work and Pensions Select Committee in a recent report.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056839.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Supporting our pubs:</h2>



<p>Pubs in Amber Valley will also benefit from the Budget, helping these establishments continue to play an important role in our town centres and our communities. While the new Alcohol Duty rates will be introduced for alcoholic drinks in supermarkets in August, pubs will be able to keep their prices down due to Draught Relief being raised from 5% to 9.2%.</p>



<p>This means that the price of an average draught pint of beer served in a pub will not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than in supermarkets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056856.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Fixing potholes in Derbyshire:</h2>



<p>Many residents of Amber Valley will also be pleased to hear that there will be an expansion of the funding being assigned to fix potholes. The Government is allocating an additional £200 million to fix potholes, which is the equivalent of 4 million potholes being fixed across the UK. Derbyshire’s share of this is £4.2m.</p>



<p>If you know of any potholes that need fixing, please send me an email via my Street Watch reporting below and we’ll report them to the Council.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056873.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Supporting leisure centres &amp; keeping pools warm:</h2>



<p>We are lucky enough to have 3 leisure centres here in Amber Valley, and I welcome the support being given to help them keep their heating costs down and continue to provide fun healthy activities and spaces for everyone in Amber Valley. The Government has announced it is allocated £63 million to a support fund for leisure centres to access, in order to help them keep our pools warm and pay their energy bills.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056891.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Universal Support Scheme:</h2>



<p>I am pleased that reforms are being introduced to separate benefits entitlement from ability to work for those on disability support. Too long this has stopped those on disability benefits from working, for fear of losing financial support. The Government wants to help those who wish to work but are held back by their disability. To do this they are providing Universal Support up to £4000 per person to help these individuals find jobs and make the necessary adjustments to allow them to enter the workforce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056905.jpg" alt=""/></figure>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has backed calls for the Government to do more to tackle cat theft, and has urged Greater Manchester Police to resume its data collections on the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat theft is on the rise, with a 40% uptick in thefts since 2021. Despite over 560 cases of cat thefts being reported over the year, just two resulted in prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Gwynne joined representatives form Battersea, Cats Protection and the Blue Cross to discuss the issue at a Parliamentary reception. There, Gwynne was told that Greater Manchester Police have stopped recording cat thefts as a specific offence, making it harder to track the prevalence of the problem. Gwynne has pledged to write to GMP to raise the issue, and to request that they resume data collection for the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwynne has also called on the Government to bring back its Kept Animals Bill. The Bill, which included a number of new protections for domestic pets, has been long-promised by the Government but has not returned to Parliament since its last reading in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As an animal lover with two beloved moggies of my own, I can only imagine how traumatic it must be to have a pet stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a horrible crime, and we need to get tough about tackling it. That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ll be writing to GMP to request that they properly record cat thefts, and continue to put pressure on the Government to bring back its Kept Animals Bill and give our domestic pets the protection they deserve.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I wrote this column before the Chancellor’s speech but, thanks to pre-budget leaks, the content is hardly a state secret. He has more money to play with than anticipated and is likely to target areas where opinion polls show Labour taking a lead. </p>



<p>He’ll relax staff/child ratios for nurseries. It’s been done in Scotland with no ill-effect and should work here, but it’s unlikely to reduce costs. He plans to increase Universal Credit childcare allowances which will help those trying to re-enter the job market, but only if he allows upfront rather than retrospective payments which have caused many working mums to lose places and then their job. </p>



<p>What about working couples who don’t qualify for Universal Credit? There’s precious little for them. A freeze on fuel duty and energy prices is the least he can do and measures to encourage people over age 50 to remain in work are useful but will mostly benefit those with large pension pots. It will help doctor retention but do little for those over 50s with smaller incomes.</p>



<p>Jeremy Hunt has history. He presided over problems affecting the NHS and then, as Chair of the Health Select Committee, argued for remedial action. His budget ignores the impact of years of wage restraint. Even the Institute for Fiscal Studies, hardly a left-leaning body, casts doubt on his arguments regarding public sector pay.</p>



<p>There’s more scope than this budget recognises. Improvements in public finances make it easier to deliver a fair public pay settlement. If the Chancellor, unlike his predecessor, is worried about the bills, he could always opt for fairer taxation. Tax on ordinary families is rising but taxation in the UK is still below the OECD average and unfairly distributed. The LSE/Warwick University study says that equalising Capital Gains Tax and Income Tax would raise £15.6 billion. Abolishing non-dom status, already Labour policy, would raise £3.6 billion and extending National Insurance to investment income (e.g., rental income) would raise £9.6 billion.</p>



<p>This is the budget of a tired man who lacks the vision and imagination to address the problems caused by 13 years of Tory failure.</p>

    <title>A budget of managed decline</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/03/16/a-budget-of-managed-decline/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt has announced a new budget today. Once again it is a budget devoid of real ideas, a budget that will not provide the support needed for the people of Nottingham. It will not stop the cost of living crisis and barely even shields the most vulnerable from the damages the crisis is causing. In truth it will not do anything to pull Britain out of the prolonged decline we have found ourselves in after 13 years of costly and divisive Tory government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK pays some of the highest energy bills in Europe and the OBR confirmed that the UK will be the weakest economy in the G7 this year, the only country that will see negative growth. Our economy has stagnated, it is still smaller than it was on the eve of the pandemic in 2019. It’s not just growth that has stagnated, wages have stagnated for nearly a decade, especially in the public sector, while costs are continually increasing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average French family is now a tenth richer than their British counterparts, whilst the average German family is a fifth richer. Public services have been beset by strikes as the key workers who kept us going through Covid fight for their wages to get somewhere in reach of meeting the cost of living. Real weekly wages are expected to remain below 2008 levels until 2026 &amp;#8211; no wonder so many strike. The government is either completely unable to play its role helping settlements be reached, or it is being wilfully obstructive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We welcome the news that Jeremy Hunt was backed into continuing the guarantee on energy bills, but this is not enough. Energy companies are making obscene profits and the average person still pays more than those in Europe &amp;#8211; and they still pay more than they can afford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also welcome the Chancellor accepting that, as Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has made clear in Labour’s announcements late last year, that childcare is critical infrastructure that both families and economies need. The question that remains hanging though is whether there is anything planned to deliver this, or as one of the sector voices raised this morning, it is just a slogan with an eye on an election. The fact that the 30 hours will not come in until at least September 2025 is unacceptable though &amp;#8211; families will struggle until then and many expel will be forced out of the workplace. If it is needed then it is needed now in the midst of the cost of living crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is not welcome is another Tory policy aimed at the wealthiest in society. A £1 billion tax cut for the richest 1% of earners via changes to pension allowances.A high earner with a £2 million pension pot will get a tax cut of £275k when they take their tax free lump sum. And even if it is as successful as the chancellor hopes in keeping high earners in the workplace, the measure will cost the taxpayer £70k for every person returned to the labour market. Even worse it appears as though it will become another loophole for the wealthiest to avoid inheritance tax.&lt;br&gt;Across Nottingham and the country people are having to make the decision to heat or eat. This should not be happening in a country like the United Kingdom &amp;#8211; it is an indictment of the failures of the Tory government.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017-200x300.jpg" alt="Adele Williams deputy leader headshot portrait" class="wp-image-2986" width="150" height="225" srcset="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017-200x300.jpg 200w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Councillor Adele Williams Deputy Leader and portfolio holder for finance &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cllr Adele Williams, Deputy Leader and Portfolio Holder for Finance reacts:&lt;br&gt;‘While the Tory government seems to do as little as it can to help people in this city and beyond, Nottingham Labour has prioritised council resources to address the cost of living crisis. Our internal welfare rights team in partnership with the network of council supported advice services in communities offers help and advice to maximise income and manage debt. We are also working in our partnerships to promote buying locally and supporting good local employment so that the Nottingham pound recirculates around our city, filling cupboards here rather than offshore coffers. Our CN28 plans for carbon neutrality also come with benefits to the back pockets of Nottingham, whether in reduced heating bills from insulation or our affordable and accessible integrated transport system that means you don’t need a car to get around and get on in our city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with a government that has presided over a historic decline in the standard of living, with the fall in disposable income for the next two years being the worst since records began in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our NHS, pride of our nation, is in tragic, unforgivable decline. Tories have never backed it, and have never understood the links between declining wealth and ill health. You can’t have a high growth economy with 7 million of us waiting for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Tories think we deserve no better and they don’t understand that a low wage exploitative economy won’t produce growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was nothing in the budget to boost growth, nothing to address the massive shortages of staff that are afflicting our public services – including childcare – and nothing to close the gap in household budgets, only a commitment to freeze bills as huge as they they already are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Conservatives have no policy ideas, no moral compass and no mandate for their third Prime Minister. They should step aside. Labour is ready to build Britain back up from this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes a £230m investment in council housing to improve existing properties, build hundreds of new council houses and make hard-to-heat homes more sustainable and energy-efficient. Although this includes funding to build more houses, it is also funding to improve insulation in existing properties and provide solar panels, helping to improve energy efficiency and cut families heating bills.&lt;br&gt;Our Welfare rights team also provide debt and financial advice to city residents, helping them balance their household budgets, and filling in the education gap to help residents help themselves in a way the government have sadly failed.&lt;br&gt;Nottingham Labour also supports partners in the city, supporting food banks and providing free fun and food events in the city for our low-income residents. We are working with our partners to promote local good employment, and buying locally so the Nottingham pound fills cupboards in Nottingham not offshore coffers.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central plank of the budget was to extend 30 hours of childcare a week for working parents of children from 9 months to 4 years of age. At the same time there will also be additional support for people receiving Universal Credit who will benefit from having support for upfront childcare costs. These two specific measures will help remove barriers to work for large numbers of parents and will give the economy a large injection of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleased that we are giving householders greater certainty on their energy bills by extending the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for a further 3 months. For the thirteenth year in a row there will be another freeze in fuel duty, a campaign I recently supported. This will save families money at the pumps and combined with more money for Walsall Council to fill potholes this will be welcomed by all motorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor’s decision to give £30 million to support our veterans helps honour our commitment to those who have served on behalf of our country. An additional £10 million to the third sector to help address suicide support alongside a further £100 million to support local charities and organisations are all measures to be applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the budget was a new landmark devolution deal which will deliver the West Midlands under the stewardship of Mayor Andy Street significant new powers and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new deal will offer £500 million extra for housing. Importantly for residents across Aldridge-Brownhills it also gives greater flexibility to undertake brownfield regeneration as well new powers to deliver affordable housing allowing us to get the right homes in the right places and protect our precious Green Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further funding commitment for transport infrastructure will hopefully keep our ambition for a station with Aldridge on track. Additional financial powers allowing the retention of business rates for the next 10 years will give the region an estimated further £45 million a year of economic fire power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal also offers the West Midlands further influence over key policy areas such as skills, careers, employment support and digital inclusion. This represents a major step forward for the West Midlands in allowing more freedom and flexibility to support people into work, attain better skills and improve our quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Government we remain focused on our key priority to drive greater levels of growth throughout the British economy and today we remain steadfast in delivering a plan for growth for the benefit of all the hard working families across Aldridge-Brownhills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em><strong>This article was written by John for AltFi, a leading magazine on alternative finance and fintech</strong></em></p>



<p>At the start of the year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt gave his first big speech about how he’s going to get Britain growing faster. </p>



<p>It was his first chance to present a vision for the future and to highlight the strengths of the UK economy, especially in areas like digital technology, AI, fintech, life sciences and green energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, there is an immediate, urgent priority to bring down inflation, but growth is a long-term essential too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with the Government’s finances under huge strain after a pandemic and an energy crisis in quick succession, he won’t have much scope in his upcoming budget to get things moving by turning on the taps of Government spending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with much less fiscal firepower than usual, supply-side reforms to unblock the arteries of our economy will be his main option for faster growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, in 2021, I published a Government-commissioned report which has loads of precisely these types of ideas, so he will have plenty of options to choose from. It was called&nbsp;<em>Power To The People</em>&nbsp;and made about 30 recommendations on how to make Britain more internationally cutting-edge and competitive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just recently I’ve published an update called Unfinished Revolution which works out which of the original 30 ideas are still waiting to be done (the answer is ‘about half’) and adds a few new ones to reflect what’s changed because of the pandemic and war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest and most profound economic disruption is digitisation. Yes, there are obvious benefits as things become faster, cheaper and more convenient, but there are downsides too. We’ve got to work out how to handle huge new digital data monopolies and deal with the question of whether consumers and businesses understand the value of their data too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last time we updated our competition rules, firms like Amazon, Uber and Apple didn’t exist, so it’s good news that Government Ministers are planning to deal with the digital monopolies through a specialist unit in the Competition and Markets Authority too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the single most valuable and important change ought to be something called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.altfi.com/companies/smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart&nbsp;</a>Data, which could be a game changer if we handle it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.altfi.com/companies/smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart&nbsp;</a>Data is about putting consumers and businesses directly in charge of their own data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of it like this, the Government, banks, supermarkets, energy providers and pretty much any company or organisation we deal with day-to-day sit on lots of data about what we buy, how much we earn or where we like to travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.altfi.com/companies/smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart&nbsp;</a>Data is about giving each of us the right to make our information portable.</p>



<p>A good example is open banking, a proven British success story that is helping millions of small businesses and consumers by transforming the way we pay for things, how we apply for credit and keeping on top of our finances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has helped turbocharge our fintech industry even more. But why shouldn’t it be extended beyond banking and into “open everything” by including insurance, pensions, energy or online shopping too?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key to all of this is a new piece of legislation, the upcoming Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. It’s a promising start, but it’s tentative: it won’t get us to open everything, because it doesn’t go far or fast enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other countries aren’t standing still either. They’ve seen the phenomenal success of open banking and, unsurprisingly, they’d like some of what we’ve got too. If we don’t get a move on, they won’t just copy what we’ve done already; they’ll leapfrog and overtake us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have an opportunity to use this as a mechanism to make us more ambitious and move from open banking to ‘open everything’ as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we do, it will maintain our global leadership, create thousands more valuable, world-beating UK-based start-up firms and mean the industries and skills of the future would be created right here.</p>



<p>When the Chancellor stands up to deliver his Spring Budget in Parliament next month, I’m sure he will be proud of the innovation in new and high-tech sectors of our economy. ‘Open Everything’ can and should be one of them.</p>

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-11/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with a further update about a number of local matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epsom &amp;amp; Ewell Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a reminder about the deadline for the consultation on the local plan for Epsom and Ewell Borough. You have until March 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to take part in the consultation and to give your view about what is proposed. It is really important that everyone takes part, as the plan is highly controversial and involves developing a large area of green belt land in Epsom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan includes building 1500 homes on the Horton Farm site, the area of farmland between Horton Lane and Hook Road, building residential blocks on the playing fields next to Ewell East station and building homes on part of the Hook Road arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have submitted a response which continues to argue for the redevelopment of the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas as a mixed use area. This could provide more homes than the Council’s plans for local green belt. Contrary to what some of you may have heard, the outline plan also envisages retaining the same amount of commercial space as at present. All the details are on my website &lt;a href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/shaping-the-right-plan-for-epsom-and-ewell-a-proposal-from-chris-grayling/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also going to be a special Council meeting about the plan on &lt;strong&gt;March 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Although I imagine that the public gallery will be packed, you will also be able to watch the meeting online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of how to respond to the consultation are at &lt;a href="http://www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk"&gt;www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; . Information about how to log in and watch the Council meeting will be on the website at this address a few days before the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://democracy.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=146&amp;amp;MId=1462&amp;amp;Ver=4"&gt;https://democracy.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=146&amp;amp;MId=1462&amp;amp;Ver=4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mole Valley Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who live in Mole Valley, the latest on its local plan is that the process has been paused to wait for the revised national policy on green belt land. I spoke at the planning enquiry and asked for a reduction to the amount of green belt land proposed for development in Ashtead. I hope that when the new policy is launched the plan will be modified accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ewell East Train Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people have been in touch with me about the reduction in train services at Ewell East. I have been pursuing this with Southern, and they have agreed to restore the half hourly service at peak times. This will mean six additional trains stopping at Ewell East when the new timetable starts in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are still issues around crowding on the Waterloo line and I am continuing to push on this. The arrival of the new ten coach trains, which is due this year, will I hope make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horton &amp;#8211; Local Centre Parking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of people have raised concerns with me about the way that the car park is being operated at the Horton local centre, with complaints about the way that people are being penalised for visiting the shops. I have raised concerns with the owners of the site, and they have agreed to improve the signage so that it is much clearer which spaces are available for shoppers. I would still advise taking care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Veterans Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a former member of the armed forces, I have been asked to let you know that there is an active and growing veterans group locally. It organises a range of activities for veterans, and all are welcome to join. If you are interested please contact Barb Warwich of the local branch of the British Legion, &lt;a href="mailto:barb.warwick@virginmedia.com"&gt;barb.warwick@virginmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Age Concern Volunteers Needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been asked by the local Age Concern team to let you know that they are in need of both volunteer drivers, and also people who are interested in joining their Trustee board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers are needed to take older people from the Borough of Epsom and Ewell to medical appointments, or to visit family of friends in hospital or residential homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a regular weekly commitment or on an ad-hoc basis.  A mileage allowance of 50p per mile is paid and they will need to undertake a DBS clearance for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role is of interest or if you would like more information, please contact Jane Hodgson, Volunteer Co-ordinator on 01372 728458 or by email &lt;a href="mailto:jane.hodgson@ageconcernepsom.org.uk"&gt;jane.hodgson@ageconcernepsom.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Trustee Roles they would particularly like to hear from you if you have a background in law, business strategy, marketing, fundraising, or social care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, please send a copy of your current CV along with a covering letter detailing your skills, experience and motivation for applying to Dorah May Hancock, Chief Officer, Age Concern Epsom and Ewell by email to &lt;a href="mailto:dorahmay.hancock@ageconcernepsom.org.uk"&gt;dorahmay.hancock@ageconcernepsom.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; or contact her on 01372 732458 for an informal discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inspiring International Women’s Day Event</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/inspiring-international-womens-day-event/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=inspiring-international-womens-day-event" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last week, I was privileged to chair a constituency event to mark International Women&amp;#8217;s Day. A packed auditorium of young girls listened attentively to the talented and inspiring women on the panel, all of whom kindly took time out of their busy lives to share their stories of success and, sometimes, struggle, competing in male-dominated professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;International Women&amp;#8217;s Day (IWD) is celebrated annually on 8 March as a global day focussing on the women&amp;#8217;s rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women. This year my team and I decided to use our platform to host a panel of inspiring local women for young girls to hear about their career journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that median hourly pay for full-time employees was 8.3% less for women than for men in April 2022. According to the World Economic Forum, it will take 268 years to close the economic gender gap – clearly, we have a long way to go, making events like these as important as ever. Young people, especially girls, can find themselves under pressure in the judgemental world of social media on top of the challenge of finding their way in the world of work, often steered towards a lower-paid career. Seeing the young folk in the room inspired by the incredible women on the panel was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Former RAF Nimrod pilot, Kirsty Harding, talked of motherhood &amp;#8211; whilst serving in an active war zone. Freda Newton, who is not only a hugely successful business woman but also a well-respected thought leader in the tourism sector, kindly shared her experiences of building successful businesses and spoke of the trial of surviving a pandemic immediately after a massive investment in her company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Clare Humphrey, founder of Will to Win, gave the perspective of a life coach, while Danielle Nicolson talked candidly about women and politics. Libby Macdonald, an advocate for fair work in social care and real living wage campaigner, spoke of her experiences in the care sector. Cecilia Grigor gave her insights on building a business in the digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I want to thank them for sharing their stories to inspire the young audience. After the event, there were many requests to take selfies and follow-up chats, which clearly showed their impact on the young audience. It was rewarding to see inspiring women, inspiring a whole generation of inspiring women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I also recently held cost-of-living surgeries across the constituency, including in Aviemore. I was grateful to the organisations who joined me at these events to help local folk struggling to make ends meet. If you need help, my team and I are always here to listen and help. You can book a meeting, a call or email me on my website at &lt;a href="http://www.drewhendrymp.scot"&gt;www.drewhendrymp.scot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before I finish, I want to give you a quick update on my It&amp;#8217;s Your Money campaign calling on energy suppliers to treat people fairly, especially to stop hoarding customers&amp;#8217; credit balances. Since raising this issue, many people have been in touch to tell me that they have discovered they are in credit, sometimes with sums over £1000. Digging further into this unfairness has exposed a litany of failures and suspect practices. Rest assured, I will continue to press for fair treatment for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;

    <title>Put an end to postcode lottery for bone health, demands Judith</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/put-an-end-to-postcode-lottery-for-bone-health-demands-judith-cummins-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cummins MP on Tuesday called for the government to step up and provide 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services in England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a long-term health condition characterised by weak bones prone to breaking or fracture. It affects 3.5m people across the UK: a fifth of men and half of women over 50.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A report by the Royal Osteoporosis Society found that 90,000 people miss out on the treatment every year and some 2.2 million people in the UK are left with undiagnosed spinal fractures. Fracture Liaison Services&amp;nbsp;are an essential means of identifying and treating osteoporosis early. Yet, only 57% of people in England have access to this quality of life improving service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the Chamber, Judith called on the government to provide the necessary services, which could prevent over thirty thousand hip fractures by identifying bone problems early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An investment of just £27 million per year in Fracture Liaison Services would deliver over £600 million in savings over five years for the NHS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Will the Minister meet with me and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, to discuss our report, and commit to ending the postcode lottery by providing 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services for over-50s in England?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Secretary of State for Health Steve Barclay MP agreed: “Obviously, she sets out a very compelling case in terms of the return on investment. Clearly, we will need to scrutinise that in more detail.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_03_07-FLS-ROS-Health-Q.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Judith hears from the Health Secretary there is a &amp;#8216;compelling case&amp;#8217; for investing in FLS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith emphasized the need to act now to ensure that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and people are not unnecessarily left in pain with debilitating fractures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bradford has an exemplary fracture liaison service, but almost half of the country must do without. When these early opportunities to prevent fractures are missed there is a greater pressure on ambulances, acute hospital bed days, and greater stress on the NHS.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By acting now to provide full Fracture Liaison Services coverage right across England, we can save people unnecessary pain, save the NHS vital resources, and give all patients the level of care they deserve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Llanelli Star Column – How Pension Credit can be a welcome boost</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://niagriffith.org.uk/2023/02/llanelli-star-column-how-pension-credit-can-be-a-welcome-boost/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Many pensioners across Carmarthenshire may be losing out on vital Pension Credit help that could bring an average of £2,700 extra into their homes every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated
£5million worth of Pension Credit annually goes unclaimed in the county which
during this cost of living crisis could be used by local people to help make
ends meet.&amp;nbsp; It is a nationwide problem
too with one million households thought to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pension Credit
provides extra cash to those who are over State Pension age and on low incomes.&amp;nbsp; It is separate from the State Pension and you
might be able to qualify even if you have other income, savings or if you’re a
homeowner.&amp;nbsp; It can also act as a
“gateway” benefit which opens doors to additional help with housing costs,
council tax, TV licences and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is the most
underclaimed benefit of all and around a quarter of those eligible to claim do
not do so, missing out on support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I’m
determined to encourage as many local residents who think they might qualify to
apply.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently held
an event at the Selwyn Samuel Centre to raise awareness of Pension Credit which
attracted over 150 people, with experts from the Citizens Advice Bureau, DWP
and other organisations on hand to help.&amp;nbsp;
Anyone who thinks that they, or a loved one, may be eligible for Pension
Credit should find out more about it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claims can be
made online at &lt;a href="http://www.gov.uk/pension"&gt;www.gov.uk/pension&lt;/a&gt; credit or by phone on 0800 99 1234. &amp;nbsp;If you need help in submitting a claim then my
office is happy to assist and can put you in contact with a specialist advisor to
take you through the process.&amp;nbsp; Please get
in touch on 01554 756374 or email &lt;a href="mailto:nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk"&gt;nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Welcoming the announcement, MP for Boston and Skegness Matt Warman said:</p>
<p>“This £8.76 million Shared Prosperity funding to Boston and East Lindsey comes on top of the £70.3 million Town Deals and £22.8 million in Levelling Up Funding and shows the Government’s commitment to Levelling Up Boston, East Lindsey and Lincolnshire as a whole. It represents a huge vote of confidence in the vision for regeneration and growth put forward by Boston and East Lindsey Councils and the Town Deal boards.</p>
<p>“The request for expressions of interest for projects meeting the three priorities of this latest fund is a great opportunity for even more local organisations to join in driving innovation, growth and community in our area.'”</p>
<p>The full bidding guide for the funding and the expression of interest form is available on the Council’s website at <a href="http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF">http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF</a> and <a href="http://www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF">www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF</a>.</p>

    <title>Our Letter to the Prime Minister on Fulfilling Dementia Commitments</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">We Demand that the Government <span style="color:#06396a;">Fulfils its Commitments on Dementia</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Today I joined Alzheimer’s Society Ambassadors Vicky McClure and Dame Arlene Phillips as well as Elliot Colburn MP and Ananga Moonesinghe, who lives with dementia, to deliver an open letter to PM Rishi Sunak at Downing Street, demanding the Government urgently fulfil their promises on dementia.</p>
<p>Launched by leading dementia charity Alzheimer’s Society, the open letter has been signed by over 36,000 members of the public and famous names including Choreographer Dame Arlene Philips and actor Vicky McClure. We were joined at the hand-in by my colleague on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, Vice-Chair Elliot Colburn MP, showing cross-party support. It urges Rishi Sunak to deliver on previous Conservative Party commitments to dementia and not let the UK’s biggest killer fall down the political agenda.</p>
<p>Previous Conservative Prime Ministers have actively committed to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. Now Rishi Sunak must deliver on promises to reform social care, double dementia research funding and release a ten-year plan for dementia which gives the condition the priority it deserves. The 36,000 people who signed the open letter are making themselves clear – they don’t just want to hear empty promises, they want to see action. People with dementia can’t and won’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates still sitting below pre-pandemic levels, national figures reveal people are waiting up to two years in some areas for a diagnosis, thereby missing out on vital treatment and support. Alzheimer’s Society research also shows three in five people affected by dementia struggled to get social care in the past year, with half of family carers revealing they ended up in crisis, such as rushing their loved one to A&amp;E due to lack of support</p>
<p>The charity is concerned the deepening workforce crisis in social care – with vacancies sitting at 165,000 – risks leaving people with dementia desperate for help while living costs soar. Alzheimer’s Society say it’s more important now than ever for the Government to prioritise dementia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Government has made many commitments on dementia, promising to deliver a ‘visionary ten-year plan’ for dementia, to reform the social care system and double spending on dementia research by 2024.  Alzheimer’s Society says the delivery of these will be transformational for the lives of the 900,000 people living with dementia but calls on the Government to urgently make these a reality to prevent a deepening crisis in dementia care.</p>
<p>This follows the news last year that a new drug, lecanemab, was shown to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this breakthrough will mean little if diagnosis rates remain stagnant and often inaccurate. This treatment works best for people with early Alzheimer’s disease. Without early and accurate diagnosis, we risk hopeful advancements like this having minimal effect.</p>

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
