      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My recent sessions on the doorsteps have been of particular interest. Despite the saturation coverage of the tragic war in Ukraine no-one has raised any Ukraine related issue with me in recent visits to Earley, Shinfield, Wokingham  and Winnersh. There have been some issues raised about the Spring Statement and what more the government could do to tackle the cost of living crisis. There have been no questions or suggestions about covid despite the large numbers of cases currently being reported. The occasional person has explained from a distance they are infectious and do not wish to pass it on.</p>
<p>Most of the conversations have been about local issues, often related to levels of development, traffic congestion, road closures and other Council matters. Emails and letters have broadly reflected the same pattern, with just three writing in on Ukrainian issues and many more on cost of living and energy matters.</p>

    <title>Science and tech can improve our lives: unleash British innovation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2022/04/science-and-tech-can-improve-our-lives-unleash-british-innovation/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick note on Science in the #SpringBudget &amp;#8211; lots of talk, no (constructive) action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chancellor backtracked on tax credits for overseas R&amp;amp;D. In Autumn budget, he said that govt would ‘refocus the reliefs towards #innovation in the UK’, now he plans to legislate so that overseas  R&amp;amp;D spend can still qualify for tax relief &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Autumn, overseas R&amp;amp;D spend was “unfair on British taxpayers” and out of step with other countries, what has changed since then? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps one reason might be the fact the government is lagging behind its (low) 2027 target of 2.4% of GDP spend on R&amp;amp;D. Sunak blamed the private sector, for “lagging significantly” in terms of their spending. What is he going to do to address this? He did not say. )&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key will be what he will do with R&amp;amp;D tax credits, but that is delayed to the autumn. It isn’t just about money though, the UK has problems across the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/innovation?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ecosystem, from Universities through to support for innovative start-ups. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indeed, a lot of the announcements on tax credits were re-announcements, the extension of R&amp;amp;D credits to cover cloud and data were announced last year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labour want to harness the power of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/science?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tech?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#tech&lt;/a&gt; to improve our lives, and unleash Britain’s innovation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Letter from Westminster – April 2022 – Ukraine</title>

    <div class="layout__region layout__region--content">
      
            <div class="field field--name-field-date field--type-datetime field--label-hidden field--item">1 April 2022</div>
      
      <div class="field field--name-field-page-builder field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field--items">
              <div class="field--item">  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default">
          
            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"><span>Letter from Westminster – April 2022 – Ukraine</span></div>
      
            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on 24th February (having previously invaded in 2014), it has been uplifting to see people around the world uniting to do whatever they can to help those affected by the conflict.</p>

<p>The UK is a particularly charitable country, and people in Shropshire always go above and beyond when it comes to helping those in need. We saw this in spades during the covid pandemic, where community groups and friendly neighbours helped each other cope. This was especially important for those of us who had to shield, or were not able to get out for basic supplies and prescriptions.</p>

<p>There is also always a strong response from local communities whenever disaster appeals are organised through the major charities, which are so active in Shropshire. But the reality of renewed war in Europe following the devastation wreaked on the innocent people of Ukraine by the monster that is President Putin and his Russian war machine, has awakened a tremendous public spirit to try to help.</p>

<p>Most of us thought war in Europe had been consigned to history. Hardly anyone under the age of 75 has had experience of war in Europe, aside from those who served or supported people in the Balkan conflicts, and following the fall of the Berlin Wall at the end of the Cold War we did not expect nations would invade democratic neighbours in Europe.</p>

<p>I have been deeply moved by the outpouring of warmth and desire to help people in Ukraine and refugees escaping from the horror. Many of our communities have held fund raising events, have donated money, medicine, food, and many others have collected clothing and other consumables, which are waiting for the all-clear where to send them. At the time of writing, the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal in response to the crisis in Ukraine has helped raise over £150m, of which the government is providing £25m of match funding as part of its £400m assistance to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The displacement of people from their homes has been horrific to see, made all the worse by President Putin’s decision to use indiscriminate destruction in Ukrainian cities, with innocent civilians paying the price.</p>

<p>Since the first days of this renewed conflict (it is important not to forget Russian aggression in Ukraine has been going on since 2014) I have called on the government to introduce a flexible approach to refugees, and to provide support to neighbouring countries, as the first point to which refugees will seek to flee.</p>

<p>Many constituents have offered to provide accommodation for refugees and their families, and I am pleased the government has put in place a specific Homes for Ukrainians Scheme, to allow anyone who can provide assistance to do so if they wish. I joined 100,000 others within the first day of the scheme opening to sign up to provide sponsorship. People arriving under this scheme will be able to live and work in the UK for up to three years, and will be able to access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education, and English language tuition.</p>

<p>The dire situation in Ukraine shows no sign of abating soon. I was in the House of Commons chamber last month when President Zelensky became the first non-Parliamentarian ever to give an address to the House of Commons. It was most moving. All MPs, Peers and journalists present stood united across party lines to show our support to him and the people of Ukraine in what they are going through to withstand this barbaric assault.</p>

<p>I stand foursquare behind the people and legitimate government of Ukraine, and the government has my full support for measures to ensure Putin fails in his policy of violent suppression of Ukraine.</p></div>

<p>In 2014, the school was rated ‘Inadequate’. However, following a dramatic transition and the hard work over several years of staff, including Head Teacher, Lee Williams, its latest Ofsted inspection report rated Lordswood Boys’ as ‘Good’.  </p>
<p>The report outlined that “pupils enjoy attending Lordswood Boys’ School and receive a good quality of education”. It also states that “All staff have a shared desire to improve the school and pupils understand that education can open up opportunities for them to become positive and productive members of society.” </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It is fantastic to see this incredible transformation. This Ofsted result is well-deserved following the work staff have put in to make this change a reality. It’s great to know that pupils attending Lordswood Boys’ will receive the best possible education and can be ambitious about what they want to achieve, knowing their teachers will support them. I would like to thank all the staff and teachers for putting in so much effort to make sure children in Edgbaston constituency receive the start in life they should be entitled to.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lee Williams, Headteacher at Lordswood Boys’ School said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We are delighted with the inspection outcome. The students and staff at Lordswood Boys' School are fully deserving of the praise and recognition within the report and it is our intention to continue our work in embedding and enhancing the educational opportunities. Lordswood Boys' School is now a school of choice; a school that the community can trust and rely on. I am immensely proud of our collective achievement.

    <title>Weekly Round-Up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/04/01/weekly-round-up-23/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-23" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started the week in the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee in a pre-appointment hearing for the chair of the UK Statistics Authority. The Government’s preferred candidate for the Chair of the UK Statistics Authority is Sir Robert Chote; this was a meeting to consider Sir Robert’s suitability against the job description and person specification while also acting as an added level of parliamentary scrutiny to verify his suitability for a public appointment. The UK Statistics Authority is an independent statutory body, operating at arm’s length from the Government as a non-ministerial department and reports directly to the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The work of the Authority is further defined under secondary legislation made under the Act by the UK Parliament or the devolved legislatures. The Authority aims to promote and safeguard the production and publication of official statistics that ‘serve the public good’. The independence of the UK Statistics Authority is vital, especially given the current Prime Minister’s approach to the truth and his persistent use of misleading statistics in Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday I contributed to the statement by the Education Secretary on the Schools White Paper. When he was interviewed on the weekend’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday”, the Secretary of State could not answer a question on the shocking fall in per pupil funding, particularly compared with private schools. My child, like thousands of children, started school just before this Government came into power and they are just about to finish. The Secretary of State talks about a parent pledge. I asked him to apologise to the thousands of parents and young people for what this Government has done to per pupil funding over the last 12 years. In his answer (that neglected such an apology), the Secretary of State talked about standards consistently going up. I don’t know where he’s been for the past 12 years that the Tories have been in power, but perhaps he should talk to some of the teachers in my constituency who are struggling to help students achieve their potential with ever fewer resources and are desperate to see the funding they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I spoke in the Health and Care Bill debate. I spent some six weeks on the Bill Committee trying to alter the original Bill. The list of improvements that have already been made is impressive. Unlike in the Committee, when the Minister batted away every single proposal for change, the Government has adopted some of our suggested changes and there has been some progress. I support the Lords Amendment intended to protect carers, to prevent any further problems with discharge to assess. We need to enhance people’s rights as carers, not take them away. I know from personal experience that the removal of an assessment prior to discharge may result in less priority being given to the assessment once someone has left hospital. Families clearly worry that patients may be “out of sight, out of mind” once they have left hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Committee, I raised many issues relating to the membership of integrated care boards, particularly in respect of their lack of accountability to local people. I was delighted to see one of my proposals go through the House of Lords. We are happy to support the approach agreed in Lords amendment 105, to give some positive recognition to parity of esteem for mental health. It is vital that there is a mental health voice on our integrated care boards so that consideration of equal level is given to our physical and mental care needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to meet with Brian Fisher of the Campaign for a National Care Support and Independent Living Service this week. Their aim is to get the market out of social care and make support free at the point of use, as with other aspects of our health care. They also want disabled and older people, families and communities to be able to shape what is needed to ensure that everyone has choice, dignity, and control over their care and their lives. Informal and unpaid carers deserve to be valued and their contribution recognised. Health care does not end at the hospital doors, and we need to ensure that our care system is accessible and inclusive.</span></p>

<p>Last Wednesday, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up to the despatch box in the House of Commons and delivered his ‘Spring Statement’. In essence a mini-budget, the Spring Statement was billed as being the means by which the Government would address the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p>The statistics are stark. Inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and is expected to continue rising. The energy price cap is due to be lifted in April, from £1,277 to £1,971. The Office for Budget Responsibilities (OBR) has forecasted that in 2022-2023 households will suffer their “biggest fall in living standards in any single financial year” since records began.</p>
<p>Behind every one of these statistics are ordinary working people struggling to make ends meet, families not being able to get food on the table, and individuals staring in disbelief at astronomic energy bills. I know that many people across Tameside would have been anxiously watching the Chancellor’s statement, waiting for some sort of action or support from the Government.</p>
<p>Instead, what they got was a paper-thin plan, that will result in families paying £3,000 more in tax. This – coupled with the biggest real terms cut to state pension in 50 years and the slashing of Universal Credit – will only exacerbate the extreme financial pressures that families are currently facing.</p>
<p>There were several measures that the Chancellor could have taken that would have eased the burden on families. He could have scrapped his tax rise on jobs, or introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to cut household goods. He could have brought forward a plan that would have supported British businesses whilst creating high-quality jobs.  He chose to do none of these things.</p>
<p>We cannot continue the path that the Chancellor has set us on. It is bad for families, bad for the economy and ultimately bad for the country. Here in Tameside, Council leaders are doing everything they can to support local people. However, without meaningful action from central Government, we will continue to face an uphill battle.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have now had 12 years in power, and in that time living standards have plummeted whilst cost-of-living has soared. We need a Government that understands the scale of the crisis that families across the country face and takes meaningful action to support those it represents.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I left the Chamber on Wednesday feeling distinctly like we had the wrong people for the job.</p>

    <title>Take a meter reading TODAY, urges Isles MP </title>

&lt;p&gt;Isles MP Angus MacNeil is urging households across the islands to take and submit energy meter readings TODAY ahead of the price rises from tomorrow (Friday).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a time when household budgets are already stretched due to rising fuel costs, Mr MacNeil says constituents should log meter readings with their energy firm, either online or by phone, to ensure they are not charged for energy usage before April 1st at the new rate based on estimates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ofgem will raise the price cap by 54% tomorrow (Friday).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “If you do not do a meter reading, then your energy firm will estimate what proportion of your usage was before April 1st and what proportion of usage was after that date. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage all households across the Western Isles to submit readings today to ensure you get the current cheaper rates for all the energy used up till April 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Last Sunday I was privileged to join the congregation and guests to celebrate the 40th anniversary of St Andrew&#8217;s Methodist Church in Cartland Road. It&#8217;s been there longer and in an earlier version was known as the corrugated chapel, essentially an old tin hut.</p>



<p>As I listened to long-standing members, I heard about ordinary people contributing and making a difference. They weren&#8217;t seeking acclaim for their actions, but were doing their bit by helping the community.</p>



<p>Today, the church is used by many social groups throughout the week and also happens to be the venue for meetings of my constituency Labour Party.</p>



<p>In his address, a former minister, Reverend Stuart Burgess, talked about his worries for the future.</p>



<p>As we emerge from this pandemic, there are difficult times ahead. There&#8217;s the loss of loved ones, unresolved grief from being unable to say last farewells or participate in proper funerals, the strain on mental health and developmental difficulties faced by young children during lockdown.</p>



<p>As we grapple with this, we also must contend with a cost-of-living crisis which is hitting people really hard.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a politician and look to politics and government to provide support but it&#8217;s not the only answer .</p>



<p>We need those of all faiths and none to come together and help the less fortunate. People need friendship. They need a helping hand; we cannot afford to cross on the other side.</p>



<p>Strong and caring communities create the lasting infrastructure which makes a difference. Yes, we need government intervention, and a council that cares and listens, but above all we need playgroups, lunch clubs, youth activities and help for single parents, the bereaved and the lonely.</p>



<p>St Andrew&#8217;s is a shining example of how a church can be so much more than just a place of worship. I believe we are in for some tough times but can weather the storm if we stick together.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just about buildings; its about people and our obligation&#8217;s to our neighbours, communities and each other.</p>

<p>Speaking during Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"Energy security is of vital significance, particularly at the moment, and nuclear is part of the clean energy mix.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the Minister understand that the United Kingdom, which has the second highest tidal range on planet Earth after Canada, is not making anything like sufficient use of that permanent tidal energy?</em></p>
<p><em>"Will he look again at his Government's policies on tidal, marine and hydro energy and give a boost not only to Cumbria and its energy coast but to the whole country?</em></p>
<p>In response, Energy Minister Lee Rowley said: <em>"The honourable gentleman raises an important point about the importance of a diversified and secure energy supply.</em></p>
<p><em>"This is one of the reasons that the Government are looking at all forms, including tidal, and it is why we would encourage people from across the House to agree not just with tidal but with nuclear as well."</em></p>

    <title>Judith continues to push for government action on quads menace</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/judith-continues-to-push-for-government-action-on-quads-menace/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Judith has again called for action to deal with anti-social quad use on our streets. Yesterday in Parliament, Judith called for a debate on government time to give the police the powers they need to seize and destroy nuisance quads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer MP, Judith said: “As this house will be aware, there is a growing menace of illegal and unlicensed quad bikes on our streets, and my recent ten-minute rule bill made provision for the police to seize and destroy these vehicles, for a registration scheme, make wearing of public helmets on public land compulsory, and also compel manufacturers of quad bikes to fit immobilisers to prevent theft. So, would the leader of the house agree with me that this problem needs to be tackled, and can we have a debate on government time on this issue?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Mark Spencer MP agreed that these vehicles can be a huge menace to communities, saying “They race up and down pathways and through gitties, they injure pedestrians and are a huge source of anti-social behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Spencer continued: “I urge the honourable lady to raise the matter with the Home Secretary … to ensure that the police have the full powers they need to continue to clamp down on anti-social behaviour”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This call comes after Judith’s recent ten-minute rule bill calling for more powers to help police deal with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith said: “I am continuing to push the government to tackle the menace of unlicensed quads on our streets”&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="x_MsoNormal">The Chancellor had a choice. He could have scrapped his unfair national insurance hike and introduced a windfall tax to bring down soaring energy bills, but instead, he chose to press ahead with his high tax, low growth policies. The Chancellor failed to rise to the scale of the challenge. Now the country faces the biggest fall in living standards since the 1950s, 1.3 million people are set to be pushed into poverty and 7 out of 8 working people will be clobbered with tax rises in the years ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-74/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My week began with the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-07/debates/97B249F2-C666-46EF-B46A-F2FF22DE2264/EconomicCrime(TransparencyAndEnforcement)Bill">Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill</a> and after a very long debate on the many amendments that had been tabled, only three amendments were pushed to a division. New Clause 2 was a cross-party amendment and was voted on at 9.39pm. It would require the Secretary of State to publish and lay before Parliament a report on the funding of enforcement agencies in connection with the reforms to “unexplained wealth orders”, as provided for in part 2 of the Bill. We lost 229-303. New Clause 7 was a Labour Front Bench amendment and was voted on at 9.54pm. It would require the Secretary of State to lay draft legislation on further Companies House reform (taken from the White Paper published on Monday) within 28 days of this proposal receiving Royal Assent. We lost 225-306. New Clause 29 was another cross-party amendment and was voted on at 10.08pm. It would empower the Secretary of State to publish the name of a person being considered as a “person for sanctions”, which immediately imposes on that person a duty not to sell any assets they own or in which they have an interest, or to move any of their assets or funds out of the UK, on pain of criminal liability (and risk of imprisonment). We lost 234-300.</p>
<p>Tuesday began with a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Restorative Justice (RJ) of which I’ve been vice-chair since its inception in April 2021. We discussed progress on the work streams that were set up directly from the recommendations contained in our inquiry report “<a href="https://restorativejustice.org.uk/blog/restorative-justice-appg-inquiry-report-published">Restorative Practices in 2021/22</a>” which sought to assess where the sector is and what steps could be taken to improve and co-ordinate the various services and improve outcomes for victims and offenders. The inquiry brought together over 50 leading practitioners and exponents of RJ, and there were over 200,000 submitted words of evidence. The APPG are hopeful that the UK Government will recognise the enormous benefits of RJ and roll out our recommendations in full across the UK. The 9 recommendations are: registration of commissioned services; standardise information sharing; improve quality through monitoring and evaluation; publication of a new action plan; reviewing ring-fenced RJ funding; explore automatic rights for victims through Victims Law; PCCs should end RJ funding blanket bans; more and better communications; and creating a specific RJ UK Government Minister. At our APPG meeting the chair Elliot Colburn MP stated that the report had been well received, but he was very disappointed that Victim’s Law did not mention RJ once.</p>
<p>As a member of the Petitions Committee, I attended a future work program meeting and I’m honoured to have been nominated to present the “<a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/554073">Ban greyhound racing to end the unnecessary deaths and suffering of racing dogs</a>” petition on behalf of the Petitions Committee in Westminster Hall on Monday 28th March. The petition has attracted 104,885 signatures.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-08/debates/d57f8a4a-304a-4bc1-9f56-c17cdc4ab6e6/DraftHumanMedicines(CoronavirusAndInfluenza)(Amendment)Regulations2022DraftHumanMedicines(AmendmentsRelatingToTheEarlyAccessToMedicinesScheme)Regulati"> Third Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which discussed 2 Statutory Instruments which were to be taken together because they have a similar purpose. The first SI concerns regulations made in 2020 which made temporary provisions for the manufacture and use of coronavirus and influenza vaccinations, to ensure that vaccines could be distributed and administered at pace. These regulations included a sunset clause which meant that the provisions ceased on 1st April 2022. This SI extends the sunset clause for some provisions to 1st April 2024, and makes others permanent. The second SI provided a statutory basis for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) which gives patients with life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to treatments that are either not authorised or not authorised for that particular clinical use. The members of the committee agreed that the 2 SIs be debated together. The UK Government Minister Ed Argar, moved and explained the SIs. The Labour Shadow Minister Andrew Gwynne and the SNP Spokesperson asked questions of the Minister, but did not oppose the SIs, which were approved without a division.</p>
<p>The Speaker granted the unprecedented request from the President of another country to make a direct, live, <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28902686-865d-48ea-ba23-90aa2aebd061?agenda=True">address to Parliamentarians</a> in the Chamber of the House of Commons. At 4.45pm the Speaker suspended the sitting so that MPs could take their seats, and Peers sat in the Private Gallery, to listen to the address from the President of Ukraine, who spoke to us in Ukrainian, but we all had headsets which carried contemporary translation. The President has shown immense courage and leadership in the face of the untrammelled aggression from Putin. Words are not enough to express the suffering of Ukraine people at the hands of a despot. We gave the President a standing ovation at the beginning and at the end of his speech. It was one of the most emotional moments of my life as an MP.</p>
<p>As chair of the APPG for Sport I met virtually with our secretariat Max and Leigh from the Sport and Recreation Alliance to plan our forthcoming APPG meetings for 2022. There are so many issues in the sport sector that need discussing. Some examples are: feedback on the Olympics and Paralympics; Sport in Devolved Nations – massive congratulations to my friend Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson who was appointed chair of Sport Wales this week – Tanni is vice-chair of our APPG; and the UK Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-russias-war-on-ukraine-international-sport">statement</a> released by Rt Hon Secretary of State DCMS Nadine Dorries MP about Russia’s War on Ukraine and International Sport.</p>
<p>I bobbed throughout the duration of PMQs, but unfortunately the Speaker did not call me. This is the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1501588121993031680?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">question would have asked</a> on behalf of my constituents: “On 1st March, two of my constituents went to Ukraine to rescue three family members. They applied for a Ukraine Family Scheme Visa and were given appointments at VAC Rzeszow, but Tatiana aged 65 was given 18th March, Olya aged 38 was given 21st March, and young Danil aged 9 was given 22nd March. They are now homeless. I’ve urged UK Visa and Immigration to act quickly and give the family appointments on the same day, but no answer. What would you tell my constituents Prime Minister?”.</p>
<p>As a Labour and Co-operative MP I reported back regarding the Wales Co-operative Council AGM to our monthly meeting of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. It is important that the work of the Group and the Council are mutually recognised for all the work that they do together to promote the values of the Co-operative Party.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to email christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152 – we are here to help.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am writing to you with information about local help for those affected by the situation in Ukraine as well as how you can contribute to the national fund being collected to support people affected by the War.</p>
<p>A local team has set up a collection centre for local donations in the old H&amp;M unit in the Ashley Centre. That’s the original unit near House of Fraser and not the double floored one which has closed recently. They are in the process of setting up a formal charity to do so, and have an organised plan to move donations out to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their biggest ask right now is for donations of medical supplies, and in particular things like bandages, as well as over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen. If you have items that you do not need, or are willing to buy some and drop them off there, I know that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>They are also asking for donations to help pay for fuel costs to get van loads of supplies to the Polish/Ukrainian border, and are able to take cash or card donations at the centre in Epsom.</p>
<p>If you want to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee/Red Cross national appeal the link to the appeal site is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dec.org.uk">www.dec.org.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>Your donation is being match funded by the Government.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me about providing accommodation locally for Ukrainian refugees. I am in discussions about this at the moment and will provide a further update later in the week.</p>

Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local MP wins refunds for residents of burned-out flats</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.shapps.com/local-mp-wins-refunds-for-residents-of-burned-out-flats/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=local-mp-wins-refunds-for-residents-of-burned-out-flats" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has won refunds for residents of Ashley Court, Hatfield, who were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire, and then subject to unfair service charges for housing they were unable to reside in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has been over a year since the residents of Ashley Court were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During this time residents, many of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site &amp;#8211; residing in temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building work aimed at restoring Ashley Court has also been delayed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, residents of Ashley Court were billed £225 per month in service charges for housing they had not occupied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This monthly fee included charges for various services, including a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, which residents were not benefitting from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 2021, local MP Grant Shapps wrote to Sanctuary Housing, the housing association responsible for managing Ashley Court, expressing his concern about “the impact on his constituents” nominally resident there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary Housing responded to Mr Shapps’ letter but at that time did not agree to waive the £225 a month charge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In February, Mr Shapps wrote to the association once again (below), this time saying that he was putting it “on notice” over its unfair treatment of residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40879" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40880" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following this most recent letter, Sanctuary Housing responded quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a major victory for the residents, the association apologised, saying that it had got its “approach wrong” regarding Ashley Court, and that it would be refunding service charge payments to residents as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The association also said it would refund payments for deceased residents to their respective estates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary Housing stated it would be conducting a “more detailed review” of how the residents of Ashley Court were put in their previous unfair situation and would share its findings with Mr Shapps’ office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The association agreed to meet with Mr Shapps in March saying that its representative would apologise in person, and that it would put itself on the “appropriate footing” to work with him going forward. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councillor Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of the residents of Ashley court, will also attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Hebden said of the recent good news: “This is a fantastic step forward for the residents. There are other issues to be resolved but if Sanctuary Housing are adopting a new resident-focussed stance then I’m a lot more optimistic”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps gave his own thoughts on the matter adding: “This is a great result for the residents of Ashley Court, and I’m incredibly happy to have been part of the effort to facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As Councillor Hebden has said, this is a step forward for the residents, and I’m sure that our meeting with Sanctuary Housing will yield further results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Putting residents in such an unfair situation was unacceptable, so I’m hoping that this outcome will go some way to putting their minds at ease.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <title>City Council Leader Responds to “Levelling Up” Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/02/02/city-council-leader-responds-to-levelling-up-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
