<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>).

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

    <title>Chi Onwurah exposes another false Tory Promise, on Dementia research.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2022/01/chi-onwurah-exposes-another-false-tory-promise-on-dementia-research/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle Central , today highlighted another broken promise from the Tory government. The Conservative Manifesto in 2019 contained a promise to double R&amp;amp;D spending on dementia research, yet the reality is that government spending on dementia research has &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt;. Chi had asked a written question to the government, the response showed that total research spending on dementia had dropped from £112.9million to £104.7million from 2018/19 to 2019/20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With UK cases set to increase by 75% by 2050, now is not the time to be cutting back on dementia research. From the despatch box, Chi asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would the Minister confirm that dementia R&amp;amp;D spend has gone down since his government took office?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister, George Freeman MP, did not deny spending had decreased, stating “we are in the process of allocating money” without specifying whether this would meet the manifesto commitment to doubling dementia research spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour are committed to doubling spending on dementia research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi Said: “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dementia is something that threatens all of our futures and imposes huge private and public costs. The UK is particularly strong in life sciences and dementia research, now is the time to be accelerating investment to help us deal with the predicted growth in dementia cases. The government has instead broken another promise to the British people and scientific community, risking our future security and prosperity for the sake of a short-sighted cost cutting exercise.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Many researchers funded by charitable institutions  lost funding during Covid as charitable fund-raising was hit  and despite repeated calls the Government provided little support. To learn that Government funding was also cut at this time is particularly concerning.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>New figures from the House of Commons Library at the number of care homes in the county has dropped by 32% since 2015 from 213 down to 145.</p>
<p>The numbers for Cumbria is over three times higher than the national average in England which has seen a 10% reduction in beds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the number of beds in Cumbria has dropped by more than one in five, down from 5,839 to 4,363.</p>
<p>Parliamentary constituencies in Cumbria made up three of the five areas with the biggest drop in care home beds - Penrith and the Border 2<sup>nd</sup> (-318 beds), Copeland 3<sup>rd</sup> (-309 beds) and Tim's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency 5<sup>th</sup> (-297 beds).</p>
<p>Tim is tabling a Written Parliamentary Question to the Health Secretary Sajid Javid to ask what the he will be doing to support Cumbria's struggling social care sector.</p>
<p>Tim said: "<em>We know that social care in this country is under enormous pressure but these figures reveal just how desperate the situation has become.</em></p>
<p><em>"While of course there has been a move in recent years for people to be cared for at home, the staffing crisis in the sector is leading to some care homes being left with no choice but to close their doors.</em></p>
<p><em>"With a growing elderly population, it should greatly concern us all that our loved ones might not receive the care that they deserve - despite the best efforts of those working on the front line.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Government are hiking the National Insurance contributions of working people from April but have yet to give any clear indication of whether this money will be used to support Cumbria's struggling social care sector.</em></p>
<p><em>"Local social care staff are on their knees - it's high time the Government acted."</em></p>

    <title>Isles MP welcomes bus travel bonus for children and young people</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/01/11/isles-mp-welcomes-bus-travel-bonus-for-children-and-young-people/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Isles MP Angus MacNeil is encouraging all children and young people in Na h-Eileanan an Iar to apply for a new or replacement National Entitlement Card (NEC) which will now provide free bus travel to everyone up to the age of 22.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id="3571" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/angus-lighthouse-landscape/" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg" data-orig-size="2016,980" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="Angus lighthouse landscape" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-3571" srcset="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/angus-lighthouse-landscape.jpeg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From this week, all young people and children aged 5-21 years old can apply for their new or replacement National Entitlement Card (NEC) or Young Scot NEC to access the scheme from 31 January 2022. The scheme, extending free bus travel to everyone up to 22, builds on the Scottish Government’s commitment to providing free bus travel to all under-19’s in Scotland which started in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil&amp;nbsp;has welcomed the initiative which will cover travel across the Western Isles and also on the mainland which will be particularly helpful to island students travelling regularly between their island homes and mainland locations for university and college.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scheme is set to benefit around 930,000 young people across Scotland with research from Transport Scotland indicating that 70% of young people would use public transport more frequently if it was free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Commenting Mr MacNeil said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am delighted that applications are now open for young people in Na h-Eileanan an Iar under the age of 22, to apply for free bus travel across the country. This is a hugely significant commitment from the Scottish Government that will benefit hundreds of thousands of young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Making bus travel free for under 22&amp;#8217;s is not only important for helping tackle the climate emergency but it will also take pressure off young people&amp;#8217;s finances and improve their access to education, leisure, and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Whilst we continue to live through the pandemic, we all recognise that essential travel must be prioritised so I want to specifically encourage children and young people with essential journeys to make to apply now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The SNP Scottish Government is once again making an investment in our young people’s future, supporting them to have the best possible start in life and creating the fairer, greener Scotland that we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scheme will be delivered in partnership with Transport Scotland, the Improvement Service, the National Entitlement Card Programme Office (NECPO), Young Scot, local authorities and bus operators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Information about the scheme and how to apply is available here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/concessionary-travel/young-persons-free-bus-travel-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.transport.gov.scot/concessionary-travel/young-persons-free-bus-travel-scheme/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My speeches in the Charter for Budget Responsibility and Welfare Cap debate, 10 January 2022</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2022/01/11/my-intervention-in-the-charter-for-budget-responsibility-and-welfare-cap-debate-10-january-2022/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Redwood &amp;#8211; (Wokingham) (Con) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;Could my right hon. Friend comment on what difference, if any, he thinks it makes that a significant proportion of that debt is now owned by the Bank of England, which is 100% owned by the Government on behalf of the taxpayers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Clarke (Chief Secretary to the Treasury) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;The Bank of England has obviously helped to underpin our wider response to the crisis that we face. Clearly, it does have a bearing on the relevant significance of debt, but it would be simply irresponsible to leave ourselves exposed in the manner in which we risk being if we fail to constrain the borrowing, which risks otherwise becoming an unacceptable burden and which would leave us very vulnerable. A 1% rise in interest rates would cost the Exchequer £22.8 billion in 2025-26. That is a meaningful level of exposure and one which we want to take action to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;Further to that point, is my right hon. Friend not quoting a gross figure for the impact of a rise in interest rates, and quite a bit of that would be credited back to the Bank of England, which, in turn, could pay it back as a dividend to the Treasury?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Clarke (Chief Secretary to the Treasury) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;I think it remains the case that we need to make sure that our debt-to-GDP ratio is more sustainable than it is at present, and I do not think colleagues would significantly demur from that. I take the point that, obviously, there is an interaction—some of these interactions are of a relatively circular nature—between the Bank and Exchequer, but none the less, it is important that we control our public debt. Indeed, we were able to respond to the pandemic as comprehensively as we did precisely because of the fiscal space created since 2010. The fact that we faced two once-in-a-generation shocks in just over a decade highlights why we must have the buffers to provide support when it is needed most and why we must act to rebuild those buffers, so that we are ready for any future shocks. In its most recent “Fiscal risks report”—not an easy one to splutter out—the OBR said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the absence of perfect foresight, fiscal space may be the single most valuable risk management tool”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final reason we need to keep our debt under control is simple: our public finances are the legacy we leave for future generations, and the decisions we take now will have a material impact on the lives and livelihoods of our grandchildren. They will help or hinder challenges, from climate change to an ageing population, or indeed to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter for budget responsibility contains new fiscal rules to guide us back to fiscal sustainability in a fair and responsible way. The rules will ensure that we get debt down over the medium term. They will allow us to deliver a significant uplift in capital investment, in turn driving economic prosperity, but without burdening future generations with borrowing to fund our day-to-day spending. The new rules require that underlying public sector net debt, excluding the impact of the Bank of England, must as a percentage of GDP be falling. The current budget must be in balance, which means that everyday spending must be paid for through taxation. Both rules must be met by the third year of every forecast period, giving us the flexibility to respond to events in the near term, such as omicron, while credibly keeping the public finances under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a third rule will ensure that public sector net investment does not exceed 3% of GDP on average over the forecast period. This rule will allow the Government to deliver on our ambitious plans for investment over this Parliament, with the highest sustained levels of PSNI as a proportion of GDP since the late 1970s. With this rule, we are delivering on plans to invest more than £600 billion in gross public sector investment over this Parliament to spread prosperity across the UK. The £4.8 billion levelling-up fund is part of that. An unprecedented investment package of £5.7 billion for eight English city regions to transform their local transport networks is also part of it. On top of these commitments, the UK Infrastructure Bank is now open for business and is expected to support more than £40 billion of infrastructure investment. Crucially, the rule also mitigates the risk of increasing debt to an unsustainable level. Our fiscally responsible approach supports growth while keeping debt under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, these rules will guide responsible decision making. The International Monetary Fund has noted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Countries that have followed a debt rule have typically managed to reverse a jump in debt&amp;#8230;significantly faster than other countries”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it recently assessed that the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“new fiscal rules have anchored fiscal policy well”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our support for the economy and early responsible decisions to strengthen our public finances, in its October forecast, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed that the rules were met. The current budget is in surplus and underlying debt is forecast to fall in the current target year, 2024-25. The rules will guide fiscal policy for at least this Parliament and will be reviewed at the start of each Parliament to ensure they reflect the economic context and mean that we can deliver for the British people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the rules in this charter, we will go further, becoming one of the first countries to formally consider the broader public sector balance sheet in our management of fiscal policy. The OBR will now forecast broader measures, including public sector net worth, which it says provides a fuller picture of fiscal sustainability and allows for more sophisticated analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter also retains the welfare cap in order to keep welfare spending on a sustainable path and to support the other rules in strengthening the public finances. Since the cap was last set at Budget 2020, the covid pandemic has had a significant impact on the medium-term outlook for welfare spending. To reflect that and to align with the updated fiscal framework, the level of the cap is being reset in line with the latest forecast. That leads to an effective increase of £10.5 billion in the cap by 2024-25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;Let me return to the subject of the debate, the charter for budget responsibility. I will not follow the Opposition into a debate on the general state of the UK economy, which I am sure we will have other opportunities to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this as the Maastricht rules tribute debate. Every year under the Maastricht treaty, whether under Labour, coalition or Conservative Governments, we used to have a debate. We had to look at the two fiscal rules, which of course both came from the European Union: rule one was that the budget deficit had to be 3% of GDP or less; and rule two was that we had to either be below 60% of GDP with our state debt, or we had to show how we were going to get down to 60% of GDP with spending cuts or tax rises. The UK normally favoured the tax rise route, rather than the spending cut route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was characterised by the Opposition parties of the day, once the Conservatives or the coalition were in office, as austerity economics, although they would never accept that the cause of the austerity was the rules designed in Brussels. They would point out, when I made that point, that, “Oh well, because the UK is not a member of the euro there are not the same penalties imposed if the UK fails to comply.” The fact was, however, that the whole UK economic machine—Bank, Treasury and officialdom—believed they were very serious commitments and that, as they were treaty commitments, the UK had to keep to them. So when we finally got out of the EU, I was one of those voices saying to the Government, “Let’s scrap all that. Let’s not have those Maastricht tribute debates”—although I think we had one even after we left—“and let’s have our own UK framework.” That is what we should be debating tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government have come up with a charter for budget responsibility, which I welcome, but reading the detail, it has a familiar ring to it. What are the two main rules in the charter? One is that we must keep the budget deficit down to 3% or below. It has been repackaged in relation to investment, but it is basically the 3% Maastricht budget deficit rule. The second rule is that, by the third year, debt should be falling as a percentage of GDP. Of course, our debt is well above 60%, and it will be quite a long time before we get back to 60%, if at all. It is now built into the framework as a regular review item, although it has the extra twist that it is a three-year average, so there is a bit more scope for flexing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can do better than this Government. We could come up with an economic framework geared to the modern needs of an independent country, and I would suggest that our charter should embed two great aims of economic policy. The first aim that it should definitely embed is controlling inflation. It is right that the so-called independent Bank of England—this House regularly changes the rules and shows that it is actually in charge of the Bank of England—is charged with the duty of keeping inflation down to around 2% on average. I have no problem with that as a target, but the Government need to adopt it as a target as well, because as Ministers must well know, we cannot do all of the heavy lift through monetary policy—we cannot do it all through interest rates or quantitative easing. We also need to have a sensible fiscal policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, the Government, who control such a huge chunk of the economy, need to manage their own affairs well, in terms of productivity, sensible real wage growth and so forth, and they have a duty to follow an anti-inflation strategy for the public sector directly under their control as a back-up to what the Bank and monetary policy are trying to do. I think that we should embed the inflation policy more firmly in the charter and that the Treasury should have to tell us how it is contributing to controlling inflation. It will be very topical this year, because clearly inflation is considerably above where we would all like it to be and there is no immediate sign that it is about to drop down, although I think it will drop down towards the end of the year, unless policy is particularly foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second criterion or objective that I would put in the charter is a growth objective. Labour made an entirely fair point by saying that what matters is growth. The faster the growth—as long as it is not inflationary—the more we would solve our deficit and debt problems. Our economy and our figures are incredibly sensitive to the growth rate. In the first half of the current financial year, we had very fast growth. It was a recovery phase and things were going fairly well from the covid lockdowns. As always, the OBR and the Treasury completely misjudged what favourable impact growth has, so they overstated the deficit for the first six months of the year by a whopping £50 billion. The deficit tumbled by £50 billion more, with no tax rises. But there was a huge tax rise—it was called tax on growth. More people went to work, and more people earned higher wages, bonuses or salaries. More people spent more money, so there was more VAT. So income tax receipts, VAT receipts and other receipts in the economy greatly outperformed the OBR and Treasury forecast, demonstrating that, if we can go for growth, we will make much better progress on the debt and deficit, which we need to do, than if we go for austerity economics, slowing the economy with tax rises and a too abrupt monetary deceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge the Government to look again at whether they can improve on the objectives in the charter, to reflect on it and to see how an independent Britain can have a growth policy. If the Government established a growth target—they would not always hit it, but they could establish it—it would start to inform the actions of every Government Department that has a bearing on the strength of our economy, new jobs and all the rest of it. That is what we want. We want a Whitehall that is positive about Britain, not one that is trying to hold it back. We want a Whitehall that thinks Britain can achieve things—can invest here, have more jobs here and substitute for imports—rather than a negative Whitehall that says, “Gosh, there is too much borrowing, What can we cut? What can we tax? What can we stop?” We want less stopping and more positive going. We want more ability, generated by a growth policy, to show that an independent Britain can produce more of its own energy, grow more of its own food, catch more of its own fish, and make more of its own personal protective equipment and of its own medical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Linden (Glasgow East) (SNP) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;That speech would perhaps have done even better with “Jerusalem” on in the background. The right hon. Gentleman speaks about growing more food, but can he tell me who is going to pick that food from our fields?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con) &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;It will be picked by people paid decent wages, and if that requires wages to go up a bit, I have no problem with that. It will also be picked by the growing mechanisation of agriculture. Our agriculture is not as fully mechanised in a lot of farms as it is possible to do when there are better capitalised farms, like those that have been growing more food elsewhere. How pessimistic that was—why is the hon. Gentleman not proud of the United Kingdom, Scotland or wherever, thinking that we can achieve more and do more? Why do we always have to be stopping people doing things, and saying that nothing is going to work and so let us import all our vegetables from Spain, all our flowers from the Netherlands and all our energy from Russia, Germany or the Netherlands or wherever because we are not able to do it here in Britain? It is just not good enough. We have this huge opportunity. We have a very talented people. We have many natural resources. We have a perfectly good temperate climate for growing most of our own food. So, Government, get on with it. Having a growth target would help energise a Whitehall that still seems to be very disappointed in the country it is trying to govern and seems to be trying to hold it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing that the Chief Secretary mentioned in his remarks, which is mentioned briefly in the text we are debating tonight, intrigues me. It says that balance-sheet items are being worked on but have not yet reached a state of development where they can be shared with the rest of us. How long does it take? Why do the officials to the Government not know the asset and net asset position for the country? I believe there are some figures we can get from public sources that show that we do have some guesses about all that, but is it not rather important that when we debate the state of the nation’s finances, we understand the balance sheet as well as the income account and that we know whether the public sector is adding value and long-term wealth or not? If it is, why do we not claim some credit for it? If it is not doing enough of that, we need to ask the difficult questions about the wisdom of the investments, the productivity of the schemes and all the things that go into making that a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did ask the Chief Secretary about a balance-sheet item. I think it actually makes a difference if you have bought in your own debt, because you owe the debt to yourself. I am not asking for anything imprudent to be done. I understand why we have gone through this rather tortured process, as has the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Board, and as, for many years, has the Bank of Japan. But we should not then fool ourselves into thinking that we have a worse problem than we have. The fact is that all these countries and currency areas spent a lot of money and created a lot of money to buy in debt over the pandemic, and we have got away with it, with a caveat that we have a little too much inflation. That debt is purchased; it is now both an asset as well as a liability of the state, so it is wrong to think that it is just a liability. The new argument is, “We owe the Bank of England and if the short rates go up, we owe the Bank of England more interest and so forth”. Yes, but it gets the receipt. If we want to do the transaction, the Treasury pays the Bank and the Bank can pay the Treasury back, because the Treasury owns the Bank. If I had bought in my mortgage from a mortgage company, I would probably just forget the whole thing. However, on Bank of England and Treasury logic, every month I would pay interest to myself because I still owe the mortgage, but then I could take that money back and spend it because I own the mortgage company and it is no longer a proper debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we have to understand that something different has occurred with quantitative easing, and I do not think we should go on doing it. It is normally very inflationary and very dangerous. In the strange circumstances of a covid lockdown in which a huge amount of demand and activity were taken out of the system, we could get away with it; indeed, it was right to do it, and I supported the Government at the time and praised them for the stimulus they offered. However, that has gone, and we now need to have sensible finances. To run those well, I strongly recommend a firm inflation target—inflation is a little too high at the moment, and needs to be taken very seriously—coupled with a much more optimistic growth target, because that is the way to grow the balance sheet and get the debt and the deficit down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Llanelli
MP, Nia Griffith today criticised the Conservatives for a decade of dither,
delay and poor planning on Britain’s energy sector – as well as calling for a
windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas to stop energy bills rising over the next
year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She
pointed to the Tory UK Government’s failure to meet the vast potential of
British renewable and nuclear energy and its failure to properly regulate our
energy market, leading to dozens of energy companies going bust.&amp;nbsp; The result is rapidly rising prices and an
energy crisis hitting millions, including many families across Llanelli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To
address the immediate crisis, Labour are calling for fully-funded measures now
to reduce the expected price rise in April &amp;#8211; saving most households around £200
or more – and targeted extra support to the squeezed middle, pensioners and the
lowest earners, receiving up to £600 off bills and preventing all of the
increase in energy bills currently expected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This
would be paid for with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas
producers who have profited from the price rises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Highlighting
how crucial it is to keep energy bills lower in future, Labour have said they
would: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce Britain’s reliance on imported gas by accelerating home-grown
renewables and new nuclear &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure millions more homes are warm and well-insulated, saving
households an average of £400 a year on bills&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regulate the market better, with a pledge to never again let energy
companies play fast and loose with the rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIA
GRIFFITH said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ten
years of the Conservative’s failed energy policy, dither and delay has created
a price crisis that’s being felt by people right here in Llanelli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s
why Labour would give local families security by taking fully-funded measures
to save most households around £200 or more, targeting extra support on top of
that for the squeezed middle, pensioners and lowest earners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But we need more than a short-term fix.  Labour’s plan to keep energy bills lower in future would mean really speeding up investment in renewable energy, both to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and to tackle climate change, retro fit millions of more homes to save households an average of £400 a year on their bills, and reform our broken energy system.  It is only right, after all, that the energy producers benefitting from this crisis are asked to pay their fair sh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I commend my hon. Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement for the care that he is taking in dealing with the challenges of the Ajax contract, and for the transparency with which he is keeping the House up to date with the problems? Does he agree that the production contract, which was entered into in 2014, was characterised by transferring risk to the contractor? Had we followed the practice of the previous Labour Government, trumpeted by the shadow Secretary of State, the risk would have stayed with the Ministry of Defence and the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=4507"&gt;Jeremy Quin (The Minister for Defence Procurement)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. Had this been like the Nimrod situation, where £3.7 billion was wasted by the previous Government and they attempted to blame it on us, that would have been where we are, but we are not; we have a firm-price contract with General Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-01-10/debates/184c32f4-d038-4d34-a9b3-d617362dea96/CommonsChamber#contribution-0F967D72-491E-4EAB-ACE9-6AA5208A1767"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;

Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has today slammed the Conservatives for ‘awful management&amp;#8217; of Britain’s energy sector – and has joined calls for a windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas to stop energy bills rising over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy prices have soared over recent months, leaving people and businesses struggling to meet the costs. The last energy price cap increase, in October, pushed bills to an average of £1,277 a year for a dual-fuel bill. The next review is expected to push bills up by 50% to nearer £2,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour have pointed to the government’s failure to meet the vast potential of British renewable and nuclear energy, failure to make more homes warm and well-insulated, and failure to properly regulate the energy market, leading to dozens of energy companies going bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the immediate crisis, Labour have outlined fully-funded measures to reduce the expected price rise in April. The move would save most households around £200 or more. It would also offer support to pensioners and the lowest earners, who would receive up to £600 off bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour would fund the plan with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas producers who have profited from price rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlighting how crucial it is to keep energy bills lower in future, Labour have said they would:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Reduce Britain’s reliance on imported gas by accelerating home-grown renewables and new nuclear&lt;br /&gt;
• Make sure 19 million homes are warm and well-insulated, saving households an average of £400 a year on bills&lt;br /&gt;
• Regulate the market better, with a pledge to never again let energy companies play fast and loose with the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting on the plan, Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Conservatives have been in power for over 10 years. In that time they have repeatedly failed to meet the vast potential of British renewable energy. Awful management and years of dither and delay is now hitting working people hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to stop bills going up for people and businesses across Denton and Reddish. This is why Labour’s plan to give families extra security is so crucial. By taking fully-funded measures we could save most households around £200 or more, and give people the support they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside these measures, Labour would plan to keep energy bills lower in the future by accelerating home-grown renewable energy. We urgently need to reform our broken energy system to stop anything like this happening again. The green energy transition is not only good for the planet, but consumers too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People across Denton and Reddish deserve an affordable and secure energy system that works for them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Labour Councillors Calling on Government to take burden of Social Care Funding from the Council Tax Payer</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/01/10/labour-councillors-calling-on-government-to-take-burden-of-social-care-funding-from-the-council-tax-payer/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;At Full Council on Monday 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; January Nottingham City Labour Councillors are expressing their disappointment with the Government’s response to the social care crisis and pressing them for a fair funding system for social care that does not involve further council tax rises. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Proposing the motion, Cllr Graham Chapman is expected to say “The amount of additional funding, both in the short and long term, will not ‘fix the problem’. The Government continues to rely on regressive council tax increases to plug gaps and there is no long-term strategy for training, recruitment, sustainable wage growth, or professionalising  the sector service which struggling to recruit. This results in further pressure on the NHS as social care is less able to prevent admission and the support that people need in order for them to leave hospital safely and promptly &amp;#8211; or prevent admission &amp;#8211;  is in short supply. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Government needs to provide a better solution than the piecemeal policy it has just announced. It needs to be properly funded, comprehensive. &amp;#8211; if necessary via a levy on wealth of those who can afford it to ensure that there is no further call on council tax payers, many of whom are already struggling. Not doing so is just adding more pressure and costs on the NHS  as well as offering an inadequate service to some of the most vulnerable in our community. “&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In 2015 the Conservative Government introduced the adult social care precept which put up to an additional 3% on council tax bills to pay for social care services for adults. In the last two years alone that has meant an extra £89 on council tax bills in Nottingham. This comes at the same time as funding from central government to meet the needs of Nottingham people has been cut by £100 million over 10 years, &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Commenting on the local context, Portfolio Holder for Adults and Health, Cllr Adele Williams said “It isn’t only that government funding for adult social care  just isn’t enough- it’s also the way it is done &amp;#8211; in piecemeal short term announcement designed to sound like significant funding but actually falling well short of the sustainable long term plan that Labour has called for &amp;#8211; along with the Association of Directors  of Adult Social Care and it seems virtually everyone but the government. It’s also important that we don’t just focus on protecting the assets of wealthy homeowners. Few people in Nottingham will benefit and many will lose out  from the changes to the new asset rules that are to be funded by  the new levy on National insurance &amp;#8211;  but nearly all of us will pay for it. It will also do nothing to support the availability of care, the pay that carers get or the quality of the service.  “Instead of a real plan to build the social care system we need for the 21st century, we have another inadequate sticking plaster that the wrong people are paying too much for. I hope this motion on Monday will help put pressure on the Government for a fair and sustainable solution to adult social care funding.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The agenda for the Full Council meeting can be found here &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="https://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=155&amp;amp;MId=9182"&gt;https://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=155&amp;amp;MId=9182&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Have you made any New Year resolutions? On Tuesday, the Labour leader was in Birmingham setting out his. We&#8217;ve had a year of disappointments. It&#8217;s easy for that to lead to cynicism and eventually result in a lack of trust.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the conclusion Keir Starmer has come to. He wants a new contract with voters, a set of principles by which they can judge him and core values around which we build.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s right, people need a renewed faith in politics. They must feel able to trust the basic things a government says.</p>



<p>How else are we to manage a continuing pandemic which has had such a disruptive impact on our lives?</p>



<p>The foundation of Keir&#8217;s approach will be three principles: security, prosperity and respect.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve already heard some dismiss this as not catchy enough, but as he points out, politics isn&#8217;t entertainment. At best, it should offer a degree of predictability which allows us to plan and think ahead.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t plan without basic security.</p>



<p>We need to feel safe in our homes and communities and able to rely on a system of law and criminal justice that will protect us, look after victims and punish wrongdoers.</p>



<p>As the year begins, we face rising prices, higher taxes and low growth. We won&#8217;t achieve prosperity with slogans or pepper pot funding that merely tries to satisfy short-term party-political needs.</p>



<p>Growth and prosperity require an industrial strategy designed to build the industries and jobs of the future.</p>



<p>And a society where there&#8217;s no respect for tradition, for rules and the rights of others is one on which we can&#8217;t depend.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve lost too much of it and need to rediscover respect and mutuality if we&#8217;re to create a future for all that builds on the proud traditions of our past.</p>



<p>I think Keir is onto something, but it&#8217;s not enough for politicians to tell people what they&#8217;ll do. They need to listen, to respect the views of voters and be straight with them about what&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>Security, Prosperity and Respect seem to me like a good focus for the political resolutions we need.</p>

    <title>“Government must cut energy bill VAT to prevent perfect storm of crippling household bills in Bristol South” – Karin Smyth MP</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/01/06/government-must-cut-energy-bill-vat-to-prevent-perfect-storm-of-crippling-household-bills-in-bristol-south-karin-smyth-mp/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=government-must-cut-energy-bill-vat-to-prevent-perfect-storm-of-crippling-household-bills-in-bristol-south-karin-smyth-mp" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South has today (Wednesday January 5th) called on the Government to cut VAT on domestic energy bills to avoid a “perfect storm of crippling household bills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her proposal, pushed in the House of Commons today by the Labour Party,  would make people’s energy bills cheaper and provide immediate relief to the budgets of 28m UK households as the cost of living crisis hits working people in Bristol. The call comes as inflation rises and energy bills leave many feeling the pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labour Party’s VAT cut on domestic energy bills &amp;#8211; which would change the charge from 5% to zero &amp;#8211; could see people through the winter months, and would be automatically deducted from bills. The VAT cut would be paid for using the extra money coming from a higher than expected surplus of VAT receipts accrued since the start of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour have also announced plans to ramp up the ambition on retrofitting homes for sustainable, long-term reduction in energy bills to further tackle rising energy costs and the climate emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Families in Bristol South are being hit by a cost-of-living crisis which has seen energy bills soar, food costs increase and the weekly budget stretched. As winter looms, they are facing a perfect storm of crippling household bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of doing something to help family budgets, the Tory Government have instead cut Universal Credit and hiked national insurance.  This is why Labour is calling on the Government to immediately remove VAT on domestic energy bills for six months, to provide immediate financial support to struggling families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Government has the opportunity to do the right thing and give working people in Bristol South a helping hand by providing an immediate cut to their energy bills so they can stay warm this winter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ARTICLE: The Best of our Communities</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/article-the-best-of-our-communities/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=article-the-best-of-our-communities" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Often in the worst of times, we see the best of people. That’s especially true in our communities, where, every day, we see people doing incredible work. In fact, they are so busy helping others it is sometimes too easy to forget just how special they are.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to celebrate some of these heroes in Parliament – and where it has been safe to do so, meet with them, and thank them, in person.  But there are many more, the unsung majority – you will know a few of them yourselves. You may even be one of them but don’t even think about it.</p>
<p>To them all, I say thank you.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, no better example of the best of our communities than the MFR Cash for Kids Christmas Appeal.</p>
<p>People across the Highlands came together to ensure every local child had a gift to open on Christmas day.</p>
<p>The incredible Cash for Kids team worked flat out to deliver all the gifts across the Highlands – and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>They were supported by local fundraisers, businesses, volunteers, and all of you, who took the time to buy a gift that is sure to have put a smile on a child’s face on Christmas day, not to mention offer some slight relief to struggling parents.</p>
<p>It is heart-warming to imagine the weight lifted off families and the smile on the face of their child – even if it was just for one day.</p>
<p>Especially when more families than ever before are facing a tough time.</p>
<p>Along with amazing local charities, foodbanks and community volunteers, my team and I are doing all we can to help as well as continuing to urge the UK Government to change course.</p>
<p>But the reality is, the UK Government know the impact of the choices they are making, these are deliberate actions.</p>
<p>With its limited powers over Social Security the Scottish Government is showing different choices can be made by putting dignity and respect at the heart of policy.</p>
<p>What better place to start building a Social Security system ensuring every child has a fair start in life?</p>
<p>As we look ahead to 2022, I hope this is a statement of intent on which we can all agree.</p>
<p>To you and your family, from me, my family, and my team, I wish you a Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Last year- December 15 2020, an electrical fire damaged Ashley Court in Hatfield. Residents, a number of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site in temporary accommodation since the incident.</p>
<p>Sanctuary have handed over control of the site to a construction team to restore the block, but earlier this year residents were shocked to find that they were being charged £225 per month in service charges to the Housing Association.</p>
<p>Residents, who are still not able to come back to Ashley Court, are being charged for a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, alarm rental and monitoring, ground maintenance, water rates, electricity , internal maintenance, waste disposal, lift, laundry equipment, building insurance, internal maintenance and window cleaning. All of which they are not able to get any benefit from.</p>
<p>After the fire, security guards were in place to guard the property. However, they were removed after a short amount of time and a number of flats were broken into this September, with personal items stolen.</p>
<p>Cllr Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, contacted Sanctuary about this issue in October, asking them to look again at this situation and stop demanding payment from the displaced residents.</p>
<p>Sanctuary responded to Cllr Hebden’s letter, but did not agree to waive the £225 p/m charge on the residents.</p>
<p>Now, Mr Shapps has written a letter (below) Sanctuary Housing’s CEO Craig Moule about this issue to reiterate the need for this charge to be waived, and for residents to be refunded.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Of the case, Cllr Peter Hebden said: “The response I received from Sanctuary Housing was very disappointing and didn’t address the issues from the residents’ perspective at all. This is now the 2nd Christmas that residents will be away from their homes and that is totally unacceptable. Sanctuary Housing need to seriously review their approach as to how they manage major incidents such as this and keep the residents at the forefront of their plans. They have shown little understanding and compassion for the terrible time the residents have gone through.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “The residents of Ashley Court have been away from their homes for a year now- living with friends, family and in other temporary accommodation through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>“It does not seem fair that they are having to shell out cash for lifts and equipment that isn’t being used, for waste disposal when they aren’t living there, and for a caretaker and window cleaning on a building that is essentially a building site.</p>
<p>“So I’m hoping that the CEO of Sanctuary Housing will agree with myself and Cllr Hebden, and put the minds of the Ashley Court residents at ease by waiving these charges.”<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p></div>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-70/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My week in Westminster began when I joined the Wales All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Hospitality, Events, and Major Food and Drink Businesses, chaired by Jess Morden MP, to receive an update from many guest speakers involved in this very important sector in Wales.</p>
<p>David Chapman, Executive Director for Wales UK Hospitality introduced the discussion by highlighting the recruitment crisis in the sector. Staffing is 30% down on 2020 levels because of, amongst other things, less migrant workers, end of the furlough scheme and business rates relief (England), the increase in VAT from 5 to 12.5% on 1st October 2021, which will go up to 20% on 1st April 2022, competition from other sectors that have more regular working hours, and staff isolating because of Covid regulations. Staff that have loyally remained in the sector are suffering from mental health issues and anxiety due to overwork because they are covering other members of staff duties.</p>
<p>The Group Task and Development Director at Celtic Manor Group, which consists of seven hotels and venues, spoke about the high level of vacancies she has in both permanent and casual posts. Many who left in March 2020 have not returned, and that it’s now a candidates market because of staff shortages, so candidates dictate and negotiate the terms of their employment. And even though all roles have received increased wages, many are still leaving for jobs with slightly higher rates of pay.</p>
<p>The Welsh Rarebit Collective represents 200 independent hotels and its representative said that the lack of staff has never been so bad in the Wales hospitality sector. Many of his members have to turn away business because of lack of staff. He had conducted a straw poll amongst his members and only 11% are running at full capacity, whilst 80% are turning away business.</p>
<p>The speakers also agreed that there was a perception in the UK that a job in the hospitality sector was something that is fitted in between school and university, or a temporary job until securing a “proper” career, rather than being viewed as a genuine career itself. And that one of the major challenges is to change this culture, which should begin in schools and colleges.</p>
<p>I dropped in to the Women’s Aid photo session which was held to promote their #DeserveToBeHeard campaign supporting women who have suffered domestic abuse and the barriers they have faced when seeking help. I pledged to #HearHer. Please read more – Mental Health and Domestic Abuse – by Women’s Aid. Reframing the Links: Black and minorities women, domestic violence, and abuse, and mental health- A Review of the Literature – by Ravi Thiara and Christine Harrison University of Warwick.</p>
<p>The APPG for Rare, Genetic, and Undiagnosed Conditions joined with the APPG for Life Sciences Diseases, jointly chaired by Liz Twist MP and Daniel Zeichner MP, to discuss the UK Rare Diseases Framework. This is an important piece of policy development which will change the landscape for people affected by rare conditions. Whilst the population of an individual rare disease is small, there are over seven thousand identified rare conditions, consequently one in seventeen will be affected by a rare condition at sometime in their lives which equates to 3.5 million in the UK and three quarters of all rare diseases affect children. It is estimated that these rare diseases are responsible for about a third of infant mortality in the UK and it takes about four years to be diagnosed with a rare condition. But licensed medical products are only available for a small minority of rare diseases, making it very difficult for patients to access potentially life saving treatment. The Framework was released in January 2021. The guest speakers discussed the development of the UK Government Action Plans that will implement the Framework, and will be announced at the beginning of next year. These Action Plans are vital in leading systemic change so that people with rare diseases are given the care they need.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the Second Delegated Legislation Committee which discussed the Draft Solvency 2 (Group Supervision) (Amendment) Regulations 2021. The draft instrument was made to address deficiencies in retained EU Law. It will ensure that an equivalence decision which assesses that the insurance group supervision regime in another country is equivalent to that in the UK and avoids duplication of supervisory work in relation to insurance groups. HM Treasury explain that the purpose is to ensure that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) where it is group supervisor of a UK insurance group with a parent in a third country, including the EU, can defer to the supervisory authority in that third country in certain circumstances, if the insurance group supervision regime in the third country has been assessed as equivalent to the UK‘s regime. HMT says that these changes will avoid unnecessary duplication, reduce regulatory compliance cost for UK insurance groups, reduce supervisory cost for the PRA, and reduce the need for co-ordination between third country supervisor authorities and the PRA. The members of the committee debated the draft instrument which was passed unanimously without a division.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup> December I attended the APPG Wales and the World, chaired by Craig Williams MP for Montgomeryshire, and attended by Simon Baynes MP, Liz Saville-Roberts MP, Robin Millar MP, and Ben Lake MP. The meeting was addressed by Megan Williams, who runs the Welsh North American Association. Megan explained how the Association was set up and since 1929 has organised an annual Gymanfa Ganu. It currently has 2500 members, publishes the Ninnau Newspaper and has links with Welsh Associations across America and the World, including the Welsh Society of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As a member of the Petitions Committee I was selected to lead a Westminster Hall Petition Debate on 13th December, on behalf petitioner Richard Ackers who set up Justice for Reggie, following the death of his puppy Reggie from Parvovirus within a few days of buying Reggie from an online seller. Richard’s petition, which closed with over 109,000 signatures, calls for regulating all websites where animals are sold, including verification of sellers’ identity and pictures of animals for sale with their parents. Ahead of the debate I held a virtual round table to gather evidence from animal welfare organisations about online advertising of the sale of animals. I met with the Dogs Trust, RSPCA, Cats Protection, British Veterinary Association, Kennel Club, and the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) so that I could include their perspective on the aim of the petition.</p>
<p>I held a separate virtual meeting with the petitioner Richard Ackers and learned how he and his family were heartbroken following the death of his puppy Reggie, and he was outraged to find out that there were no regulations covering UK online animal sale advertising, after buying Reggie, who was advertised on an online website from an allegedly reputable seller. Richard set up his petition to prevent others being duped by disreputable sellers. Read the debate <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/159543/regulation-of-online-animal-sales-to-be-debated-by-mps/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I joined the Western Gateway APPG co-chaired by Jess Morden MP and Mark Harper MP for an update on the Western Gateway partnership whose aims are – connecting communities, championing businesses, creating opportunities for sustainable growth, and bringing together businesses, academia, and governments across the River Severn to work together to attract new opportunities for the 4.4 million people living in this region. Its “Step Fusion” bid could provide a near limitless source of low carbon energy that produces four million times more energy than every kilogram of fuel than burning coal, oil, or gas. Fusion doesn’t emit harmful toxins like carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and nuclear fusion reactors provide no high activity, long-lived nuclear waste. It will be situated at Severn Edge because this site once led the world in the development of nuclear power production, is in the levelling-up areas of England and Wales, and close to many Welsh communities identified by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) left-behind index. It can tap into the local massive supply chain, the UK’s National fusion laboratory at Culham, Bristol University high temperature engineering expertise, and nearby R &amp; D facilities. I look forward to the Western Gateway Powerhouse Conference next year.</p>
<p>I attended the APPG for Down Syndrome online meeting following the Second Reading of the Down Syndrome (England) Private Members’ Bill tabled by Liam Fox MP. The APPG was co-chaired by Lisa Cameron MP and Matt Western MP. Liam Fox said that his Bill was in the “Write Around” stage where all UK Government Departments can pledge their support and can add conditions before the Bill goes into committee, where it will be debated and can be amended. Mr Fox hopes that his Bill will pass through the Lords in one day. We heard very powerful, positive, statements from husband and wife, James and Heidi Carter, who support the Bill, and have Down Syndrome. This absolutely charming, happy, couple told us that it “Doesn’t Define Me”. James said that he works hard to support his wife and has a few jobs. Heidi said that James was very handsome, and they love each other very much.</p>
<p>The Co-operative Parliamentary Group met in person on Wednesday afternoon to listen to Rose Marley, CEO of Co-operatives UK, but unfortunately, as soon as the meeting began the division bell, rang summoning MPs to the voting lobby. Consequently, the Co-operative Party Officers Joe Fortune, General Secretary, Emma Hoddinott, Assistant General Secretary, and Rob Bates, Political and Parliamentary Officer, decided that instead of holding a formal meeting, it was turned into a sort of informal drop-in event where MPs called in to speak with Rose and the officers, between the series of votes which lasted most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Chairman of Ways and Means, Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing MP,  who is in charge of the Panel of Parliamentary Chairs convened our Autumn Meeting. We paid tribute to our colleague Sir David Amess MP who was tragically murdered, and held a minute silence. We discussed the forward plan for 2022 covering the responsibilities covered by all the chairs: Public Bill Committees, General Committees, Westminster Hall Debates, and Delegated Legislation Committees. Plus the rules of behaviour and courtesies in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Lord Colin Moynihan co-chair (with the late Sir David Amess) of the APPG for Olympics and Paralympics convened a special AGM of the APPG to pay tribute to Sir David, who, as I have already mentioned, was tragically murdered last month, and to elect a new co-chair to succeed David. I was so proud and honoured to be unanimously elected as co-chair, and pledged to do my very best to continue to work with the members of the APPG in memory of David, who was a dear friend to me, and who helped me so much when I was a newly elected MP. David and I became close friends and we shared a passion for all types of sport. He had a wonderful mischievous nature, a dry sense of humour, and was always happy. David loved to tease me and I miss him more each day.</p>
<p>On Friday, I was back in my constituency at the (socially distanced) switching on of the Melin Christmas Lights at Melin Community Trust, by Neath Town Councillor Keith Finn, who represents the Melyn Ward. There was a good crowd who turned up to support the Trust, and listen to Keith make his debut speech, which was superb. Melin Trust was set up in 2002 to foster community development and regeneration in local areas. It is run by staff, trustees and, over the years, hundreds of volunteers have gained skills and confidence by taking part in the many projects run by the Trust. At the Christmas Lights ceremony, the Trust volunteers handed out mince pies and there was genuine delight at seeing so many old friends in person again after such a long time.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, I joined the virtual meeting of the Wales Co-operative Council to present my report on the work of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. We have continued work on increasing protection for retail workers as they face increasing levels of violence, threats, and abuse at work. The UK Government has finally conceded to our campaign, led in the Commons by Alex Norris MP and his Private Members’ Bill. It will be bringing forward a U.K. Government Lords amendment that gives greater protection for all public-facing workers, including retail workers to the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill, which is currently in the Lords. This has been a core campaign for the Parliamentary Group, the wider Co-operative movement, and trade unions for many years, but we shall continue to press the UK Government to ensure the proposed legislation has the desired positive impact on retail workers.</p>
<p>I have been leading the campaign for the introduction of a UK Marcora Law that would give workers and employees the opportunity, the financial support, and advice, to buy-out all or part of their employer’s business when it is in crisis, and establish it as an employee-owned co-operative. In Italy this is done by giving workers their employment benefits as a lump sum advance to use as capital for the buy-out, plus support and advice from the Cooperazione Finanza Impresa (CFI) which runs Marcora Law on behalf of the Italian Government, to make sure buy-outs are successful. Following my Marcora Law Westminster Hall Debate on 8th September, Camillo De Berardinis Presidente of CFI, contacted me to say that he’d watched my debate and invited me to speak at the CFI’s 35th Anniversary, which I was honoured to accept. I shall continue to press the UK Government to introduce a UK Marcora Law and I have a 10-Minute Rule Bill entitled “Co-operatives (Employee Company Ownership) scheduled in the Commons for 11th January.</p>
<p>We have been actively opposing the sell-off of LV= one of Britain’s oldest and largest customer-owned business. The APPG for Mutuals, chaired by Gareth Thomas MP, of which I am treasurer, conducted an inquiry into the proposed sell-off of LV= and our report stated that the proposed sale to American venture capitalist firm Bain Capital would mean millions of LV= customers losing their ownership rights and ability to have a say in the company’s decisions. I’m pleased to report that LV= members have blocked the takeover, scuppering a year long campaign by the LV= board to secure backing for its preferred bidder Bain. Only 69% of the 174,240 members who cast ballots on 10th December approved of the £530m takeover, but the necessary threshold is 75%. LV= said that it would work swiftly to reassess its options, which could be merging with fellow mutual Royal London, one of the rival bidders, whose initial bid wasn’t accepted by the LV= board, despite being a higher bid at £540m, compared with Bain’s £530m. Gareth called for Chief Executive Mark Hartigan and Chairman Alan Cook to resign immediately. LV= confirmed that Mr Cook would be stepping down, but have not specified a date.</p>
<p>Week beginning 13th December</p>
<p>On Monday 13th I was honoured and privileged to present Reggie’s Law on behalf of the petitioner Richard Ackers, who had been given special permission by the Chair of Ways and Means to be present in the public gallery, because visitors are not allowed on the Parliamentary Estate under current Covid regulations. I told MPs that Richard started the petition after he bought his 12 week old Labrador puppy Reggie through a reputable website for his partner for Christmas and then realised that he had unknowingly contributed to illegal puppy farming. Richard concedes that he should have done more research before buying Reggie, and should have walked away, which would have prevented the seller getting more money to continue with acts of animal cruelty, but Reggie would still have died. Richard gave Reggie love, dignity, and pain relief throughout his very short life. Reggie fell ill 12 hours after Richard took him home and he died from Parvovirus two days later. Richard thought that Reggie was from St Helens, but when he returned to the seller’s address, the house was empty. Richard discovered that the microchip number for Reggie did not match the documentation given to Richard and it was registered to Dublin. Richard thinks Reggie was illegally shipped to the UK. Richard’s petition gathered over 109,000 signatures and many MPs attended the debate to support Reggie’s Law, and tell their stories of their constituents who had been duped by online sellers, plus tragic cases of mistreatment of animals. The UK Government Parliamentary Minister, Under-Secretary of State for Agri-Innovation and Climate Adaption Jo Churchill MP, was very sympathetic and offered to meet Richard. I summed up the debate by thanking all members for their contributions and urged the Minister to legislate to prevent people suffering the heartbreak that Richard has, and I thanked Richard for his determination not to give up on Justice For Reggie.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 14th I spoke in a Westminster Hall Debate on the contribution of co-operative and mutual societies to the economy and public life. I took the opportunity to continue to highlight my campaign to press the UK Government to introduce a UK Marcora Law. I started by reminding members that Robert Owen, founder of our Co-operative movement, whose vision included villages of co-operation, a “New World Order” of mutual help and social equality, was born in Wales, in Newtown, Powys on 14th May 1771. Also that the Co-op Group can trace its roots back to the start of modern co-operation in Rochdale in 1844, and that 177 years later, the Group continues to put its members and their passions at the centre of its business with a focus on working with others – co-operating. And since it’s launch in 2016, the Group’s Local Community Fund has provided approaching £100m to over 20,000 local good causes, making it one of the largest funding mechanisms for charities in the UK. I told the Minister that too much power and wealth rest with a small number of investors, shareholders, and executives and that decisions are often made for the benefit of the powerful and wealthy, not for the benefit of communities, workers, consumers, and the environment. And that I believe the answer lies in Marcora Law. I referred to my Westminster Hall Debate on 8th September and provided Minister John Glen MP with more facts about the success of the Italian New Marcora Law operated by the CFI, but the Minister repeated his comments that he made in my debate, that the Italian economy is different to the UK, And the unemployment rate is higher in Italy.</p>
<p>But the Minister did offer to meet me to discuss Marcora Law, and I have written to him to request a meeting in the New Year.</p>
<p>As the vice-chair for the APPG Rail in Wales, I was delighted to be asked to chair the Zoom meeting to discuss “Women in Rail” (WIR) with guest speakers Christine Fernandez, Development Lead CAF and chair of WIR Wales, and Gemma Southgate, Social Media Manager TfW and committee member of WIR Wales. Christine and Gemma gave a joint presentation about the aims and objectives of WIR Wales, the role of women in rail, and the need for more women to work in a variety of roles across the rail sector. There are only 13% women in the Rail sector, and only 2-3% are drivers. Women in Rail was set up to create various initiatives to encourage more women to join the sector, including a mentoring programme, upskilling, a peer to peer network for senior women in rail, an EDI Charter, and has plans to engage with schools, colleges and apprenticeships.</p>
<p>As a member of the Panel of Chairs, I chaired Westminster Hall Debates on both Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday Sir Tony Lloyd MP, former Shadow Northern Ireland Shadow Cabinet Minister, led a debate on securing a veterinary agreement in the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sir Tony opened by taking us back to two years ago quoting Prime Minister Johnson who said about form-filling “tell them to ring up the Prime Minister and I will direct them to throw the form in the bin….there will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind. You will have unfettered access.” Sir Tony said that his debate was about the operation of the protocol, and it is irresponsible that two years on we have no solution, which is building up tensions and concerns in Northern Island. Sir Tony stated that we need to move on – to some form of trusted trader scheme.</p>
<p>The next debate was led by Ruth Cadbury MP and was about the Free Period Product Scheme for Schools and College in England. Ruth is chair of the APPG on Period Equality, and she welcomed the UK Government’s announcement on 26th November to extend the scheme for all of 2022. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education, Will Quince, responded by stating that people may think “what does this middle-aged bloke know or care about period products?” But he does care because he is passionate about ensuring that women and girls are supported in education and beyond.</p>

<p>On Thursday I chaired a three hour Back Bench Debate about preventing surgical fires in the NHS led by Jim Shannon MP who underlined the serious dangers of surgical fires to patients and clinicians. A surgical fire occurs in an operating theatre and has three elements: the ignition source, the fuel and the oxidiser. Ignition sources include electro-surgical units, fibre-optic light sources, and lasers. Fuels can be alcohol-based skin prepping agents used in excess. The oxidiser is an oxygen-rich environment in which nitrous oxide is also present.</p>
<p>Mr Shannon stated that the debate was about raising awareness and making sure that surgical fires no longer happen. Mr Shannon stated that nobody knows how common surgical fires are, because there is a large discrepancy between reporting across the UK and health is devolved. The UK Government accept there is an issue but they do not know the scale of the problem, because they are not monitoring or reporting surgical fires, but there is also a need for education and training. There is currently no national guidance or safety recommendations to prevent surgical fires in operating theatres. And surgical fires must become a “never event”. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maria Caulfield MP, responded on behalf of the NHS in England, and stated that she was concerned that there is no central record of how many surgical fires are taking place, agreed that staff training is a priority, and offered to meet Mr Shannon to look at guidelines to make sure they come forward, because surgical fires can not become “never events” without national guidance or safety recommendations. The Minister ended by stating that she hopes to share some progress with members in the new year.</p>

<p>My week ended when I attended the Advent 4 service at St David’s Church in Neath, and as usual I was given the warmest welcome. Reverend Stuart Ghezzi gave a wonderful sermon about the importance that greetings play in our life, and how we have adapted our greetings in Covid times. It was so good to see Neath Benefice Secretary Helen, Rector’s Warden Paul, and many members of the congregation who have become dear friends over the many years that I have been a member of Neath Benefice. Many thanks go to Canon Rector Linda Newman for doing a wonderful job at leading the Neath Benefice during such challenging times.</p>
<p>May I wish you all the happiest Christmas and my very best wishes for 2022.</p>

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients. You can find further information about the vaccination programme on the NHS website. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccination-programme/?fbclid=IwAR1fpUmKNp4yRr6QmFb7LJiCh5LvoLTJx6-Qah39dx87VAq6ASeUi1ZiApM" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/…/covid-19-vaccination…/</a>This is more progress on the path to recovery and a bit of good news as we keep up the fight against C-19. </p>

    <title>£50 million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire to level up education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2021/12/17/50-million-funding-boost-for-schools-in-lincolnshire-to-level-up-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Schools in Lincolnshire will receive £50million in extra funding next year, as part of a £4 billion funding boost from the Conservative Government across the country.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funding per pupil will increase nationally by five per cent in real terms from next year, giving significant increases for every pupil in every school.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A record £1 billion extra will be spent to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, so that all young people can reach their full potential.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that schools in Lincolnshire will receive £648 million in funding next year, a boost of £50million as part of the Conservative Government’s £4 billion increase in spending for schools across the country.</p>
<p>The £4 billion extra funding for school delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment when entering Downing Street, when he pledged to level up school funding by pledging over £14 billion for primary and secondary schools by 2022-23.</p>
<p>The £50million extra funding can use for hiring specialist teachers, providing training, and purchasing school supplies including textbooks.</p>
<p>The total extra funding for schools means mainstream schools will receive £41.7 billion in 2022-23, an increase of 5.8 per cent per pupil. Every primary school will receive at least £4,362 per pupil, and every secondary school at least £5,669 per pupil.</p>
<p>Matt Warman has also commended the Conservative Government’s targeted £1 billion boost to funding for special educational needs and disabilities, which is a record 13 per cent increase on this year’s funding.</p>
<p>The extra funding will help schools, councils, and other specialist providers provide the right care and support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities – so that every child receives the help they need to learn and fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>The increases in school funding follows the investment of nearly £5 billion in education recovery, which includes £1.5 billion on tutoring in schools and colleges across the country to help children and young people catch up on lost learning during the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<p>“No child or young person should be limited by where they grow up – they should be supported to get a world class education at school.</p>
<p>“The £50million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire will help them to hire more teachers, get materials to support pupils learning, and support pupils with special needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>“As we build back fairer, this funding will ensure every young person can receive the education they deserve so they can fulfil their potential.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Schools Minister Robin Walker said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Every pupil, no matter where they grow up or go to school, deserves an excellent education and the chance to fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>“This £4 billion funding boost delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment to level up school funding – giving significant increases to every pupil in every school – and taken alongside our ambitious education recovery plan with additional investment of almost £5 billion, will support every young person to catch up following the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This additional investment also represents a significant boost to high needs funding, helping local authorities support pupils with special educational needs, and helping to ensure all young people can thrive and succeed.”</p></blockquote>

    <title>Votes on Covid Measures</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/12/17/votes-on-covid-measures/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I have received a large volume of emails in connection with the further restrictions covering a range of views and suggestions and the Government had repeatedly amended the format of the vote which took place on Tuesday evening. I have noted the contents of every email when forming my view and hope to set out below how I voted on each aspect.</p>
<p><strong>A. Face Coverings in a list of indoor venues </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the re-imposition of masks and face coverings in most settings for those who are able to wear them. There is evidence to suggest that masks are effective in reducing the spread of airborne based viruses and the wearing of masks is uncomfortable at worst for the vast majority of people. If masks provide any protection at all, they are worth persevering with and I was concerned and disappointed to see the Government abandon this mandate earlier in the year, especially when it comes to public transport. I therefore voted in favour of this measure.</p>
<p><strong>B. Self Isolation Changes (Using lateral flow tests instead of isolation for vaccinated contacts of Covid-19 cases) </strong></p>
<p>Quite recently to Government announced that they would be returning to fixed isolation for all contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19 where it is suspected that the positive case was the new omicron variant. The Government then proposed to move away from this to allow those who are vaccinated to continue to take daily lateral flow tests in lieu of isolation.</p>
<p>In my view, as I will set out in greater detail below, the early data suggests that while maximum vaccination provides ample protection against symptoms and illness associated with the omicron variant of Covid-19, there is little data to suggest that the vaccination reduces transmission of the variant. As such, I feel that a negative lateral flow test provides at least a degree of certainty that the virus is not present, and as such this should be sufficient to allow people to continue normal life. I would add that should any person have any symptoms whatsoever, they must seek a PCR test as soon as possible and isolate until they receive their results.</p>
<p><strong> C. Covid Status Certification </strong></p>
<p>I’m fundamentally opposed to any certification programme which does not allow for those who have not been, or can not be vaccinated from obtaining the certification required to access venues and events accordingly. Additionally, I’m opposed to the introduction of any certificate based entry system without the subsequent evidence to show that it would be effective, how it would be effective and why it is necessary.</p>
<p>At present, the data appears to show that while the omicron variant is highly transmissible, vaccination status does not appear to provide any or much protection against transmission and the Government have continued to ignore calls to produce the evidence required to show that this type of scheme would be effective. As a starting point, the Government have failed to convince me, through data, that a scheme to restrict entry based largely on vaccination status is an effective public health measure. I was pleased to see the option to complete a lateral flow test instead, and would have ordinarily been more inclined to support such a scheme on this basis, but for the two issues set out below.</p>
<p>First, it can not be right to bring in a form of certification like this which allows for individuals to satisfy the criteria through the completion of a LFT, on the same week where it would appear almost impossible to obtain LFT devices. Such a scheme in these circumstances, therefore, becomes an actual vaccine passport, which I fundamentally oppose.</p>
<p>Second, even if the distribution of LFT devices was to be resolved, I can not in good conscience vote in favour of a scheme which places huge constraints on the hospitality sector in particular, and larger venues who have been the hardest hit since March 2020; without any discernible support through either financial backing or infrastructure, during the busiest period of the year for many of these businesses.</p>
<p>Without the data to back up such a scheme and show its effectiveness, without proper support for the businesses and employees who are being forced to administer this scheme and without ready access to LFT devices, I felt that I could not support this introduction.</p>
<p>However, should the above be satisfied, I would be happy to support such a scheme in the future and for this reason, I abstained.</p>
<p><strong>D. Extension of Mandatory Vaccination for NHS and Care Workers</strong></p>
<p>I’m generally opposed to mandatory vaccination schemes across society, especially where measures can be introduced to placate the need for vaccinations.</p>
<p>In this instance, as referred to above, it is not clear that vaccinations help prevent transmission of the latest variant to any notable degree, and as such, I’m concerned that vaccination status alone is providing false reassurance of safety. I understand that the alternative plans would be to continue to test through both LFT and PCR all staff who are working in and around the health and care sectors and I completely agree with this. It is imperative that we protect those who are most vulnerable and the best way to do that is to ensure that every precaution is taken to prevent the virus being transmitted from staff to patients. Given the current data, I would think this would be much better achieved through testing than vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we are already facing huge vacancy numbers across the health and care sector at a time where both services are under excessive strain. It would be the worst possible time to lose further staff through a scheme of this nature. I could not, therefore, support this action.</p>
<p>I hope the above sets out my view on the most recent vote in Parliament.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I am increasingly concerned at public health pronouncements made in the media that already seem to exceed or contradict decisions made by our elected representatives. 
Expert advice is important but decisions must be made by those we elect, who are democratically accountable.

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-39/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>I know that there are strong views on both sides of the argument about the new restrictions, but for the purposes of this message I thought it just helpful to explain what is now required.</p>
<p>There are three major changes in effect from now for the next few weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face coverings are required by law in most indoor settings outside the home. This does not apply to hospitality settings where you are eating or drinking.</li>
<li>People who can work from home are now being asked to do so.</li>
<li>From today, certain venues and events will be required by law to check that all visitors aged 18 years or over are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative test in the last 48 hours, or have an exemption. This includes nightclubs and big sporting and entertainment events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Isolation</h2>
<p>The self-isolation requirements have also changed. If you test positive for Covid you are still required to isolate for a period of ten days, even if you do not have symptoms. But if you live with or come into contact with someone who tests positive, you do not have to isolate but are instead asked to take a daily lateral flow test to continue to check that you are not positive yourself.</p>
<h2>Travel to Africa</h2>
<p>For those seeking to travel to parts of Africa, the system of hotel quarantine has now been scrapped. Everyone travelling abroad is still required to take a lateral flow or PCR test before their return to the UK, and is required to take a PCR test on their return and to isolate until they get the (hopefully negative) result. You then only need to carry on isolating if the test is positive.</p>
<p>All the latest details and guidance can be found <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#what-has-changed">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Lateral Flow Tests</h2>
<p>I know that there have been some issues locally with the supply of home tests. I have spoken to local pharmacists and ministers about this, and there is no overall shortage of the tests, though the sudden increase in demand means that there has been a problem getting the tests distributed quickly enough. Hopefully that is on the way to being resolved.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 Booster Programme</h2>
<p>Most people over the age of 50 have now had their booster jabs in our area, but the expansion of the booster programme to all other adults means a significant increase in the demand locally and it will take a bit of time for the local health service to get all of this sorted. I would like to extend my thanks to all of those involved in the programme and particularly to people who have come forward this week to volunteer to help accelerate the programme.</p>
<p>I will continue to provide updates as and when I have more information that I hope will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

    <title>Give our forces a fighting chance </title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Tuesday 14 December, Preet Kaur Gill MP has opened a debate in the House of Commons to challenge the Government on funding for neighbourhood policing and its fair funding across the West Midlands.</p>
<p>In her speech she called on the Government to give local Police forces a fighting chance of tackling crime following 11 years of Conservative Government cuts to the West Midlands which has seen more than 2,220 officers lose their jobs, a further £175 million of funding removed from West Midlands Police’s budget and more than 20 Police stations earmarked for closure.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “We’ve seen how crime across Birmingham and the West Midlands has increased dramatically over the last decade, and I worry about the future of policing should this continue. With these dramatic cuts to our neighbourhood policing, it comes as no surprise that the West Midlands has the fourth highest rate of crime in the country, and it is residents that are feeling the impact and are being let down when they most need help.</p>
<p>“Neighbourhood policing is all about preventing crime and building relationships in the communities where officers serve. However, the direct result of these funding cuts means that West Midlands Police are operating on a reactive basis.  Across Birmingham, we’re seeing neighbourhood Police officers coming off shift at 11pm which means the safety of the whole city is left to central response. If you’re one of my constituents in Bartley Green or Quinton and are in a life-threatening situation, because you are so far out from the city centre, that’s at best a 15-minute wait. It simply isn’t good enough.”</p>
<p>This approach also has an impact on prosecution rates. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of crimes that end in a charge or court summons has halved, with justice for victims of violent offences at an even worse rate.</p>
<p>Gill continued, “Ultimately, all of this means that West Midlands Police can’t meet the demands for its services in protecting vulnerable people with the resources it has. That isn’t right and is why I’m proud to work alongside our PCC Simon Foster and my parliamentary colleagues to prioritise police officers, because it is police officers that keep you and your family safe. I hope this debate brings this disastrous approach to light and to fight for a policing service that is fit for the future.”</p>
<p>The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster said, "Reckless government cuts have dismantled neighbourhood policing, with numbers dropping in the West Midlands from 1,821 in 2010 to 760 in 2018. That was a big mistake. It was counter-productive and a false economy. We have all been being paying the price with less justice, safety and security. This is why I have launched a cross-party campaign for a fair funding deal for West Midlands Police to help us get officer numbers back to 2010 levels.</p>
<p>"My core mission during my term of office will be to rebuild community policing. Community policing is the bedrock of British policing. It embodies the principle of policing by consent on which policing in our country is built. It provides the preventative, proactive, problem solving and visible policing that the people and communities of the West Midlands want.</p>
<p>"I will begin the crucial work of rebuilding it to keep people, their families and communities safe. As a start, on my mission to rebuild community policing, I will aim to put 450 additional officers into neighbourhood policing, strengthening the local bonds between the public and the police and improving our ability to proactively solve local issues before they become critical. Much more government support is needed to get back to the community policing levels we had a decade ago."</p>

    <title>Morrisons Foundation Cash boost for Buttershaw Group</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Judith was delighted to hear that local Bradford South charity Sandale Trust has received funding from Morrison&amp;#8217;s Foundation to support their community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding will help the Sandale Community Development Trust, based in Buttershaw,&amp;nbsp;to offer twice-weekly drop-in sessions at their community hub for residents who have been experiencing isolation, helping them to meet other people and offering the opportunity to gain new life skills and take part in volunteering roles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Training courses will also be available on first aid and mental health awareness, providing users with skills that build confidence and will have a lasting impact long after the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The team at Sandale Trust work at the heart of the community in Buttershaw and Woodside and offer a wide range of community activities that put people first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Through the pandemic, their efforts to provide free school meals, food parcels, and work with isolated members in our community has been a lifeline for many and has doubtless saved lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Supported by this Morrisons Foundation grant, they are now leading the way locally in helping hard-hit families as we recover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was delighted to endorse their application, which will see Sandale provide space, support and training to bring residents together and build resilience in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can read the full story on the &lt;a href="https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/19774624.cash-boost-lifeline-buttershaw-group/"&gt;Telegraph &amp;amp; Argus website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

    <title>Emma Leads a Debate on Sewage Pollution in Whitburn</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-leads-a-debate-on-sewage-pollution-in-whitburn/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>



<p>You can read my full speech <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-10-27/debates/2FE67ECE-5C5C-4910-876B-9610627E645A/SewagePollutionWhitburn">here.</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
