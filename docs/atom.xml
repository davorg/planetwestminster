    <title>The balance between spending and taxing</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2023/03/12/the-balance-between-spending-and-taxing/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are stories in the press suggesting the Chancellor will have some scope to boost spending or cut taxes in the budget. There are also suggestions that boosting spending will take priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be good first to create more room to make changes. We read work on getting more people into jobs is going well. If more people take up paid employment benefit and tax credit spending falls and tax revenues rise. The inflation rate is coming down, so  they need to put a large saving on debt interest into  the figures. Last year debt interest on their accounting basis soared thank to the large rise in inflation linked debt costs. There will be big savings on the energy package which should be allowed to run off this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are comments that defence will get some more money. It needs to restock ammunition and weapons to replace that sent to Ukraine.It needs to get up to strength on personnel numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS will need help with meeting the  extra pay bills. It also needs to review it current spending priorities and see where the large  increases of the last three years have gone.Childcare may need expansion as part of the workforce package. There is talk of more energy subsidy than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital there is scope for tax cuts. Some of these will boost revenues though OBR forecasts will say otherwise. Without more growth we will struggle to afford good public services. High  tax rates can induce a cycle of decline by deterring enterprise and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span><span>Having been a leading figure calling for a proper offshore solution over several years, I recognise that the East Anglia Green proposals put forward by National Grid (although not directly impacting upon Mid Norfolk) are a big part of that wider campaign. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why I added my name to the letter submitted to my former BEIS colleague the Energy Minister by OffSET MPs last summer criticising the lack of proper public consultation conducted by National Grid over the EAG plans (see more </span></span><a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/news/offshore-wind-infrastructure-7"><span>here</span></a><span><span>) – and why I now welcome the news that National Grid ESO have listened to the concerns of MPs and campaigners and are now launching a review that will consider “offshore routes” for energy transmission in our region as well.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>As has been widely publicised in recent years, the East is at the forefront of the offshore wind revolution that is already strengthening our UK energy resilience and driving forward the decarbonisation of our energy network. However, our region must have a proper say in how the necessary infrastructure is delivered, with all of the available options up for consideration.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>As local MPs, we disagreed with National Grid’s assertion that they DID properly consult the public on whether or not this infrastructure should go ahead onshore (with new pylons running from Norwich to Tilbury) or be included in an offshore solution. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The news of this review is therefore a positive step in the right direction and I would encourage all of my constituents to take the time to have their say.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to work with parliamentary colleagues and local campaigners on this key campaign.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>MPs have more in common, in terms of their values and seeking to improve the lives of those they represent, than divides them.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There is widespread consensus that we all want to see our rivers and waterways in a healthy state, with clear water providing a healthy habitat and a safe environment for recreation.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This was especially so when I launched a Private Members Bill three years ago to highlight the parlous state of our rivers and the need to clean them up by cutting sewage and other pollutants. I was supported by politicians on all sides.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I have been campaigning on the issue of sewage discharges ever since. I have made it my mission to continue to do so.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There has been an attempt by some political parties to weaponise this issue. Unbelievably in our social media age this has led to death threats to MPs! Politicians need to work together rather than making reckless claims.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I have consistently acted, and voted in Parliament, including against my party whip, on measures to improve our rivers. Earlier this year I voted for new and tougher interim targets for water quality to reduce phosphates and nitrates in waterways, which the Opposition voted against.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I led the Environmental Audit Committee inquiry into water quality in our rivers which reported a year ago. It recommended a host of measures, several of which were included in the Environment Act going through Parliament at the same time, including the requirement to increase monitoring.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Last week Shrewsbury Town Council discussed what could be done to improve the condition of the River Severn. A start is being made in the catchment by Severn Trent Water's Get River Positive project. This aims to secure bathing water quality status for the River Teme upstream and downstream from South Shropshire, where £4.5m is being spent over the next two years to improve treatment and cut discharges. A key start has been made by installing monitors at 19 points along the Teme to establish the condition of the river.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The BBC’s programme last weekend highlighted the horrors of sewage discharges to a wider audience. Most of those Paul Whitehouse interviewed had given evidence to our Committee. The greater awareness of the problem has been enabled from introduction of Event Duration Monitors, which this Government required water companies to install in recent years, these monitors have brought this previously hidden practice into the open since the first data on discharges was published three years ago.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Water companies have now been required to invest £56b in improving treatment over the next 25 years. I am delighted that one of the first places to benefit will be the River Teme here in Shropshire.</span></span></span></p></div>

<p>The Works and Pensions Select Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into jobs. There are three main issues.: shortages in key areas affecting growth and outcomes, too few people with the right skills, and deprivation which limits opportunity.</p>



<p>Our inquiry is considering how other countries are dealing with these problems. One of our biggest concerns is the shortage and future shortfall of nurses and other NHS staff.</p>



<p>Labour has rightly identified training more doctors and nurses as a key priority and will pay for it by taxing non-doms, rich people who enjoy the benefits of living in our country but avoid paying tax. However, the inquiry has led me to conclude that, vital though that is, it won’t be enough.</p>



<p>In the USA, which has quite a different health and care system, they are experiencing remarkably similar problems over recruitment and retention of nurses. President Biden’s administration is embarking on an ambitious apprenticeship scheme to encourage new nurses. They’ll be paid apprentices from day one, so no loans and no debt, such a deterrent to those from poorer backgrounds, especially after our government scrapped bursaries for student nurses. There aren’t enough training places for the number of nurses needed. The Americans plan to tackle that by recruiting experienced nurses as trainers and mentors, which also addresses retention issues caused by experienced nurses leaving the profession through excessive pressure and lack of job satisfaction.</p>



<p>It’s an obvious way to encourage new recruits and reduce prohibitive entry requirements. Like other apprenticeships, it will largely consist of on-the-job training, often thought to be lacking in current programmes. It’s a wonderful opportunity to increase the number of nurses in our hospitals. No doubt we’ll hear some opposition or claims that there’s already an apprenticeship route, but I’m talking about something much bigger and a programme that’s much more accessible. I want a modern version of the old pupil nurse route.</p>



<p>We need to make it easier for people, especially those from disadvantaged areas, to enter the profession. We need a modern health service but, like matrons, we need apprentice/pupil nurses as part of that modern NHS.</p>

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-11/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with a further update about a number of local matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epsom &amp;amp; Ewell Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a reminder about the deadline for the consultation on the local plan for Epsom and Ewell Borough. You have until March 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to take part in the consultation and to give your view about what is proposed. It is really important that everyone takes part, as the plan is highly controversial and involves developing a large area of green belt land in Epsom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan includes building 1500 homes on the Horton Farm site, the area of farmland between Horton Lane and Hook Road, building residential blocks on the playing fields next to Ewell East station and building homes on part of the Hook Road arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have submitted a response which continues to argue for the redevelopment of the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas as a mixed use area. This could provide more homes than the Council’s plans for local green belt. Contrary to what some of you may have heard, the outline plan also envisages retaining the same amount of commercial space as at present. All the details are on my website &lt;a href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/shaping-the-right-plan-for-epsom-and-ewell-a-proposal-from-chris-grayling/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also going to be a special Council meeting about the plan on &lt;strong&gt;March 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Although I imagine that the public gallery will be packed, you will also be able to watch the meeting online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of how to respond to the consultation are at &lt;a href="http://www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk"&gt;www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; . Information about how to log in and watch the Council meeting will be on the website at this address a few days before the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://democracy.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=146&amp;amp;MId=1462&amp;amp;Ver=4"&gt;https://democracy.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=146&amp;amp;MId=1462&amp;amp;Ver=4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mole Valley Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who live in Mole Valley, the latest on its local plan is that the process has been paused to wait for the revised national policy on green belt land. I spoke at the planning enquiry and asked for a reduction to the amount of green belt land proposed for development in Ashtead. I hope that when the new policy is launched the plan will be modified accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ewell East Train Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people have been in touch with me about the reduction in train services at Ewell East. I have been pursuing this with Southern, and they have agreed to restore the half hourly service at peak times. This will mean six additional trains stopping at Ewell East when the new timetable starts in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are still issues around crowding on the Waterloo line and I am continuing to push on this. The arrival of the new ten coach trains, which is due this year, will I hope make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horton &amp;#8211; Local Centre Parking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of people have raised concerns with me about the way that the car park is being operated at the Horton local centre, with complaints about the way that people are being penalised for visiting the shops. I have raised concerns with the owners of the site, and they have agreed to improve the signage so that it is much clearer which spaces are available for shoppers. I would still advise taking care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Veterans Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a former member of the armed forces, I have been asked to let you know that there is an active and growing veterans group locally. It organises a range of activities for veterans, and all are welcome to join. If you are interested please contact Barb Warwich of the local branch of the British Legion, &lt;a href="mailto:barb.warwick@virginmedia.com"&gt;barb.warwick@virginmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Age Concern Volunteers Needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been asked by the local Age Concern team to let you know that they are in need of both volunteer drivers, and also people who are interested in joining their Trustee board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers are needed to take older people from the Borough of Epsom and Ewell to medical appointments, or to visit family of friends in hospital or residential homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a regular weekly commitment or on an ad-hoc basis.  A mileage allowance of 50p per mile is paid and they will need to undertake a DBS clearance for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role is of interest or if you would like more information, please contact Jane Hodgson, Volunteer Co-ordinator on 01372 728458 or by email &lt;a href="mailto:jane.hodgson@ageconcernepsom.org.uk"&gt;jane.hodgson@ageconcernepsom.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Trustee Roles they would particularly like to hear from you if you have a background in law, business strategy, marketing, fundraising, or social care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, please send a copy of your current CV along with a covering letter detailing your skills, experience and motivation for applying to Dorah May Hancock, Chief Officer, Age Concern Epsom and Ewell by email to &lt;a href="mailto:dorahmay.hancock@ageconcernepsom.org.uk"&gt;dorahmay.hancock@ageconcernepsom.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; or contact her on 01372 732458 for an informal discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Councillor Sam Webster’s final speech</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/03/09/councillor-sam-websters-final-speech/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Councillor Sam Webster has given many speeches at full council over his years as a councillor. These speeches have raised the issues that many in Nottingham have faced, what Nottingham Labour is doing to help solve these and frequently taken the Tory government and its failures to task. This is the case of Cllr Webster’s last speech which focused on the failure and empty rhetoric of the Conservatives levelling up. The speech in full is below:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bigpic-6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bigpic-6.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2567"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Councillor Sam Webster&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Levelling Up&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Very laudable statement of intent&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Who could disagree with that? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;unfortunately the current Prime Minister has in fact stated that he disagrees with the ambition to Level Up. He must be one of only a few people in Britain who doesn’t see the need to direct investment and resources to those parts of the country where it’s needed most. Where investment would have most impact, those left behind areas where we all know there is so much potential and talent going to waste. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I was thinking about my contribution to this debate today part of me thought shouldn’t I just let the Prime Minister say what he believes and what he has done since he’s been in a position of political power.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I managed to start changing the funding formulas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We inherited a bunch of formulas from the Labour Party, which shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That needed to be undone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I started the work of undoing that”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rishi Sunak, Summer 2022. Just a few months ago!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We should all remember his words, because he meant them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when we think of what he said and what he stands for and what he believes &amp;#8211; we therefore shouldn’t be at all surprised when Nottingham is refused a single penny of Levelling Up funding as it was in the most recent round of allocations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t be surprised when the midlands and the north, and when the poorest areas of the country and when the areas with the greatest need are refused new investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t be surprised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we should be outraged. All of us who care about our city, our neighbourhoods, our region. Councillors, MPs, residents, business owners and leaders, local journalists. We should all be outraged because as this motion described the process of allocating money isn’t fair, it isn’t transparent, it isn’t adequate and it isn’t fit for purpose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It isn’t built on sound policy. levelling Up was always a political slogan. An electioneering slogan put to good use by the Conservative Party as something that sounds good to people and is something most people want to see happen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But levelling up is a political slogan, not a policy of Government. Policy would require specific measurable and tangible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And because levelling up is a political slogan rather than a policy it’s not surprising that the whole process and method had become highly politicised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Money is awarded in a political fashion, so you get these decisions to award £19m to Rishi Sunak’s wealthy Richmond constituency when other areas with an extreme need for investment and a business case based on productivity to back up that need, lose out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are so many reasons why genuine Levelling Up is needed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;why a genuine plan and policy to increase investment and start to generate economic growth beyond the South East , higher productivity, higher levels of skills is needed. So many reasons why both economic and social.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the truth is it isn’t happening. In fact on most key indicators the country is going in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I can reel off a whole list of indicators where the Government is not only failing to deliver on its Levelling Up slogan, but is failing to deliver on the fundamentals of Government, its core duty to improve people’s lives in this country, to improve improve our prospects, to prepare us better for the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Economy &amp;#8211; OECD expects the UKs performance over the next 2 years to be the worst of all major advanced economies. While growth is predicted in The United States, the EU as a whole and Japan, no growth is predicted for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lack of any industrial strategy. No meaningful link between education, schools, colleges and the needs of businesses, the growth areas of the future, the very visible skills shortages we have bursting out all over, in a while range of sectors from health, to technology to hospitality to construction and logistics. There is no plan and we can see businesses and employers becoming more and more agitated, but also far too many young people not being given the chance to fulfil their potential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember &amp;#8211; left behind places means left behind people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a short-termism in Government and all too often in corporate culture and that short termism comes from the top. 3 Prime Ministers in a matter of months, need I say more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transport infrastructure falling behind our global comparator countries (you only have to look at our railways to see the problem very clearly)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; expensive (6% increase on fares implemented today)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unreliable&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unclean&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp; inefficient and slow&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Frankly an embarrassment for a country that once led the world on rail travel&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lack of a plan or the required targeted investment in public health with dire consequences for people and places across the country. Official statistics now show clear trends that in the poorest parts of the UK life expectancy has been falling. The first time this has happened in modern times and a phenomenon that isn’t happening in other similar countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And of course the policies of this Government for 13 years have decimated local areas, local public services. You can’t genuinely level up on one off capital investment. What’s needed is a new social and economic contract with people. What’s needed is sustained, targeted investment based on need and based on achieving key outcomes &amp;#8211; better health, more good jobs, a cleaner environment, good quality housing….&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Labour Council’s have so often been the last line of defence when it comes to children’s centres, libraries, local swimming pools, housing standards, affordable public transport…..but as we all know, as my colleagues all painfully know, such has been the scale of the onslaught from Conservatives in Government over such a prolonged period we’ve at times been practically forced to doing things that none of us came into politics to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sadly I think our requests set out in the motion will go unheard, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t&amp;nbsp; try.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is my firm belief that only a change in Government will change the course of the country. A change in course that is, as each day goes by becoming more and more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our country desperately needs a fresh start. Only a general election can offer that fresh start.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Isles MP piles further pressure on UK Gov to increase Rural Fuel Rebate at next week’s Spring Budget</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is piling further pressure on the UK Government to increase the Rural Fuel Rebate at next week’s Spring Budget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id="4086" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2023/02/02/even-more-people-in-na-h-eileanan-an-iar-see-brexit-as-a-mistake/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f/" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg" data-orig-size="1280,960" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-4086" srcset="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=150 150w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=300 300w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg?w=768 768w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/thumbnail_fa0b7152-7ef9-4d02-80d3-ab63746e588f.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, Mr MacNeil is pressing once again for an increase in the Rural Fuel Rebate from 5p a litre to 10p a litre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Rural Fuel Rebate was introduced in 2012 after many years of heavy lobbying by Mr MacNeil and others to take 5p off a litre of fuel in island and other rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil wrote to the then Chancellor Rishi Sunak in March last year calling for an increase to the Rural Fuel Rebate from 5p a litre to 10p a litre and the response received from Helen Whately, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, confirmed that there are no plans to change the Rural Fuel Rebate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With additional pressures placed on households in the islands, Mr MacNeil is reiterating this call once again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “I had asked the Chancellor to increase the Rural Fuel Rebate from 5p a litre to 10p a litre in March last year, but this request was woefully brushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rather than taking action to help families, the Tories choose to make the rich richer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Scotland is an energy-rich country but sadly being in the UK we are not getting the benefits of our vast resources.&amp;nbsp; The UK is hampering and harming Scotland and only with independence can we get out of this mess.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil is also supporting calls from the Road Hauliers Association (RHA) for an Essential User Rebate of 15p per litre which has been introduced in many European nations including Ireland, France, Italy and Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ALMOST HALF OF WEST DUNBARTONSHIRE HOUSEHOLDS WORRY ABOUT ENERGY BILLS</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://martindocherty.scot/2023/03/09/almost-half-of-west-dunbartonshire-households-worry-about-energy-bills/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has called on the UK government to act over concerns about the impact of the cost-of-living crisis in West Dunbartonshire.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://costoflivingmap.com/data/">new survey</a>, almost half (46%) of households in West Dunbartonshire say they can’t afford to turn the heating on during cold weather.</p>



<p>Research commissioned by campaign group 38Degrees on the cost-of-living crisis also shows that 35% fear they may have to use a foodbank due to soaring bills. 1 in 5 (20%) of households in Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale also say they have missed a rent payment in the past six months.</p>



<p>Ahead of next week’s spring budget, the area’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes is challenging the UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to do more to help struggling families.</p>



<p>The SNP is calling for a comprehensive budget package to boost household incomes and tackle soaring energy bills.</p>



<p>The call comes as new <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/23363696.scots-set-pay-1000-rest-uk-energy-bills/">research</a> reveals Scots face paying the highest energy bills in the UK, with the typical household in Scotland having to fork out close to £3,500 a year in energy bills.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“These stark figures underline the difficulties facing struggling households in West Dunbartonshire as the UK government fails to get a grip of the cost-of-living crisis.</p>



<p>“It’s outrageous that in energy-rich Scotland my constituents can’t afford to heat their homes. Westminster control of the energy market is allowing energy companies to rake in billions while families here are forced into foodbanks.</p>



<p>“My call to the Chancellor for the upcoming spring budget is simple – put money back into people’s pockets and stop ripping off hard-working households.</p>



<p>“The Prime Minister and his Chancellor need to recognise the financial pressures facing households in West Dunbartonshire and across the country.</p>



<p>“If they fail to deliver the support families need then it shows once again that only independence can secure the real change Scotland needs.”</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-87/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">The week started with the very sad news that the former <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1630218007015223297?cxt=HHwWgsCz6fuo2Z8tAAAA">first female Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, Betty Boothroyd had passed away on Sunday 26th February. Betty was a remarkable woman, who was firm but fair, and presided over many very important historic debates in the Chamber, including the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. Betty became a Baroness in 2001, and sat as a crossbench peer, which is the convention for former Speakers. I had the honour to meet Betty when she was Madam Speaker, and when I became an MP in 2015 I spoke to Betty on many occasions when she was in the tea room. Betty commanded massive admiration, huge respect, and her contribution to democracy will never diminish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended many events this week, which started with the excellent Bevan Foundation and Cost of Living Crisis Briefing event that focused on the housing crisis. Wales is in the middle of a housing and cost of living crisis, greater numbers of households are struggling to live. The Bevan Foundation has researched the role that the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) plays in creating and perpetuating homelessness and housing insecurity in Wales. The LHA is the mechanism used to calculate the amount of Housing Benefit or housing element of Universal Credit (UC) that someone renting in the private rental sector is entitled to claim. The determining factors are: allowing a tenant to rent in the cheapest 30% of a market area; the location of the property (there are 23 Broad Rental Market Areas in Wales); the number of bedrooms; and a separate calculation for shared properties for under 35s with no dependents. The Bevan Foundation’s latest findings show that only 24 properties were available at or below the LHA in May 2022 in Wales and the situation has significantly worsened since 2022, which makes the need for the UK Government to take action to uprate the LHA – whose rates have been frozen since 2020 and does not reflect the rise in rental costs since 2020 – which is absolutely crucial to improve the rental market in Wales. I have been a member of the Bevan Foundation for many years, and support the marvellous research work that they do to highlight the crises facing many families and individuals in Wales. I fully support campaigning for the UK Government to reform the LHA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every year I attend the drop-in for <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1631217783378780161?cxt=HHwWgoC9mc77n6MtAAAA">World Book Day</a>, whose mission is to offer every child and young person the opportunity to read and love books by giving free books to children so that they have a book of their own. When children read in their spare time they are happier, improve reading skills, and are more successful in school. Adults are encouraged to help children by reading to them, having books at home, letting children choose what they want to read, making time for reading and most of all, making it fun. Unfortunately, I didn’t have these opportunities as a child, so I have been passionate about reading since becoming an adult. I spoke about my passion for murder mysteries, my interest in forensic science, and the pleasure of discovering a new author, and then reading their entire back catalogue. My latest discovery is Sharon Bolton, who I recommend to anyone interested in a book with a good and unconventional murder plot. All her books are different and gripping!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was proud to be re-elected as chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism at our AGM, and very pleased that The Vegan Society and Vegetarian for Life have agreed to continue as secretariat. My thanks to all the parliamentarians who continue to support this APPG.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering, and Cosmetology, I met the outgoing Registrar of The Hair Council, Keith Conniford, to thank him for the many years of dedicated service that he has given to the hair sector. I also met the new Registrar Gareth Penn, who I am sure will be as diligent as Keith in representing all areas of the hair sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Vegetarianism and Veganism APPG, and the Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology APPG, will be holding their first joint event in the near future with speakers representing each APPG discussing the availability and quality of hair products for vegetarians and vegans.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I must be one of the few teetotallers who attended the Long Live the Local drop-in event. My parents and grandparents managed a variety of public houses and RFCs when I was a child, so my support for locals is historical, and there are many locals in my constituency that provide traditional services, but some have expanded to be a hub providing added help for people who for example those struggling with heating and internet provisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was in the Chamber to listen to the Prime Minister delivering his statement on the Northern Ireland Protocol, in which he announced that The Windsor Framework (TWF) would deliver free-flowing trade with the whole of the UK and protect Northern Ireland’s place in our Union, and that it also safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland. The PM stated that it preserves the delicate balance of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, removing thousands of EU laws and making permanent legally binding to the protocol treaty. The majority of Conservatives supported TWF, apart from the European Reform Group (ERG) and the DUP who expressed serious reservations and stated that they would look at the details of the proposal and take time before coming to a decision.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The two Official Opposition Day debates featured: expanding the NHS Workforce and Getting Britain Back to Work. The Labour Party pushed the first debate to a vote at the conclusion of the debate, and won by 224-0 because the Tories did not take part in the vote. The second debate concluded at 7pm and the Labour Party did not push it to a vote.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As vice-chair for the APPG for Restorative Justice I attended a discussion on the recently released HMPPS Restorative Justice Policy Framework (RJPF) which has raised concerns with members of the APPG, its Advisory Board, and the wider RJ sector about the ability of services to deliver effectively on the ground. UK Government and Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) investment over the last 7 years has produced expertise and success for restorative justice, and a recent economic evaluation found there is evidence that there are cost benefits for reducing reoffending and delivering victim satisfaction of £14 for every £1 spent on restorative justice. The key recommendations from our APPG Summer 2021 Enquiry into Restorative Justice included automatics rights for victims through the Victim’s Law and making restorative justice more accessible by ending blanket bans. Elements of the RJPF will impact negatively on victims, particularly those who are victims of serious crimes, and suggests that prisons and probation services are not required to comply with the Victims Code of Practice. Any person on probation reporting as a victim must be given information about local restorative justice services, but there is no requirement for victims under HMPPS to be proactively given information, and the British Crime Survey states that only 5% of victims are aware of restorative justice. The RJPF is not clear on training for offender managers and probation practitioners who will be tasked with explaining restorative justice. There are nine limitations listed, including hate crime, extremism, domestic abuse and sexual offending, which suggests that victims of these crimes will not have access to restorative justice. The chair of our APPG, Elliot Colburn MP, will be writing to the Secretary of State for Justice seeking clarification on our concerns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to be re-elected as a vice chair of the Acquired Brain Injury APPG at its AGM. Chris Bryant MP was re-elected as chair. We had presentations from Chloe Hayward, UK Acquired Brain Injury Trust, and Davina Jones, Disability Trust, a charity which now focuses totally on brain injuries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lovely early morning start to St David’s Day when Mr Speaker held an outdoor service at Old Palace Yard. A children’s choir aged 3-11, dressed in Welsh costumes, sang Dewi Sant, and all the Parliamentarians, staff, and parents, sang the Welsh National Anthem when the Welsh Flag was raised. It reminded me of when I went to school dressed in my Welsh costume on St David’s Day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I always support Marie Curie events, and I called in to the drop-in to support its Great Daffodil Appeal 2023. Marie Curie is the leader in end-of-life experience in the UK, and provides a better life for people living with terminal illness, and their families, offering expert care in homes, and its nine hospices. Last year Marie Curie provided direct support to over 66,000 people. The Great Daffodil Appeal is in its 37th year, and people from all over the UK come together to raise funds so that Marie Curie can continue working on the front line giving expert care. This week I was proud to wear my Marie Curie daffodil and extra proud on St David’s Day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was fortunate to draw number nine in <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1630976195566374913?cxt=HHwWgsDQ3ayNsqItAAAA">Wales Questions</a>, and very fortunate that Mr Speaker called me as the last question before PMQs. Unfortunately, it was the Minister James Davies MP, and not the Secretary of State for Wales, David T C Davies MP, who answered my question, which prevented me from referring to the fact that David T C Davies was the previous chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee. However, I ploughed on and asked whether he would urge his Conservative colleagues to accept the Welsh Affairs Committee’s recommendation that HS2 is reclassified as an England-only project which would result in Wales receiving Barnett Consequentials estimated at £5 billion and would allow the Welsh Labour Government to continue to expand public transport services, and people in Wales can receive the same benefits from HS2 as those in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Minister replied that HS2 is the backbone of Britain’s rail infrastructure and it’s important for Wales to plug into and take advantage of it, but he didn’t explain how that would happen.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG for Ukraine, chaired by Alex Sobel MP, and listened to updates from charity workers on the frontline in Ukraine. Emily Tripp, Director of Airwars, which is a not-for-profit transparency watchdog which tracks, assesses, archives and investigates civilian harm claims, resulting primarily from explosive weapons used in conflict affected nations. Founded in 2014, Airwars has tracked over 66,000 locally alleged civilian deaths.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Newton, Regional Director (Europe) of the Halo Trust, which is the world’s largest de-mining charity, said that it is doubling its staff in Ukraine this year as it faces an epochal challenge to clear liberated areas of explosives. After a huge training program, it is hoping to have around 1,200 staff by this summer. It is impossible to know how many mines, rockets, and shells require to be disposed of, but it is likely to take decades. Mike said that over 125 minefields have been identified in northern Ukraine. Up to now, anti-vehicle mines have been prevalent, but personnel mines and booby traps are emerging in areas that have been recaptured by Ukrainian troops.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Spoerri, Head of Regional Delegation for UK and Ireland International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said that they have been working in Ukraine since 2014, and have massively upscaled its response since the Russian invasion. ICRC has over 700 staff working in 10 locations across Ukraine to deliver relief items to the displaced, provide medical supplies to health care facilities, restore water supply for millions of people, and other lifesaving activities. It is hard to exaggerate the toll that the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had on civilians in recent months, on top of 8 years armed conflict in Donestk and Luhansk. Civilians have been killed, injured, lost homes, loved ones, poured into neighbouring countries, or stayed and lived in underground shelters. Homes, schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. The ICRC estimates that over 17 million people need humanitarian help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine Country Director of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) told us that the survey they conducted has demonstrated the devastating impact the conflict has had on the people of Ukraine. With the bitter winter, 27% people said they had insufficient heating, 93% said they could not meet basic needs. What families need is protection, safety and warmth, access to humanitarian assistance to survive, and economic support to rebuild lives in the future. To date the IRC and its partners has reached over half a million people with critical humanitarian assistance, providing support directly to displaced families to buy food, children’s clothes, and pay bills; helping older people to teach medical facilities and heat homes; and help with acute anxiety, stress, and trauma. Marysia emphasised that we must never forget Ukraine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Ceramics APPG meeting to discuss how the recently launched Commission for Carbon Competitiveness can work with the Ceramics industry. The Commission is a cross-party and cross-industry effort to explore how the industry can achieve net zero without undermining the competitiveness of British industry. The Commission is chaired by Conservative MP John Penrose, and Stephen Kinnock MP is the Labour representative. The aims of the Commission are to examine imports where environmental standards are lower than in the UK, so have a high level of carbon, and has a cost advantage. And focus on carbon which is produced abroad and piped into the UK and the implication of introducing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in the UK.</p>

    <title>Inspiring International Women’s Day Event</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/inspiring-international-womens-day-event/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=inspiring-international-womens-day-event" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last week, I was privileged to chair a constituency event to mark International Women&amp;#8217;s Day. A packed auditorium of young girls listened attentively to the talented and inspiring women on the panel, all of whom kindly took time out of their busy lives to share their stories of success and, sometimes, struggle, competing in male-dominated professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;International Women&amp;#8217;s Day (IWD) is celebrated annually on 8 March as a global day focussing on the women&amp;#8217;s rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women. This year my team and I decided to use our platform to host a panel of inspiring local women for young girls to hear about their career journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that median hourly pay for full-time employees was 8.3% less for women than for men in April 2022. According to the World Economic Forum, it will take 268 years to close the economic gender gap – clearly, we have a long way to go, making events like these as important as ever. Young people, especially girls, can find themselves under pressure in the judgemental world of social media on top of the challenge of finding their way in the world of work, often steered towards a lower-paid career. Seeing the young folk in the room inspired by the incredible women on the panel was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Former RAF Nimrod pilot, Kirsty Harding, talked of motherhood &amp;#8211; whilst serving in an active war zone. Freda Newton, who is not only a hugely successful business woman but also a well-respected thought leader in the tourism sector, kindly shared her experiences of building successful businesses and spoke of the trial of surviving a pandemic immediately after a massive investment in her company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Clare Humphrey, founder of Will to Win, gave the perspective of a life coach, while Danielle Nicolson talked candidly about women and politics. Libby Macdonald, an advocate for fair work in social care and real living wage campaigner, spoke of her experiences in the care sector. Cecilia Grigor gave her insights on building a business in the digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I want to thank them for sharing their stories to inspire the young audience. After the event, there were many requests to take selfies and follow-up chats, which clearly showed their impact on the young audience. It was rewarding to see inspiring women, inspiring a whole generation of inspiring women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I also recently held cost-of-living surgeries across the constituency, including in Aviemore. I was grateful to the organisations who joined me at these events to help local folk struggling to make ends meet. If you need help, my team and I are always here to listen and help. You can book a meeting, a call or email me on my website at &lt;a href="http://www.drewhendrymp.scot"&gt;www.drewhendrymp.scot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before I finish, I want to give you a quick update on my It&amp;#8217;s Your Money campaign calling on energy suppliers to treat people fairly, especially to stop hoarding customers&amp;#8217; credit balances. Since raising this issue, many people have been in touch to tell me that they have discovered they are in credit, sometimes with sums over £1000. Digging further into this unfairness has exposed a litany of failures and suspect practices. Rest assured, I will continue to press for fair treatment for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;

    <title>Karin Smyth MP calls on Government to “get a grip” of rising childcare costs</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/03/08/karin-smyth-mp-calls-on-government-to-get-a-grip-of-rising-childcare-costs/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=karin-smyth-mp-calls-on-government-to-get-a-grip-of-rising-childcare-costs" type="text/html"/>

<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has called on the Government to breakdown the barriers of opportunity by ‘getting a grip’ of rising childcare costs.</p>
<p>The Government is knowingly underfunding the 15 and 30hrs childcare entitlements by over £2/hr. This is forcing providers to cross-subsidise leading to astronomical costs to parents paying for additional hours. </p>
<p>The cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two has risen by approximate £1,500 over the last five years. Moreover, unstable funding and rising costs have forced over 5,400 childcare providers to close between August 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>Polling shows that 76% of mothers who pay for childcare, say it no longer makes financial sense for them to work. In addition, 1 in 4 parents (26%) who use formal childcare, say that the cost is now more than 75% of their take home pay.</p>
<p>Figures show that an estimated 1.7 million women are prevented from taking on more hours of paid work due to childcare issues, resulting in up to £28.2bn economic output lost every year.</p>
<p>According to the IFS, government funding is not keeping-up with rising costs, meaning total funding for the free entitlement will be 8% lower in real terms in 2024–25 than it is this year.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“The Government needs to desperately get a grip of the astronomical childcare costs facing families. We now live with the fact that the cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two has risen by approximately £1,500 over the last five years meaning families are having to make horrendous decisions on how to fund childcare.</p>
<p>“We know that women end up having to provide the majority of care in society. Be it for elderly relatives or children and this holds them back from being able to take part fully in the economy. The Government’s actions have compounded this fact meaning 1.7 million women are prevented from taking on more hours of paid work.</p>
<p>“It is time for a modern childcare system that supports women from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school. Labour has a plan to do just this. We will start with breakfast clubs for every primary school child in England, enabling parents to get to work, save money and boost children’s learning and development. This will be funded by closing the non-domicile tax status.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/03/08/karin-smyth-mp-calls-on-government-to-get-a-grip-of-rising-childcare-costs/">Karin Smyth MP calls on Government to “get a grip” of rising childcare costs</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

  <title>WESTMORLAND MP ARGUES FOR TICKET OFFICES TO BE KEPT OPEN</title>

  <summary type="text">Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has today in parliament called for staffed ticket offices at railway stations to stay open.
Tim said: "A great concern for me is that we potentially stand to lose railway station ticket offices at Grange, Appleby, and at Windermere."

<p>Tim said: <em>"A great concern for me is that we potentially stand to lose railway station ticket offices at Grange, Appleby, and at Windermere."</em> Tim's concerns are that not only will rail travel become less attractive for passengers but that certain rural communities rely on this connection as mobile ticket services are not accessible for all.</p>
<p>There are fears that stations up and down the country could be closed. According to the RMT, who launched a campaign last year to keep the offices open and staffed, the move will disproportionately disadvantage disabled, vulnerable, and elderly passengers.</p>
<p>Tim raised this point during a debate on the decarbonisation of rural transport and how important 'Transport Hubs' are; one stop shops for alighting onto other forms of public transport such as bikes and buses which would be beneficial in the Lake District during the busy tourist seasons. He said: <em>"They would be great places to have such hubs, wouldn't they? And therefore, isn't that a good argument for making sure we are maintain fully staffed railway stations in rural communities."</em></p>

<div>
<div>
<p>I’ve always believed that we can judge the mark of a society by how well it treats veterans.</p>
<p>Our veterans have made sacrifices beyond measure. It goes without saying that they deserve our respect and unyielding gratitude for their service.</p>
<p>In actual fact, however, they deserve more than just respect. They deserve support, and to be able to live dignified, happy and prosperous lives.</p>
<p>Sadly, for many veterans this isn’t the case. The Government has created a postcode lottery on veteran support, with some veterans finding unnecessary barriers in important areas like employment, pensions, social care and compensation.</p>
<p>Similarly, we’ve seen no national improvement in mental health support for veterans. This is despite the fact that nearly half of all medical discharges from our armed forces are due to mental health issues, and fewer people are being seen by the MOD’s specialist mental health services than they were five years ago.</p>
<p>Nationally, we need to be doing much more to support our veterans.</p>
<p>I’ve been inspired by work I’ve seen in Tameside.</p>
<p>I’ve written before about the fact that Tameside council were one of the first local authorities to sign the military covenant – a commitment to ensure that those who are serving or have served in the Armed Forces, and their families, are treated fairly and given the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>This commitment is supported by the exceptional work of community groups like Tameside Armed Services Community.</p>
<p>I want to see this effort replicated nationally. That’s why I’ve been so proud to back Labour’s plans to boost mental health support for veterans, incorporate the armed forces covenant fully into law, and end miserable housing conditions for our veterans.</p>
<p>Crucially, the Party is also consulting as part of its ‘Veterans’ Voice’ campaign, which will give veterans and their families the opportunity to shape Labour’s plans for the next general election.</p>
<p>This work is long overdue and will be transformative for veterans and their families who have been overlooked for far too long by policymakers.</p>
<p>I want to see a government that is relentless in its drive to improve the lives of veterans. They have given so much for us, it is the least we can do for them.</p>

    <title>Put an end to postcode lottery for bone health, demands Judith</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/put-an-end-to-postcode-lottery-for-bone-health-demands-judith-cummins-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cummins MP on Tuesday called for the government to step up and provide 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services in England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a long-term health condition characterised by weak bones prone to breaking or fracture. It affects 3.5m people across the UK: a fifth of men and half of women over 50.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A report by the Royal Osteoporosis Society found that 90,000 people miss out on the treatment every year and some 2.2 million people in the UK are left with undiagnosed spinal fractures. Fracture Liaison Services&amp;nbsp;are an essential means of identifying and treating osteoporosis early. Yet, only 57% of people in England have access to this quality of life improving service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the Chamber, Judith called on the government to provide the necessary services, which could prevent over thirty thousand hip fractures by identifying bone problems early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An investment of just £27 million per year in Fracture Liaison Services would deliver over £600 million in savings over five years for the NHS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Will the Minister meet with me and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, to discuss our report, and commit to ending the postcode lottery by providing 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services for over-50s in England?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Secretary of State for Health Steve Barclay MP agreed: “Obviously, she sets out a very compelling case in terms of the return on investment. Clearly, we will need to scrutinise that in more detail.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_03_07-FLS-ROS-Health-Q.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Judith hears from the Health Secretary there is a &amp;#8216;compelling case&amp;#8217; for investing in FLS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith emphasized the need to act now to ensure that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and people are not unnecessarily left in pain with debilitating fractures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bradford has an exemplary fracture liaison service, but almost half of the country must do without. When these early opportunities to prevent fractures are missed there is a greater pressure on ambulances, acute hospital bed days, and greater stress on the NHS.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By acting now to provide full Fracture Liaison Services coverage right across England, we can save people unnecessary pain, save the NHS vital resources, and give all patients the level of care they deserve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local MP Grant Shapps opened the Generation Welwyn Hatfield Careers Fair during a constituency day last week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The event was organised by Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council and Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership to showcase the wide variety of opportunities that are available to young people who are interested in pursuing a non-traditional career path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During his opening speech, Mr Shapps talked from personal experience about how important it is for more practical career opportunities to be presented to students:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I am probably the only cabinet member without a degree, and I didn’t do A-levels either which goes to show you don’t have to take a traditional path to achieve your goals.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of students from schools across Hertfordshire had the opportunity to network with a wide variety of businesses and organisations, ranging from Barclays Bank to the Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A student shared their experience of the event: “I feel like this is an opportunity for students that you wouldn’t normally get, and it has helped me get to know work experiences and apprenticeships that will help us with our future.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps was thrilled to have been invited to open the day and thoroughly enjoyed speaking to all the businesses and students. He wishes all those who attended the best of luck and success for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Llanelli Star Column – How Pension Credit can be a welcome boost</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://niagriffith.org.uk/2023/02/llanelli-star-column-how-pension-credit-can-be-a-welcome-boost/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Many pensioners across Carmarthenshire may be losing out on vital Pension Credit help that could bring an average of £2,700 extra into their homes every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated
£5million worth of Pension Credit annually goes unclaimed in the county which
during this cost of living crisis could be used by local people to help make
ends meet.&amp;nbsp; It is a nationwide problem
too with one million households thought to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pension Credit
provides extra cash to those who are over State Pension age and on low incomes.&amp;nbsp; It is separate from the State Pension and you
might be able to qualify even if you have other income, savings or if you’re a
homeowner.&amp;nbsp; It can also act as a
“gateway” benefit which opens doors to additional help with housing costs,
council tax, TV licences and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is the most
underclaimed benefit of all and around a quarter of those eligible to claim do
not do so, missing out on support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I’m
determined to encourage as many local residents who think they might qualify to
apply.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently held
an event at the Selwyn Samuel Centre to raise awareness of Pension Credit which
attracted over 150 people, with experts from the Citizens Advice Bureau, DWP
and other organisations on hand to help.&amp;nbsp;
Anyone who thinks that they, or a loved one, may be eligible for Pension
Credit should find out more about it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claims can be
made online at &lt;a href="http://www.gov.uk/pension"&gt;www.gov.uk/pension&lt;/a&gt; credit or by phone on 0800 99 1234. &amp;nbsp;If you need help in submitting a claim then my
office is happy to assist and can put you in contact with a specialist advisor to
take you through the process.&amp;nbsp; Please get
in touch on 01554 756374 or email &lt;a href="mailto:nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk"&gt;nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my February email newsletter. It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks since the start of the year in Parliament, and I&#8217;ve been pleased to raise local and national issues in the House on issues such as pensions, road improvements and recycling/waste changes, which you can find more about below. I&#8217;ve also included some local updates on projects such as the Heanor High Streets Fund works and the long-awaited installation of step-free access at Alfreton, as well as access to health appointments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there are any issues you&#8217;d like to discuss further or that I can help with, please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch via the contact details at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>War in Ukraine – President Zelensky visit</u></strong></p>



<p>In Westminster we had the great honour of welcoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to give an address to parliament. He spoke about bravery when faced with the horrors of war, praising the courage of the men and women in Ukraine who are defending their country, and highlighting how the people of the United Kingdom embody these values themselves. It was a moving yet tongue-in-cheek speech, demonstrating that the Ukrainians share the classically British sense of humour in the face of adversity.</p>



<p>We should be incredibly proud of the support we have given to Ukraine, and the impact that we have made in helping them to defend their country. I wholeheartedly support the Government’s efforts to support Ukraine, and the equipment and training which has been provided to the Ukrainian military. It is right that the United Kingdom continues to stand up for freedom and democracy on the world stage, and to defend these values as we have done before.</p>



<p>I will be speaking to Radio Derby about the war in Ukraine as part of their coverage of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion.</p>



<p><strong><u>Pensions debates update</u></strong></p>



<p>We’ve certainly had the time to cover pensions over the last few weeks in the House of Commons. As part of my role on the Work and Pensions Committee, I’ve had the chance to speak at length in a number of debates on various aspects of pensions, and the future of our pension system.</p>



<p>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February, I chaired a Backbench Business debate on State Pension Age. We had cross-party consensus in favour of postponing a further increase to the state pension age, and discussions were had on life-expectancy in the UK. I argued the case that any further increases must consider differing effects of manual vs professional workers, and high-earners vs those who earn the least. Given the consensus against a further increase to 68, I urged the Government to factor our discussion into their upcoming review of the State Pension Age.</p>



<p>On the 6<sup>th</sup> of February, the House of Commons debated the plans to uprate pensions and benefits with inflation. I spoke strongly in favour of benefits and pensions increasing by 10% in line with inflation and argued further that there needs to be a review to work out whether the benefits and pensions given to individuals across the UK are in line with their expected living costs. Families and pensioners relying on Government support should be given enough to cover their basic needs and housing costs.</p>



<p>Finally, on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February, I attended a debate in Westminster Hall on protecting pension savers. Our discussion focused on ensuring self-employed people, gig-economy workers, full-time carers and women are all protected and supported in saving sufficiently for retirement. These groups have historically found it more difficult to save, and discussions were had on how to protect and improve their pensions. I spoke repeatedly about reforms to protect these vulnerable groups, and also on the Government new plans for an online dashboard, which will help people more easily track and plan their pension savings.</p>



<p>There are a number of changes on the way to modernise and improve the pension system, and to ensure not only that pensioners are appropriately supported in retirement, but that people are easily able to track their pensions and empowered to save sufficiently for their futures.</p>



<p>I am proud to be a part of these ongoing discussions about our pension system and the support provided to pensioners in the UK and you can find my recent contributions in the House in these debates in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-02-07b.247.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g251.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>APPG Cleaning &amp; Hygiene update</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of January I chaired a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cleaning and Hygiene. It was enlightening to speak to professionals working in cleaning services and the manufacturing of cleaning products about the industry and its importance in supporting out NHS and preventing the spread of disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was happy to be joined in this meeting by John Hines from SC Johnson Professional, who have a manufacturing plant in Denby.</p>



<p>The group was able to discuss our recent report on the role which the cleaning and hygiene industry can plan in pandemic resilience and response, as well as supporting the NHS and reducing the spread of winter flu. One of the outcomes of the report was to encourage people continue the good habits we all developed during the pandemic, which will help keep our homes and families safer and healthier.</p>



<p><strong><u>Junction 28 improvement works debate</u></strong></p>



<p>Whilst Junction 28 of the M1 isn’t directly in Amber Valley, the delays currently caused at peak times as a result of the daily congestion in this area regularly back up into our area, sometimes as far as Alfreton and Swanwick.</p>



<p>Neighbouring MP, Mark Fletcher, within whose Bolsover constituency J28 lies, is campaigning for a capacity upgrade to reduce congestions and delays, and I was pleased to support him and his campaign during a recent Westminster Hall debate in Parliament.</p>



<p>I took the opportunity to raise related issues such as noise from the A38, capacity on the roads and the importance of improvements to Junction 28 to driving growth as well as reducing the problems currently being caused.</p>



<p>You can read the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-01-11b.293.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g297.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Recycling &amp; EPR</u></strong></p>



<p>There will be a lot of changes to our waste and recycling systems coming forward over the next few years, to encourage less landfill and more recycling.</p>



<p>As a result, I recently raised a question in Parliament about the introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) for packaging, and the potential impacts of this. You can read my question and the Minister’s reply, as well as the debate in full, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2023-01-30.135354.h&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g135354.q0">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Heanor Future High Streets Fund project update</u></strong></p>



<p>Work is progressing on the Heanor Future High Streets Fund and regeneration projects. I’ve been pleased to join the programme board overseeing progress.</p>



<p>Final designs for the new Heanor marketplace have come forward and these are coming out to consultations on the 21<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> February at St Lawrence Church, as well as being recorded and available on the AVBC website shortly after. If you’d like more information on these, please contact <a href="mailto:regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk">regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, works is progressing on the plans for the regeneration of the former Heanor Grammar School into the Heanor Hub. The planning application is still live but essential works have been taking place to prevent the further deterioration of the building, with works to the roof and the removal of asbestos. I was pleased to recently visit the Grammar School to have a look around the site.</p>



<p>Finally, the remediation and regeneration of the land at Whysall Street as part of the brownfield regeneration fund is also moving forwards. Surveys have started, and a £1m grant has been secured to tidy up the site prior to turning it into 40 new affordable homes.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP &amp; dental appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have been in touch regarding access to GP and dental appointments. As one specific example, Brooklyn Medical Practice in Heanor has recently moved into the Royal Primary Care Trust.</p>



<p>I’m working to arrange update visits with them and other local GPs and dentists to discuss issues they may be facing, and feed back on issues which have been raised with me by constituents.</p>



<p>I also continue to regularly meet with our local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to discuss updates and hospital treatment updates/waiting lists with them.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to cash &amp; banking services – new deposit service announced for Ripley</u></strong></p>



<p>I know that access to cash and banking services is an issue many constituents have contacted me about, and whilst I can’t stop banks who sadly decide to close their high street branches, I have been regularly meeting with them to discuss this and maintaining access to banks for residents.</p>



<p>In addition to this, Link and Access to Cash UK are working on new ways to maintain banking services in our high streets.</p>



<p>As part of this, I’m pleased that Ripley was recently selected by Link to have a new shared deposit service in the town. This will provide consumers and businesses with convenient and accessible ways to deposit cash even if they cannot visit a bank branch.</p>



<p>I’m scheduling a meeting with Link to discuss this further, as well as access to cash in Amber Valley’s other towns, and I’ll keep you updated. Please let me know if you have any views or suggestions in the meantime though. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Step-free access for Alfreton Station update</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been in contact with Network Rail to chase updates on the long-awaited Alfreton Station access for all scheme, which is due for completion by April 2024.</p>



<p>Whilst I’m disappointed by the delays to date, I’m pleased by the progress that is now being seen, with work on the various reports and surveys now taking place. For instance, Network Rail are progressing the coal mining, topographical, ecological and drainage surveys which will then inform the final draft designs and plans.</p>



<p>I’m meeting with Network Rail over the next few weeks to get further updates and timetable information, which I’ll update you on in my next newsletter.</p>



<p><strong><u>Shared Prosperity Funding Success &#8211; £2.9 million additional funding for Amber Valley</u></strong></p>



<p>I’m pleased that confirmation has been received that the Borough Council is receiving £2.9 million in Government granting funding through the Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF). This is part of the Levelling Up agenda, and the funding will be spent across Amber Valley over the next few years.</p>



<p>In particular, projects which will receive investment include improvements to our town centres, new community sports and leisure facilities, including investment in our local parks and play areas. There will also be £240k for community and voluntary sector organisations to bid for to support specific projects and improvements.</p>



<p>Specific projects so far confirmed include a new skatepark for Heanor, shop front improvement grants and the installation of solar panels on our local leisure centres.</p>



<p><strong><u>Residents’ survey reminder</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been out and about across Amber Valley delivering a survey to as many residents as possible to ask for your views and priorities for this year ahead. If you haven’t received one yet, or if you haven’t completed it, please take just a couple of minutes to let me know your views on local and national issues online <a href="https://fs22.formsite.com/nmills002/form1/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Welcoming the announcement, MP for Boston and Skegness Matt Warman said:</p>
<p>“This £8.76 million Shared Prosperity funding to Boston and East Lindsey comes on top of the £70.3 million Town Deals and £22.8 million in Levelling Up Funding and shows the Government’s commitment to Levelling Up Boston, East Lindsey and Lincolnshire as a whole. It represents a huge vote of confidence in the vision for regeneration and growth put forward by Boston and East Lindsey Councils and the Town Deal boards.</p>
<p>“The request for expressions of interest for projects meeting the three priorities of this latest fund is a great opportunity for even more local organisations to join in driving innovation, growth and community in our area.'”</p>
<p>The full bidding guide for the funding and the expression of interest form is available on the Council’s website at <a href="http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF">http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF</a> and <a href="http://www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF">www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF</a>.</p>

    <title>Our Letter to the Prime Minister on Fulfilling Dementia Commitments</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">We Demand that the Government <span style="color:#06396a;">Fulfils its Commitments on Dementia</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Today I joined Alzheimer’s Society Ambassadors Vicky McClure and Dame Arlene Phillips as well as Elliot Colburn MP and Ananga Moonesinghe, who lives with dementia, to deliver an open letter to PM Rishi Sunak at Downing Street, demanding the Government urgently fulfil their promises on dementia.</p>
<p>Launched by leading dementia charity Alzheimer’s Society, the open letter has been signed by over 36,000 members of the public and famous names including Choreographer Dame Arlene Philips and actor Vicky McClure. We were joined at the hand-in by my colleague on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, Vice-Chair Elliot Colburn MP, showing cross-party support. It urges Rishi Sunak to deliver on previous Conservative Party commitments to dementia and not let the UK’s biggest killer fall down the political agenda.</p>
<p>Previous Conservative Prime Ministers have actively committed to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. Now Rishi Sunak must deliver on promises to reform social care, double dementia research funding and release a ten-year plan for dementia which gives the condition the priority it deserves. The 36,000 people who signed the open letter are making themselves clear – they don’t just want to hear empty promises, they want to see action. People with dementia can’t and won’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates still sitting below pre-pandemic levels, national figures reveal people are waiting up to two years in some areas for a diagnosis, thereby missing out on vital treatment and support. Alzheimer’s Society research also shows three in five people affected by dementia struggled to get social care in the past year, with half of family carers revealing they ended up in crisis, such as rushing their loved one to A&amp;E due to lack of support</p>
<p>The charity is concerned the deepening workforce crisis in social care – with vacancies sitting at 165,000 – risks leaving people with dementia desperate for help while living costs soar. Alzheimer’s Society say it’s more important now than ever for the Government to prioritise dementia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Government has made many commitments on dementia, promising to deliver a ‘visionary ten-year plan’ for dementia, to reform the social care system and double spending on dementia research by 2024.  Alzheimer’s Society says the delivery of these will be transformational for the lives of the 900,000 people living with dementia but calls on the Government to urgently make these a reality to prevent a deepening crisis in dementia care.</p>
<p>This follows the news last year that a new drug, lecanemab, was shown to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this breakthrough will mean little if diagnosis rates remain stagnant and often inaccurate. This treatment works best for people with early Alzheimer’s disease. Without early and accurate diagnosis, we risk hopeful advancements like this having minimal effect.</p>

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

    <title>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd New Warehouse in Andover</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://kitmalthouse.com/2022/berry-bros-rudd-new-warehouse-in-andover/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=berry-bros-rudd-new-warehouse-in-andover" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p></div>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
