    <title>The Coronation.</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>      The Coronation is based on ancient ceremony from a time when monarchs had executive power as head of government. Our service also reflects the complex relationship with the  Christian Church that emerged as the established Church of England from the Reformation.<br/>
      Last century coronations evolved into grand spectacles, to create a holiday mood for the public and to engage people in the change of Head of State. The great show became a celebration of our country, a projection of our country to the rest of the world, and a search for what unites us. Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition sit down together, smile on the proceedings and affirm God save the King. In return the monarch promises to serve us all and to stay above political controversy.<br/>
         I trust today’s event will proceed faultlessly and be enjoyed by all who participate, in person or at home. In a free society we are all at liberty to have our own views on both the individual monarch and the institution of monarchy. We can join in and enjoy or do something else today. For our country’s sake it is good if all goes well, foreign guests are welcomed, and diplomacy advanced in the margins of the varied programme. The new King will use his influence both to accept his role as Head of the Anglican Church and his interest in including all the faiths in the service. </p>

    <title>Election success for Labour</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/05/05/election-success-for-labour/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Labour is celebrating retaining all 50 of the seats that they have held for the last four years at the local elections on 4 May 2023. In addition to this Labour gained a seat from the Conservatives in Clifton West. There are now no Conservatives on the Council for the first time. The people of Nottingham have recognised that Labour remains the best party to lead this city moving forward and have endorsed their manifesto with an overwhelming mandate earlier today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This evening Nottingham Labour group has re-elected Cllr David Mellen as Leader of Nottingham City Council, while Cllr Audra Wynter has been elected as Deputy Leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the past four years have not always been easy, under the strong leadership of Cllr Mellen, Cllr Adele Williams and Cllr Sally Longford, Nottingham City Council has continued on its journey of improvement while maintaining the services that matter most. Cllr Williams has held the portfolio for Finance for the last year and led the delivery of a four-year balanced budget earlier this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Cllr Wynter is newly elected as deputy, she has previously served on the executive for the last year as Portfolio Holder for Highways, Transport and Parks. She was previously Chair of the Audit committee. Cllr Wynter has also led and supported social housing providers in building affordable homes and more temporary accommodations for the homeless. She has served the people of Bestwood Ward for 4 years and was re-elected earlier today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Labour has great plans for the city, and under this new mandate Nottingham Labour will seek to deliver on the five key promises made at the election as well as the pledges in the full manifesto.&lt;br&gt;Following the election victory and his own re-election Cllr Mellen said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By once again voting for the Labour Party, the people of Nottingham have told us that they want a council that can deliver on jobs and houses, cut anti-social behaviour and clean up your neighbourhoods. Nottingham Labour has a strong track record in this, and we will continue this record.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know this won’t be easy. We face ongoing financial challenges – from both the lack of investment from the Government, but also as we continue to recover from the pandemic. Our council is also currently on a journey of improvement – but I believe this will require us to be even more innovative and even more creative in the way we make changes for the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know the people who live in Nottingham have so much potential and we believe we can unlock that potential with an active, well-run City Council that supports and develops people, encourages growth and investment and provides people with security through essential public services. I am honoured to once again, have been given the responsibility of leading the council and will work with Cllr Wynter and those elected in the coming days as Portfolio Holders and all councillors elected today to repay the trust given to us by Nottingham People.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New facilities to boost the quality of life for residents
of a Cross Hands Care Home, including a bowling alley, coffee shop / bar and 26
more bedrooms were officially opened earlier today by Dame Nia Griffith, the
area’s local Member of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ambitious and innovative expansion of the Gwernllwyn
Care Home at its complex on Llandeilo Road will not only increase its capacity
to play host to more people in need of respite and residential care but, just
as importantly, provide more things to keep its existing residents and their
families occupied and supported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bowling alley and the coffee shop / bar area will
also be accessible to the general public and will allow the local community to
interact with those living in the care home in a comfortable and safe
environment.&amp;nbsp; Additional parking has also been provided on site for
visitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the new investment into the Care Home, Dame Nia
Griffith MP, said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a real pleasure to open this new state-of-the-art
extension, bar and bowling alley, as it is great that residents here in the
Gwernllwyn and their friends and family will be able to relax and enjoy a drink
and a game, without having to leave the comfort of the complex. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I can imagine it will also make visiting Mamgu or Dadgu all the more fun for younger members of the family, and I congratulate Will James and his team on planning and developing this facility.“&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil met today with Historic Scotland to discuss the reopening of Kisimul Castle in advance of the Homecoming events planned for June where many descendants families of those who left for Canada in 1923 are expected in Barra.</p>



<p>Commenting Angus Brendan MacNeil said:</p>



<p>“I am extremely disappointed and in fact angry with Historic Scotland who have made absolutely no progress on Kisimul Castle since they met with the community last summer in Castlebay Hall. They were told at this meeting about the importance of the Castle being available for the Homecoming events taking place in June 2023. A year later and no work at all has been carried out on the Castle.</p>



<p>“There has been no urgency, no care or thought from Historic Scotland about the community or the people coming to visit. For some descendants of families who left in 1923 it will be a once in a lifetime trip and with weeks to go before the Homecoming events, Historic Scotland are still passive and careless about the Castle.</p>



<p>“Having bureaucrats over to measure or look at things with no greater intention than snail’s pace progress is a slap in the face from Historic Scotland to the island and those wishing to visit the Castle.</p>



<p>“I doubt my words, or anyone else’s words will have much effect in encouraging Historic Scotland to carry out work in the next few weeks before the Homecoming. I asked if it was possible for people to at least enter the courtyard but in a metaphoric shrug of the shoulders was told that will not be allowed either.</p>



<p>“There will be a lot of disappointment felt by those visiting next month because of the lack of care and professionalism from Historic Scotland.”</p>



<p>ENDS</p>

    <title>Panasonic Leads the Way with New Heat Pump Technology Training</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, visited Panasonic Heating and Cooling HQ in Welwyn Garden City to see the company&amp;#8217;s new fully equipped training centre and the innovations they’ve made in heat pump technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Panasonic has been a key innovator in the heat pump sector being one of the first companies to introduce its heating and cooling products into Europe more than 60 years ago. The company now boasts a wide array of products which has led to it having some of the most efficient and widest ranges on the market. One of its most recent designs – the K Generation units – gained a ‘Best 100 Design Award 2022’ from the Good Design Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps was shown a variety of products during his visit and told about the new incentive scheme that the company would be bringing into place. He commented:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I was thrilled to learn about Panasonic’s new training and support scheme which launches this month. It encourages installers to train in low-carbon technologies and receive £500 upon completion of their training and their first installation of a low-carbon heat pump.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jose Alves, the UK Country Manager for Panasonic Heating and Cooling Solutions, thanked Mr Shapps for his visit:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It&amp;#8217;s always encouraging to see local politicians and government ministers taking an active interest in the issues that matter to their constituents, and the recent visit by our MP and Secretary of State is a great example of this. The fact that our MP has taken the time to learn about the training we provide, our local employment and investment initiatives, and our commitment to carbon neutrality through the use of heat pumps is a testament to his dedication to these causes”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Shapps thanks the team at Panasonic HQ for making the time to see him and for supporting Britain’s mission to decarbonise. He wishes them all the best for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weekly Round-Up :: 05 May 2023</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/05/05/weekly-round-up-05-may-2023/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-05-may-2023" type="text/html"/>

<p>On Tuesday, MPs and members of the House of Lords gathered in Westminster Hall for a reception with Their Majesties the King and the Queen Consort ahead of the Coronation. While the Royal Family stays above the party-political challenges, they both have significant interests in our areas of work. The King is particularly interested in the environment and agriculture and through his charitable organisations, community and youth events. The Queen Consort has supported the work of domestic abuse organisations and charities supporting literacy. We also had a chance to view the Speaker’s State Coach, on display in Westminster Hall, which was historically used in past Coronations and of course, the Hall itself has a long history of being used for State banquets and Coronation celebrations.<br/>
On Wednesday it was a pleasure to meet with students of the South Bristol Skills Academy who visited Parliament for a tour. It is always great to welcome young people to Parliament. I think it is easier for them to connect with the work that we MPs do when they can see where we work and can learn something about the way that Parliament functions. Please do get in contact if you are interested in tours, as community groups or schools.</p>
<p>I was able to attend the Tearfund drop-in this week for the Rubbish Campaign to find out about the impact of plastic pollution on the poorest people in the world. I encourage everyone to join with the communities, churches, and individuals and pledge to cut their use of single-use plastics for a month. Some of the statistics are truly shocking; 2 billion people have no safe way to dispose of rubbish and are forced to live and work among piles of waste, releasing toxic fumes, flooding communities, and causing up to 1 million deaths a year. 1 million people die because they are exposed to rubbish. It’s sometimes hard to imagine how we here in the UK can help people living in poverty on the other side of the world, but this is a change we can make. Single-use plastics are poisoning our earth and those living in poverty around the world are the ones paying for it. Let’s pledge our support and reduce to soon eliminate our use of single-use plastics. </p>
<p>I was pleased to speak in a Westminster Hall debate on branded medicines and the Government’s “Life Sciences Vision” that looks to invest further in research into and innovative treatments for neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases as well as obesity, ageing and mental health. It is important that we work to improve patient access to medicines and to support research into innovative medical treatments. We have some fantastic researchers coming through our universities, but we are not converting that base into the high-skill, high-wage, high-productivity economy that will lead in the field of life sciences research and will ensure that the NHS and the taxpayer are given transparency and accountability. </p>
<p>This Thursday we had the local elections across large parts of England and canvassed in Swindon and South Gloucestershire to support our Labour colleagues there. I was delighted to see such good results for Labour candidates which will only benefit their local residents. The cost-of-living crisis and the challenges facing the NHS were key issues raised on the doorstep. A Labour Government will work to help alleviate the pressures on working people that inflation and stagnating wages have brought to ensure that families are not left wondering how to feed and clothe their children and children are not put under the enormous strain of going to school hungry. We want to see an NHS that people are confident will be there for them in their most difficult times and they will not be stuck waiting for an ambulance.</p>
<p>If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/05/05/weekly-round-up-05-may-2023/">Weekly Round-Up :: 05 May 2023</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>Government science spending favours London and the South East – so our Regions miss out!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2023/05/13510/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SciTechgovuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SciTechgovuk&lt;/a&gt; Qs, I asked the SoS if the Tories were counting Horizon replacement money as new British science spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whilst the Tories cook the books on science our regional powerhouses miss out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not levelling up, it’s holding back! &lt;a href="https://t.co/H6YgzziFtE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/H6YgzziFtE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chi Onwurah ???? (@ChiOnwurah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChiOnwurah/status/1653768050154303492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;Chi Onwurah &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;(Newcastle upon Tyne Central) (Lab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I welcome the Secretary of State to her position and wish the right hon. Member for Chippenham (Michelle Donelan) well in her maternity leave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three years on, the Tories have failed in their manifesto promise to associate to Horizon Europe, and Britain has paid the price in lost jobs and scientific research. Their plan B short-changes British scientists and they are fudging the figures in other ways. Will the Secretary of State confirm that, whereas Horizon funding was counted as international science spend, she is planning to count the same money as British science spend to meet her commitment to double the British science budget? &lt;em&gt;[Interruption.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-05-03/debates/43AAE043-37CB-444F-9574-52E57E63DCF7/TopicalQuestions#contribution-DD38216F-E38F-4C3E-9522-F0CDB20D4890"&gt;https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-05-03/debates/43AAE043-37CB-444F-9574-52E57E63DCF7/TopicalQuestions#contribution-DD38216F-E38F-4C3E-9522-F0CDB20D4890&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;Chi Onwurah &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems that the Tory science superpower is actually just cooking the books. Ministers promised to increase science spend outside London and the south-east by a third while doubling it overall, so our regions continue to miss out. Now they are refusing to replace European regional development science funding, slashing £600 million from what should be our regional powerhouses. That is not levelling up—it is holding us back. The country knows it. Does the Secretary of State?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-05-03/debates/43AAE043-37CB-444F-9574-52E57E63DCF7/TopicalQuestions#contribution-A6C10AEF-D19D-4F01-8504-333EF6D98F99"&gt;https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-05-03/debates/43AAE043-37CB-444F-9574-52E57E63DCF7/TopicalQuestions#contribution-A6C10AEF-D19D-4F01-8504-333EF6D98F99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I visited Kings Heath Boys School last week which has just had a fine Ofsted report reflecting real progress achieved under four years of the current Head’s leadership.</p>



<p>It’s only by providing good schools that we can equip our children and grandchildren for the future. There’s always been a link between poor areas and school success. Labour understands this. In the 60s and 70s the Wilson government created Educational Priority Areas and after 18 years of Tory rule, the last Labour government introduced Education Action Zones to once again boost the chances of children from poorer backgrounds.</p>



<p>It’s by working with parents and carers and putting schools at the centre of communities that we build the solid foundations from which children succeed. Over 13 years of Tory rule, we’ve seen teachers abused and experts ridiculed and an attempt to return schools to teaching models experienced by too many government ministers, in private schools, over the past 50 years. It’s not structures like free schools or academisation or gimmicks about a smattering of Latin that matter. We need support for parents and programmes to attract the best teachers to disadvantaged areas.</p>



<p>Almost every successful person has a story about the teacher who influenced their direction and put them on a path to success. We need to rediscover an ambition and love for education.</p>



<p>At Kings Heath Boys they’re not planning to rest on their laurels but open up choice and opportunity by changing to an intake of boys and girls. We’re blessed with several outstanding schools in south Birmingham, they do a remarkable job despite squeezed budgets, teacher retention problems and children’s mental health issues. These are all things the government should be addressing.</p>



<p>I hope the local community will get behind plans for Kings Heath Boys which will give more children a chance to attend a school that’s best for them. I’m hungry for a Labour government that treats teachers with the respect they deserve and puts our children first.</p>



<p>It’s time to focus on a system where the talents of every child can be nurtured and where their achievements are the priority.</p>

    <title>Rural Communities Face Post Office Crisis</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p class="xmsonormal">When banks closed their doors, they reassured us that local Post Offices would fill the void. Yet, as Post Offices face similar challenges, our communities are grappling with the consequences, just as we had feared.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Communities like Newtonmore are now facing the harsh reality of losing their Post Office. If it closes, what happens to Laggan and Kingussie service provisions, given that no new industry entrants can be found? With Nethybridge Post Office not being replaced, concerns grow for the future of remaining post offices across Strathspey. How far should people be expected to travel to access vital services?</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Over the years, I have seen local postmasters at their wit’s end because of the near-impossible funding model that has been put in place – most can barely make a living wage. In the UK Parliament, there is broad cross-party support for these postmasters, and it is very clear that the current model isn’t fit for purpose. It requires Government intervention and a new Framework that works for rural postmasters and communities.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Readers, as you know, Post Office closures in rural communities have significant consequences. Local businesses struggle to access essential support, while elderly and vulnerable residents face barriers to basic amenities. Often Post Offices are social hubs; ultimately, these closures weaken the heart of our communities, undermining their resilience and vibrancy.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">As your MP, I feel a deep responsibility to ensure our communities have access to essential services. I know it can sometimes seem futile, but I believe it is essential that we do all we can to fight for these services to be protected and to look at ways we can support communities to build resilience and capacity.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">This week, I have written to both Governments, urging their support for a three-point plan to protect these vital services in rural communities:</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Firstly, it has long been clear that the UK Government needs to intervene to ensure Post Office adopt a funding model that enables postmasters to earn a living wage while ensuring the sustainability of local Post Offices. This long-overdue action has broad cross-party support in the UK Parliament.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Secondly, we need to establish legal protections around vital services such as banking, Post Offices and broadband. We need a minimum service commitment to protect smaller communities.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">We also need to continue to invest in rural infrastructure: Both Governments must allocate funds and resources to develop robust communication and transportation networks in rural areas. If the UK Government genuinely wants to level up, rural communities must be at the front of the queue for support.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">We must also explore ways Governments can support local communities to lead where the systems are letting them down. Although there are fantastic examples of community-led initiatives, we cannot leave this up to chance – we need to do all we can to find solutions that work best for the people who live and work there.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">In short, we cannot have thriving, interconnected rural communities if we have a lack of basic service provision.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">You know better than anyone what your community needs to thrive, and I would love to hear your thoughts on how we can work together to protect these vital services in our communities. Visit <a title="http://www.drewhendrymp.scot/communities" contenteditable="false" href="http://www.drewhendrymp.scot/communities">www.drewhendrymp.scot/communities</a> to share your thoughts on how we work together to build a stronger future for our rural areas.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Further to my post on 5th April 2023, I am delighted to be able to share the below Op-Ed I recently wrote for the &lt;em&gt;Dereham Times&lt;/em&gt; – outlining in further detail why I am opposing the idea of a Garden Town to the north of Dereham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5th APRIL 2023 WEBSTORY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades now, our planning system hasn’t been delivering the housing we need, in the places we need it, for the people who need it. For too long, the system appears to have been driven by the national volume house builders who too often make their money from land banking and high density commuter housing estates on the edge of existing developments – rather than through a proper planning system run to deliver for the people who need planning to work for them, instead of being done TO them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve long been concerned by the amount of development coming to areas like our own in rural Mid Norfolk – which is often inappropriate, “industrial” in scale and unsustainable. While most of our villages can take and are indeed up for (when properly asked) taking some additional new housing (without which our communities will gradually fade away), I fundamentally believe that more needs to be done to give local communities a greater say in how they develop in the years to come (with greater protections), which is why I have been so vocal in my opposition to the way so many large national developers abuse and take advantage of the planning system to dump such inappropriate and unsustainable developments on our towns and villages.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
That’s why, through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Norfolk Way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; project I set up before I became an MP, I have been so vocal in advocating for a better model of growth and development that places greater emphasis on delivering small pockets of housing of the type and aesthetic desired by local communities, and in the places they earmark. I truly believe the spirit of Localism enshrined in the 2011 Localism Act should be enhanced, with the Act itself strengthened to remove some of the loopholes we’ve seen exploited. (To read more about my views in full, please visit my ‘Planning and Protecting Our Rural Heritage and Landscape’ campaign page &lt;a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/planning-and-protecting-our-rural-landscape-and-heritage"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) I was delighted to see the NPPF reformed in the autumn by Michael Gove to give more power to local planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to make the case I have long made that the right way to plan housing is to give local councils, democratically accountable to the local residents they serve, the freedoms and incentives to plan properly for the right sort of housing and growth where it is needed ie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;around hotspots of economic growth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;on brownfield sites in areas needing regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;around growth towns with the infrastructure and services available to sustain further growth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;in villages with a Neighbourhood Plan setting out the amount of housing they are happy/able to take and which ensures affordable &amp; appropriate local housing for local workers and residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what the &lt;strong&gt;Breckland&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;South Norfolk Council&lt;/strong&gt; Local Plans rightly aim to do. What we don’t need in rural Norfolk is massive commuter estate “New Towns” dumped in the middle of rural mud Norfolk without proper infrastructure, facilities, sustainable transport links or fit with the existing pattern of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Elmham New Town&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Elmham New Town would also represent massive development of the precious River Wensum chalk stream habitats (not to mention a Site of Specific Scientific Interest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I was delighted to chair a meeting on Friday in North Elmham with local parish councils and local councillors Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge to make clear that the idea of a new town in the area will NOT be supported by ourselves as elected local  representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill and Gordon confirmed that Breckland Council are NOT zoning this area for major housebuilding, and will oppose a re-application of the New Town as we did successfully last time it was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--image paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
              
      &lt;div class="image-container"&gt;
        
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-image field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;  &lt;img src="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/sites/georgefreeman.co.uk/files/2023-04/george_freeman_north_elmham_4.jpg" width="1000" height="523" loading="lazy" typeof="foaf:Image" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
        &lt;div class="caption"&gt;
          &lt;div class="svg"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Towns and Garden Villages &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst there are places in the UK where there may be a strong case for a new generation of garden towns and villages, with all of the necessary infrastructure and transport links (either to drive regeneration as in parts of the post-industrial North, or to alleviate the pressure around major growth hits spots like Cambridge), North Elmham is not a sustainable location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of several possible sites in East Anglia that could perhaps take such a garden town or village: specifically the dilapidated station sites on the Cambridge-Ely-Brandon-Thetford-Attleborough-Wymondham-Norwich railway line – as part of the Oxford-Cambridge East-West Railway Development Company I have championed over the years, and especially during my time as Minister for the Future of Transport at the DfT.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
However, I’ve also been very clear that, for any such development, we need to be sure that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any such developments must avoid the loss of ancient woodland and high quality farmland&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We see a serious commitment to Net Zero and building into the plans a higher quality, cleaner, greener standard of life – not continuing to same old, lazy model of house dumping that sees thousands of additional vehicles tearing through old country lanes and causing more congestion and rat-running&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is serious investment into public and private infrastructure – with proper road, rail, cycle and walking routes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any such development is planned appropriately and sustainably, and that it makes sense in the wider community context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I have not seen any evidence to suggest that a garden town or village would be appropriate in this part of Mid Norfolk, and given the rural and inaccessible nature of North Elmham and the surrounding villages, the already serious congestion on the nearby road network and the nationally significant environmental and habitat importance of the Wensum Valley, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which this idea could be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, it would make far more sense for such a significant level of growth to be focussed down closer to the A11 Corridor – which Breckland Council themselves have, rightly, recognised is the key growth artery in our region and have tried to focus the bulk of the district’s future growth. I know the Leader of Breckland Council, Cllr Sam Chapman-Allen, and both Cllr Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge strongly support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--image paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
              
      &lt;div class="image-container"&gt;
        
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-image field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;  &lt;img src="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/sites/georgefreeman.co.uk/files/2023-04/george_freeman_north_elmham_1.jpg" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy" typeof="foaf:Image" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
        &lt;div class="caption"&gt;
          &lt;div class="svg"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I was delighted to join the c12 local parish councils representing the areas that would be affected by this idea to make clear my opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the meeting we agreed some important Next Steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To reconvene a meeting of ALL the parish councils in the affected area after the forthcoming local elections on May 4th to make sure all write to Breckland Council formally to express their concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bill and Gordon and I will liaise to ensure all the local residents who object have their objections properly acknowledged by BDC.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will invite my neighbouring MP, Jerome Mayhew, to join that follow-up meeting given a number of his Broadland communities are in close proximity to the site around North Elmham and would also be affected.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will write to Michael Gove (Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) and the Minister for Housing to make clear why any New Towns and Garden Villages should only be  delivered in the right locations with the associated connectivity, infrastructure and services required) and not in inappropriate locations with the obvious environmental, sustainability and transport issues this scale of development would inevitably threaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please be assured that I will keep on this in the weeks and months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>South Shropshire MP Philip Dunne has added his voice to Melanoma Awareness Month after experts raised concerns in response to new data released today by charity Melanoma Focus. This shows that 32% of British people reported rarely or never using sunscreen when in the UK and only 11% say they always use it. </p>

<p>The majority 39% of those who do not use sunscreen said it’s because they don't expect to burn. This is despite 52% of all respondents reporting that they got sunburned at least once per year.</p>

<p>Melanoma skin cancer is a serious and potentially fatal condition, yet people in the UK are often ignoring the dangers posed by prolonged exposure to UV rays. </p>

<p>1 in 36 men and 1 in 47 women in the UK will be diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer in their lifetime. It is the deadliest form of skin cancer and is in the top five most diagnosed cancers in the UK, killing 2,333 people per year.  Yet 86% of melanomas are preventable.</p>

<p>The reported use of sunbeds is also a serious concern. It is estimated that in the UK about 100 people die each year from melanomas due to sunbed use.</p>

<p><strong>Philip Dunne</strong> <strong>said</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I support Melanoma Awareness Month and am pleased to raise awareness for my constituents to protect themselves and their loved ones from this increasingly prevalent and very serious form of skin cancer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Susanna Daniels, CEO of Melanoma Focus, said:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“About seven people die from melanoma every day in the UK and more people die from melanoma in the UK than in Australia. The fact that people are continuing to ignore the warnings and not take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from skin cancer is concerning. </p>

<p>“About 9 in 10 melanoma skin cancer cases are preventable and it is vital that people take the warnings about the dangers of excessive sun exposure and the dangers of sunbed use seriously”.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">If you look up the word ‘community’ in the dictionary, you get a fairly long (and fairly uninspiring) list of things that may constitute a community. Near the bottom of the dictionary entry, however, one example always stands out to me: ‘‘joint ownership or liability’’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">I think this is an interesting aspect of community that is often forgotten about. Community isn’t just about living in the same place. It’s about recognising that we share the spaces and resources around us and have a responsibility to look out for one another. Our actions affect others, and when we work together to improve our local area, we all benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">Community is something that <span class="markdfaie4zkl" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span> excels at. I’ve lived in <span class="markdfaie4zkl" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span> my whole life and have served various parts of it as an elected representative since 1996. In that time, I’ve seen community spirit grow and grow, and reach new heights over the last few years as the pandemic altered our lives in unprecedented ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">I’ve been inspired by how the local community have responded to the cost of living crisis we currently face. Food banks like St Mary’s Haughton Green and <span class="markdfaie4zkl" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span> East in Dukinfield continue to do exceptional work, and charities like The Bread and Butter Thing are growing from strength to strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">We’ve also seen the advent of various park ‘Friends’ groups and community centres like the Together Centre in Dukinfield and Ryecroft Hall Community Association. In Dane Bank, the local community stepped up and came together earlier this year to keep the Denton West Community Centre open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">None of these local initiatives can function without people. Volunteers often do vital work with little to no recognition, so it’s important to occasionally stop and thank those who donate their time to community groups, as well as things like Scouts, Guides, sports clubs and much more. These individuals are the beating heart of the local area, and without them <span class="markdfaie4zkl" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span> wouldn’t be the vibrant, caring and proactive community it is today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">So, as we approach the summer, and the various community initiatives that will come alongside it, take a moment to appreciate the volunteers’ making things tick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif;">Even better, if you find yourself with some free time, get involved with something local. It’s a great way to meet friends, neighbours, and connect with the community here in <span class="markdfaie4zkl" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span>.</span></p>

The debate, which is entitled 'Environmental Land Management Scheme Funding For Upland Areas', will take place in Westminster Hall from 11am.
It comes as the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed to Tim this week that just 25 farms in the entire Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency have signed up to the new Sustainable Farming Incentive.</summary>

<p>It comes as the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed to Tim this week that just 25 farms in the entire Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency have signed up to the new Sustainable Farming Incentive.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"There's never been a more uncertain time for British farming so this is a really good opportunity to put the concerns of farmers directly to ministers.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Government has proposed to offer upland farmers in the Lakes and Dales a payment which is a third less than other farms. Many of those farms are now facing the prospect of either going out of business or else having to intensify their farming in order to make ends meet - and damaging the environment in the process.</em></p>
<p><em>"As a result, our beautiful, historic Cumbrian landscapes could change dramatically for the worse in a very quick time..</em></p>
<p><em>"If you have any points that you would like me to put across in the debate then please do let me know."</em></p>

    <title>MARTIN CALLS ON UK GOV TO COMMIT TO BETTER WORKER PROTECTIONS</title>

<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has vowed to fight for better safety in workplaces as West Dunbartonshire marks International Workers’ Memorial Day.</p>



<p>Speaking in parliament, SNP MP Martin challenged UK government Minister Penny Mordaunt over concerns about the number of deaths linked to asbestos exposure in the workplace.</p>



<p>According to the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE), the UK has the highest rates of workplace asbestos-related deaths per capita in the world. In West Dunbartonshire, the number of people dying from mesothelioma and asbestos-related cancers is amongst the highest in the country – linked to the area’s heavy industrial past.</p>



<p>During a Westminster debate on Asbestos in the Workplace, local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes also highlighted the work of Clydebank Asbestos Group in speaking up for families affected by asbestos.</p>



<p>A select committee of MPs has recommended a target be set to remove all asbestos from public and commercial buildings within a 40-year timeframe. However, the UK government rejected these recommendations, arguing asbestos is safe if it remains undisturbed.</p>

<p>A number of MPs and trade unions say that government inaction is putting lives at risk, citing the increasing number of deaths linked to asbestos exposure in schools and hospital buildings.</p>



<p>International Workers’ Memorial Day is an annual day of remembrance on 28<sup>th</sup> April for workers killed, disabled, injured or made unwell by their work.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“As we mark International Workers’ Memorial Day, I’m determined to continue pressing for greater protections and safety in the workplace.</p>



<p>“Across the UK, too many workers lose their lives to occupational illness or fatal injury. Asbestos alone kills 5,000 people every year – and is the biggest cause of work-related deaths in this country.</p>



<p>“There is a painful legacy of asbestos in West Dunbartonshire from our shipbuilding past. However, the British government is misguided to dismiss the risk posed by asbestos in present-day public buildings and workplaces.</p>



<p>“I’ll continue working with Clydebank Asbestos Group, trade unions, and others in parliament to defend the rights of workers and raise awareness of the dangers of asbestos.”</p>



<p><strong><em>The</em> <em>Hansard transcript of Martin’s parliamentary question to Penny Mordaunt, Leader of the House of Commons, is available <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-04-27/debates/864713BD-8052-4C6D-B3F5-39D7CA6D59D7/details#contribution-812F4BDF-0851-4AFA-9840-13078BE57954">here.</a></em></strong></p>

<p>I was delighted to be invited to speak at the ADASS Spring Seminar this week.</p>
<p>When I think about everything councils have faced – the repeated Government cuts to council budgets, the horrors of Covid19, the endless restructuring of the NHS and u-turns on social care reform &#8211; I sometimes wonder how they keep going.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>But then I look at my own city, and Leicester’s Director of Adult Social Services Martin Samuels and his team, and I see that it’s the passion for improving the lives of older and disabled people, the commitment to making our communities better places to live, and the leadership on social care that has helped keep the show on the road.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;  &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; A constituent of mine discovered in November that HMRC had handed over £972 to the company MortgageSmiths, who took almost half of that in commission fees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he hadn&amp;#8217;t commissioned this company in the first place, he demanded to see the application form, which was such a poor forgery that both his and his wife&amp;#8217;s signature were clearly in the same handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the government repeatedly warning the public not to fall for financial scams, it&amp;#8217;s incredible that the HMRC fell for this one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So can we have a Treasury statement, so we can understand the extent of this problem, what&amp;#8217;s being done to prevent it in the future, and when constituents like mine will actually get their money from the HMRC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government response&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Well, I thank the Honourable Lady for raising this case. I&amp;#8217;m very sorry to hear that. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She may of course wish to raise it at Treasury questions on the 9th of May.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But given this is a sizable chunk of money for them to be out of pocket with, I will certainly raise this today with HMRC and ask them to contact the Honourable Lady with regard to this case.&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>The cross party Work and Pensions Select Committee responsible for scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) policies, has published a damning report on the Government’s health assessments system which is used to screen whether sick and disabled people should have access to vital social security payments.</p>
<p>These payments provide financial support to a working age person who is unable to work because of their health condition or disability; the assessment for this is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and is for either Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work. In addition there is also the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment process to access support to cover the extra costs disabled people face because of their disability which are estimated at over £580 a month on average; this is for the Personal Independence Payment.</p>
<p>The report exposed the detrimental impact of the assessment process itself on the health and well being of claimants.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the Committee, Professor Ben Barr, from the University of Liverpool, was asked about research he carried out in 2015 which looked at the impacts of the WCA as claimants were reassessed to move onto Employment Support Allowance. His analysis estimated that across England, the WCA had caused an additional 600 suicides, 300,000 additional cases of mental health problems and a large rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over a nine-year period.</p>
<p>“We looked at whether it could be explained by other factors or other economic trends, but there was quite a unique pattern in the increase in mental health problems, and the most likely explanation was that it was due to the reassessment process”, he told the committee. He said it is difficult to assess improvements since this study as “there are no systems in place” to monitor the impact of the health assessments and the potential adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>A survey by the University of Kent last year found half of claimants who have been through the WCA process said it made their mental health worse. Dr Ben Baumberg Geiger, who led the research, told the committee: “It is not sufficient to say that this is a historical problem and that everything is fine now. If there was more transparency, it would be easier to know a bit more about it, but the evidence suggests that there are still major problems with the WCA that could lead to an increased risk of poor mental health.”</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth and a Member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee said:</p>
<p><em>“The evidence is clear – the current system is not fit for purpose. The DWP’s own figures show that <strong><u>274 people a month</u></strong> <strong><u>die 6 months after being found fit for work </u></strong>and <strong><u>60 people a month die 3 months after having PIP refused. </u></strong>These are poorly people not the shirkers and scroungers that some Conservatives refer to when discussing social security claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“We heard evidence during the inquiry that when people were being reassessed between 2010 and 2013, there were 600 additional suicides. In 2020, National Audit Office has said that the claimant deaths that the DWP had investigated were the tip of the iceberg. The current approach is contributing, directly and indirectly, to the physical and mental health harm of claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“Last year the Equality Watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, issued a Section 23 order against the Department of Work and Pensions over their discriminatory treatment of disabled claimants.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Government itself has effectively acknowledged a different approach is needed when they announced that they would abolition the Work Capability Assessments, something I have been calling for years, but the detail of the future process is too opaque and doesn’t provide reassurance. Given it will take place several years to replace, what happens until then?</em></p>
<p><em>“I remain deeply concerned about these health assessments but also about the punitive nature of the sanctions regime, introduced in 2012 and, once again, on the rise. </em></p>
<p><em>“I believe it is these social security policies, as well as the inadequacy of the social security support especially for working age people, and the dehumanising culture that claimants too often experience that collectively contribute to the adverse health effects is the It is so detrimental to vulnerable people especially, but to all people as well.</em></p>
<p><em>“Given the failure of the Government to make many of the changes recommended in our predecessor Committee in 2018, I hold little hope in them taking on board the improvements set out in the report.”</em></p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update on a few local matters.</p>
<p>First of all, for those of you intending to vote in the local elections in May, a reminder if you did not know, that you will need to take photo ID with you to the polling station. This is part of a new approach to avoid people impersonating someone else by voting in their name.</p>
<p>There are details on Council websites for Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead and what to do if you do not have a suitable form of ID.</p>

<h2>Stoneleigh Railway Crossing</h2>
<p>For those of you living in the Stoneleigh area, work is due to start soon on the new step free crossing over the railway at the station. I hope this will make things much easier for people with mobility issues, not to mention small children in buggies or heavy shopping bags.</p>
<p>This is a timetable for the planned work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6424" src="http://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-1024x664.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="664" srcset="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-200x130.jpg 200w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-600x389.jpg 600w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-800x519.jpg 800w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable-1024x664.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisgrayling.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Timetable.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></p>
<h2>One Day Travel Cards</h2>
<p>Transport for London has just announced that it is planning to scrap paper one day travelcards from outside London, which is likely to affect many people in our area. I will be lodging an objection to this, particularly as it is happening at the same time as the proposed ULEZ. If you want to find out more, they have published details at</p>
<p><a class="x1fey0fg xmper1u x1edh9d7" href="https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/travelcards">https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/travelcards</a></p>
<p>Although the feedback form on this site is pretty limited, I would encourage you to share any opinions about the proposal via the link.</p>
<h2>Veterans Group</h2>
<p>In the last bulletin I gave you details of the support for veterans in Epsom and Ewell. I have been asked to remind those living in Mole Valley about the veterans hub for those living in the district, which is also providing valuable support locally. You can find out all the details at</p>

<p>The world’s first certified and transparent deepfake video has been created in a new bid to counter disinformation on the internet.</p>



<p>The video, of the AI expert Nina Schick warning about the dangers of the technology, contains the first industry watermark declaring it is a deepfake.</p>



<p>Deepfake videos are generated by artificial intelligence and can create lifelike representations of people, sometimes without their consent.</p>



<p>The technology is advancing at pace, with one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fake-surrender-video-intensifies-online-ukraine-war-vp2mhvq7s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Zelensky purporting to surrender</a>&nbsp;to Russia going viral in 2022. A pro-Chinese news channel featuring a pair of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/deepfake-newsreaders-pump-out-pro-china-news-gfthxjl0j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computer-generated presenters</a>&nbsp;was discovered this year in the first case of a state-aligned operation using deepfakes.</p>



<p>Concern over the spread of the AI has increased as new tools have emerged to make deepfakes&nbsp;easier, with consumers able to create videos using just text commands.</p>



<p>Deepfake pictures are also becoming more sophisticated with viral shots of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/donald-trump-deepfakes-ai-twitter-g50n7vnbm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump’s arrest</a>&nbsp;and the Pope in a puffer jacket circulating widely last week. However, there is greater concern over the impact of fake videos as the public is more inclined to believe them.</p>



<p>In the certified video, a lifelike representation of Schick made with her consent and using her voice asks: “What if we can no longer rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/falling-faker-makers-online-videos-kim-kardashian-p5bjzlwsd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">authenticity</a>&nbsp;of what we see and hear? We are at the dawn of artificial intelligence and already the lines of what is real and fiction are becoming blurred.”</p>



<p>The video has a cryptographic signature added to it that states it has been created with AI, who made it and when. This is connected to the video for its lifetime and any edits are made transparent. The viewer can see it in the top right of the screen under an “i” symbol.</p>



<p>The video was created by Truepic, a digital authenticity company, and Revel.ai, an AI studio used by Hollywood and the advertising industry.</p>



<p>Schick is hoping the video will “jolt” the tech and media industries into adopting the signature more widely.</p>



<p>“If you can’t trust digital media or any digital content then I think that’s an existential threat, not only to politicians or politics, but to business to society to everyone, because everyone has to exist in this ecosystem, we don’t really have a choice about it anymore,” she said.</p>



<p>“So part of this campaign is to show, to jolt, to force all the companies that are creating the models and creating AI-generated content, to start signing their content, to put transparency at the heart of generative AI. [It’s] also to start pushing platforms to adopt the open standard to ensure that we can see the authenticity of all content.”</p>



<p>Europe is looking to bring in tighter laws to regulate the technology and its draft AI Act stipulates that synthetic media should be labelled. The UK is looking at a more light-touch regulation.</p>



<p><strong>John Penrose, the Conservative MP who is campaigning for the Online Safety Bill to tackle disinformation, welcomed the push for AI watermarking.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“The Russians have already deepfaked a video of Zelensky urging Ukrainian troops to surrender, and the potential for disinformation undermining our elections and destroying trust in everything from the NHS to news reports and our justice system will only get worse,” he said.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Telling real pictures and videos from ever-improving fakes is essential, which is why being able to check where any image comes from, whether it has been altered and by who is vital. Otherwise we’ll never know if someone is trying to spin us a yarn or not.”</strong></p>



<p>Henry Ajder, an expert in generative AI, said widespread watermarking was the right strategy, adding: “Detection [of malicious deepfakes] is not going to be a viable approach at scale, whereas I feel that these approaches are viable at scale, or at least certainly much more. They have some challenges around implementation.</p>



<p>“But I think this is the best approach that’s available to us right now for verifying all content and providing a new standard, a new benchmark for how we understand trust in media.”</p>



<p>The AI watermarking technology has been developed to a new standard created by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), an industry body aiming to address the issue of digital transparency. Its steering members include the BBC, Adobe, Intel, Sony, Microsoft and Truepic.</p>



<p id="x_last-paragraph">Last week Adobe, which owns Photoshop, released Firefly, an AI image generator that tags its output with the C2PA information. Adobe is an investor in Truepic, to which Schick is an adviser.</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-89/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/guarantee-our-essentials">Guarantee Our Essentials</a> event to listen to Ian from the Joseph Resolution Foundation (JRF), Jess from Trussell Trust (TT), and Sir Stephen Timms MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee discussing the proposal that the UK Government should introduce an Essentials Guarantee (EG), which would embed in our social security system the widely supported principle that at a minimum Universal Credit (UC) should protect people from going without essentials.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The JRF and TT research shows that 90% of households on UC are going without essentials, UC is now at its lowest level as a proportion of average earnings, 66% of the public believe UC is too low, almost 50% of households have their UC reduced by benefits deductions and caps. Inadequate social security is the main driver of food bank need. The TT gave out 1.3 million parcels between April and September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Essentials Guarantee, developed in line with public attitude insights, and focus groups, would ensure that this policy would enshrine in legislation:</p>
<ul>
<li>An independent process to regularly determine the EG level based on the cost of essentials, such as food, utilities, and vital household goods, for the adults in a household excluding rent and council tax.</li>
<li>That UC’s standard allowance must at least meet this level.</li>
<li>That deductions, such as debt repayments to UK Government, or as a result of the benefit cap, can never pull support below this level.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The JRF and TT analysis indicates it should be at least £120 for a single adult, and £200 for a couple.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of implementing the Essentials Guarantee would be an additional £22 billion a year in 2023-24, assuming full roll out of UC. The devastating effect of people going without essentials has a profound effect on our society, and our economy, and there will be savings to public services as a result of improved outcomes, not costed in this figure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Timms said that social security benefits are reviewed every year, but are not updated, and in real terms the current level is the lowest in 40 years. He said that his committee’s inquiry into the level of benefits will be reporting in the near future, and that low benefits are a problem for the economy because people take the first job offered, irrespective of matching their skills, so economic productivity is a problem. Stephen said that during the pandemic the UK Government provided money for a £20 week UC enhancement, and that should have continued. The UC uplift also prevented sanctions. Stephen said that benefits levels are not linked to anything logical, it’s an arbitrary figure, which is actually set at the deep poverty level, not the poverty level. And the gaps for under 25s are bigger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The event was very well attended, and there was agreement among speakers and attendees to support the EG proposals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-13/debates/97D4F67E-2C1B-44CB-B860-DD9024958EEF/IllegalMigrationBill">Illegal Migration Bill</a>. The Labour Party Reasoned Amendment to Second Reading of the Illegal Migration Bill was pushed to a vote at 10pm and was lost by 249-312 votes. The opposition parties voted against the Second Reading of the Bill and lost by 250-312 votes, against the Programme Motion and lost by 248-312 votes, and against the Money Motion and lost by 246-310 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Child Maintenance Services APPG, chaired by Jamie Stone MP, was held online and the guest speaker was Sir Stephen Timms MP who spoke about his Work and Pensions Committee enquiry into Children in Poverty, which will be published after Easter. He spoke about the themes of the enquiry which were formulated after taking evidence from witnesses at the committee. Gingerbread stated that for CMS, there are 1.9 million families caring for 1.9 million children, and single parent families are experiencing twice the rate of poverty as couples. If CM was paid in full it would lift 60% out of poverty.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parents receiving CM:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcement had improved but the National Audit Office (NAO) found it could be better. Half the payments are not made, so arrears are continually growing. There is scope for fraud in self-employed paying parents, and no enforcement for receiving parents. Domestic abusers exert control, especially in direct payments, so there is a need for legislation to stop this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcement is also very slow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parents paying CM:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rates of payment have not been updated since 1998.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The affordability of payments disincentivises paying parents to get work because they will have to increase payments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After paying, some are left with little money to live on.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There have been suicides among paying parents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Generally:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CM calculations are not accurate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Historic debts and CSA are included in payment calculations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is no explanation about how CM is assessed or calculated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CMS does not encourage settlement between parties, because there are winners and losers, but no compromise.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to the publication of the Work and Pensions Select Committee’s report.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called into the Cat Theft event hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Cats, and met representatives from Pet Theft Awareness which is an organisation dedicated to highlighting the growing threat of pet abduction within the public and Parliament. The Cat Theft Report 2022 consists of FOI requests about cat theft sent to all UK police forces from 2015-2021. Very little data previously existed before this report collated it from the forces that responded. The report found that during 2020-21, cat theft soared by 40% to an all time high of 560. But only 2 cases resulted in prosecution in 2021, which equates to 0.035%. The UK Government has decided to exclude cats from the pet abduction offence in the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, so cats will still be treated as inanimate objects under the Theft Act 1968, and their sentience is not recognised.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I joined the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Earth Hour UK event. On 25th March every year, millions of people around the world take time out of their busy lives to reflect on what nature means to them. Earth Hour is one of the largest movements for the planet, and gives us a chance to take a moment in solidarity, coming together to look after each other and our one shared home. We need to reset, recharge, and re-evaluate how we can continue standing up for our world every day. This year WWF UK are focusing closer to home on the amazing nature across the UK featured in the BBC series Wild Isles with Sir David Attenborough. The series focuses on the beautiful nature in the UK, and the need to protect the biodiversity, because unfortunately the UK is in the bottom 10% of global countries, where biodiversity is concerned.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-14/debates/12BE7356-3FDA-4474-8D0A-C0F3EC649E36/HS2RevisedTimetableAndBudget">Urgent Question (UQ) on HS2</a> was very well attended, and I stood hoping to be called by the Speaker. I was the penultimate person to be called, and I asked the Minister whether he accepted the Welsh Affairs Committee cross-party recommendation that HS2 is reclassified as an England-only project and Wales will then receive £5 billion Barnett Consequentials which will allow the Welsh Labour Government to continue to expand public transport services so that people in Wales will receive the same benefits from HS2 as those in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland? The Minister did not give a direct answer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG Western Gateway (WG) meeting was held so that members could have a confidential preview of WG’s 2050 vision to transform rail for South Wales and Western England, which will be launched at an event in Bristol on 23rd March 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the AGM of the APPG Western Rail Link, and was re-elected a vice-chair. Tan Dhesi MP for Slough was re-elected chair. The APPG has been campaigning for many years for a rail link to join Reading to Heathrow Airport, removing the necessity for passengers flying from Heathrow to take the train from West of the UK to Paddington in order to get the Heathrow Express from Paddington to Heathrow, or for passengers to get off the trains from the West of England or Wales at Reading, and get a bus from Reading to Heathrow. Unfortunately, this service doesn’t often link up as planned, and causes huge waiting times between rail and bus journeys. The proposed rail link will be 6.5km between GWR main line and Heathrow, taking 26 minutes, and will create 42,000 new jobs, with £1.5 billion savings to business. 20% of the UK would have access to Heathrow via one rail interchange, saving 30 million road miles per year, reducing congestion on M4, M3, and M25. It was announced by UK Government in 2012 as a nationally significant infrastructure project. It has widespread stakeholder and business support, and it has been fully costed, but is awaiting final planning approval and funding. Public consultation took place in 2018. A platform has already been built at Terminal 5 at Heathrow. The project stalled during Covid, but now is the time to resurrect the campaign so that passengers from the West who want to travel the world can enjoy direct travel to Heathrow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The AGM of the APPG on Autism was well attended, and I was re-elected a vice-chair. The Rt Hon Sir Robert Buckland MP was elected chair. Autism is a lifelong disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world. There are over 7000,000 autistic adults and children in the UK. Without support and understanding they will miss out on education, struggle to find work, and become isolated. The <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/">National Autistic Society</a> (NAS) transforms lives, changes attitudes to create a society that embraces autistic people. The Moonshot Vision is central to everything the NAS wants to achieve, and is the answer to the question “what does a society that works for autistic people look like?”. It consists of two parts: future realities and milestones along the way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the newly constituted APPG for Trade Justice, whose aim is to explore how trade has a real life impact, including how trade interacts with food standards, farming and animal welfare, environment and climate change, jobs and workers’ rights, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law, digital rights and online harm, public services, health and the NHS. I was elected a vice-chair. Members of the APPG received a briefing about the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), and its need of revision to face the challenges of the 21st century. The ECT was designed in the 1990s, with 50 signatories, but the ISDS in the treaty has been used by fossil fuel companies to sue governments for billions when governments try and curb dangerous global heating projects. The EU has been leading reform, but some member states have withdrawn completely from the ECT, and the European Commission advocates a full bloc withdrawal. The UK needs to withdraw from the ECT, or risk the UK Government being sued when it rejects applications for fossil fuel projects by multinational companies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called into the Payment Choice Alliance (PCA) drop in and learned about the campaign by the Payment Choice Alliance to empower voters to make their own payment decisions. Businesses are going cashless, and ATMs are declining. The PCA’s mission is that everyone should have the right to choose cash or card, banks should provide a free cash deposit and withdrawal machine, and better technology should be available that gives everyone opportunities to use their cash when they choose.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I bobbed during the newly created Department for Science, Innovation and Technology Oral Questions, and raised the superb R&amp;D facility being built as part of the Global Centre of Rail Excellence being developed in Onllwyn in Neath. <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-15/debates/AE6EEFA7-B392-46EA-B1A3-24B09376C82D/ResearchAndDevelopmentSector">I spoke about the GCRE</a> becoming the UK’s first net zero rail testing facility, rail innovation, testing and verification for mainline passenger and freight railways, developing next generation for the rail sector, and asked the new Minister Michelle Donelan MP if she would reconfirm her Government’s commitment to deliver £10 million for research and development at the GCRE. The new Minister stated that she was happy to meet me to discuss in detail the point I was raising. I have emailed Ms Donelan and formally requested a meeting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-15/debates/A0E6D8A4-816A-4130-A8BA-FF332B53C354/LocalHousingAllowance">Westminster Hall debate about Local Housing Allowance</a> (LHA) secured by the Honourable Member for Arfon, Hywel Williams MP. I stated that Wales is facing a housing crisis because there is a shortage of affordable properties that people can purchase or rent. The shortage forces many low-income families to move into a property they cannot afford, risking financial hardship, or into a property in poor condition, or seek assistance from homelessness services. Research by the Bevan Foundation found 51 properties advertised for rent in Neath in February 2023, but not one was covered by the LHA rate, which the UK Government has frozen since 2020 at 2018-19 private rental rates. The UK Government is responsible for determining the rate, and it must ensure that it covers the cost of renting a property. The chancellor could have used his Spring Budget to increase the rate, but he didn’t. He has not provided housing security, increased mental and physical illness amongst people struggling to pay their rent, or put food on the table, and put added pressure on local authorities trying to deliver frontline services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The House was sitting on Friday for Private Members’ Bills (PMB) and I was in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-17/debates/2810283D-E238-4512-95AB-42500F839550/HuntingTrophies(ImportProhibition)Bill">Chamber to support the Report Stage and Third Reading</a> of the PMB to Ban Trophy Hunting. I have been an officer of the APPG to Ban Trophy Hunting, chaired by Sir Roger Gale MP, for many years, and have been part of the campaign to ban the import of trophies taken by animal hunters into the UK. The founders of the campaign were my dear friends, Eduardo Goncalves, author of many books about the disgusting cruelty of trophy hunting, and the late Sir David Amess MP, who championed animal welfare throughout his time in Parliament. Despite the Bill having cross party and UK Government support, a few Conservative backbenchers had tabled 26 wrecking amendments in a tactic to prevent the Bill passing its stages in the Commons. The amendments were in the names of Sir Christopher Chope MP and Sir Bill Wiggins MP. If all or any of the amendments had been pushed to a vote, the Bill would have run out of time. The amendments’ proposers spoke about the false statistics produced by the campaign and highlighted in Eduardo’s books, and that trophy hunting was beneficial because the vast sums of money that Trophy hunters pay to kill defenceless wild animals helps to conserve lands in Africa. The Government Whip Rebecca Harries MP negotiated a compromise with the rebels that the UK Government would accept two of the amendments which would allow the Bill to pass without a vote. I <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-17/debates/2810283D-E238-4512-95AB-42500F839550/HuntingTrophies(ImportProhibition)Bill">intervened</a> on the Bill’s sponsor Henry Smith MP to state my constituency’s support for the Bill and commend Eduardo for founding the campaign and revealing the sordid world of killing sentient animals for entertainment. I also intervened on Sir David’s successor Anna Firth MP who was making a very emotional speech about Sir David to say how kind Sir David was to me since I became an MP in 2015, and how he encouraged me to become involved in animal welfare campaigns. The Minister Trudy Harrison MP pledged UK Government support, and that Bill passed through its Report and Third Reading stages, and has progressed to the Lords where it will proceed through similar stages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Rt Hon Chris Skidmore MP secured a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-21/debates/97E78295-CC1E-492F-ABD8-B570D781D2A2/EnergyCharterTreaty">thirty-minute debate</a> in Westminster Hall debate on the Energy Charter Treaty ECT. For thirty-minute debates, there are no other speakers apart from the proposer and the UK Government Minister, but members can make short interventions with prior permission from the proposer. I contacted Chris in advance, and he kindly gave me permission to make an intervention. Chris made the case for the UK to withdraw from the ECT as soon as possible. I made the point that if the UK cancels oil and gas projects it could face legal claims under the ISDS mechanism of the ECT of up to £9.4 billion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Skidmore MP was re-elected chair of the Environment APPG at its AGM, and I was re-elected one of the vice-chairs. The Green Alliance was confirmed as the secretariat for another 12 months.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the World Down’s Syndrome Day event hosted by Rt Hon Liam Fox MP who has been campaigning on behalf of Down’s Syndrome families for many years. It is nearly a year since the ground-breaking <a href="https://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/our-work/campaigning/the-down-syndrome-act/">Down Syndrome Act</a> became law, and people from all over the UK have contributed to the UK Government’s call for evidence from which the guidance will be drafted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the Fair Game event for South Wales MPs, sponsored by Jess Morden MP Newport East to listen to guest speakers: Niall Cooper, CEO of Fair Game; Mike Baker, Director of Advocacy, Fair Game, and it was hoped that John Scales former Liverpool player would attend, but unfortunately, he couldn’t make it. Fair game are a grassroots organisation who have engaged with football clubs across the UK and in South Wales. Their aim is to indentify problems, consult experts, to provide long term solutions. They believe that clubs are the hub of communities and should be helped to be sustainable, and offer men’s, women’s, children’s, and walking football. However, well run clubs are never rewarded. The speakers told us about the need to reform financial and governance structures in football to make the game work for supporters at all levels following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-securing-the-games-future">White Paper on Football Governance</a> and the <a href="https://thefsa.org.uk/our-work/fan-led-review/">Fan Led Review</a>. The speakers told us that the White Paper is supposed to improve the game, but there is pressure to weaken the proposals. That the equality standards and environmental proposals were in the review but are not in the White Paper. That there should be financial distribution from the top clubs down across the bottom pyramid clubs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meg Hillier MP hosted an event in Parliament to <a href="https://www.nrpfnetwork.org.uk/nrpf-connect/nrpf-connect-data">launch a report</a> published by IPPR, Praxis, and Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, GMIAU on the impact of the long, costly, 10-year route to settlement, of which most people are subject to No Recourse to Public Funds. The report interviewed 300 people on this route, and found that: more than 50% struggle with affording bills and food; over 20% faced housing problems, and sofa surfed, or were rough sleeping; 41% borrow from family or friends to pay the costs of the application; 75% wouldn’t be able to pay the cost of permanent residency even if they fulfill all the demoing criteria, because they can’t afford the fee; and 28% stated that the 10-year route made it harder for them to keep their job. For people who do not meet the 5-year criteria, they have to pursue the 10-year route, but have to reapply to the Home Office every 2 and a half years, which costs £13,000 for an adult, and £11,000 for a child under 16. The applications are complex and there is very limited access to legal aid. If an applicant loses their immigration status, due to making a mistake in the application (38%) or not affording the fee (37%), they have to start the 10-year process again. The majority of people are women, mothers, carers, and from black and ethnic minorities. The process for applicants causes 66% to have mental health problems, There is a need for an urgent review of this process in the context of a wider immigration review because people have to save any money they have to pay the fees, and have no money, food, clothes. The costly fees are paid to the Home Office for “administrative charges”, but the majority of applicants’ status do not change during the two and half year interval between applications, so it is a “tick box” exercise. The real costs are estimated to be a third of the fees. The 10 year route is killing people and the UK Government must find a better, more humane method for people who have lived in the UK for over 10 years (60 %) or 20 years (20%), to be granted settled status.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-trade/about-our-services">Department for Business and Trade DBT</a> held an Expert Showcase event in Parliament. Andrew Mitchell, Director General of UK Exports and Trade, spoke about the Export Academy, Export Finance, Export Credit Agency, and introduced speakers. The Welsh representative was the very famous Welsh Expert Exporter Stephen Davies, CEO of Penderyn Whisky, who spoke about the growing export success of Penderyn and their increasing range of products that are seen all over the world. Stephen said that they started the company 20 years ago, and now have 100 employees in North and South Wales, and are opening a new factory in Swansea in the near future. His challenge is to find partners across the world to grow the exporting branch of the business. The UK Government Trade Minister Kevin Hollinrake MP spoke about his Government’s policy to race to a trillion exports by 2030s, with an export strategy and a 12-year plan. Richard Graham MP spoke about being one of the UK Government’s Trade Envoys. I learned about the support available to exporters and potential exporters for Neath businesses from the Welsh Government representative Tony Hicks and Mia Rees DBT, and I shall be meeting the two regional Trade Advisers, Jan Morgan and Trygve Rees, that cover the Neath area in the near future to find out the range of support available to businesses in Neath.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected as a vice-chair at the AGM of the APPG for Multiple Sclerosis, and Charlotte Nichols MP was elected as the new chair. There are nearly 140,000 people with MS in the UK and 5,680 people in Wales. It will be the 70th Anniversary of the MS Society this year, and the APPG plans to spotlight some of the challenges that face people with MS today, and the opportunity offered by cutting edge research. The APPG will discuss findings from <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/our-work/our-evidence/my-ms-my-needs">My MS My Needs</a> 4 treatments and services for progressive MS. There will be a round table event on mental health support with the MS Society and other MS charities in May. And there should be reform to the welfare system reducing barriers to accessing support and benefits for MS sufferers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the APPG for Drugs Alcohol &amp; Justice (DAJ) meeting we held a minute silence for our vice-chair Baroness Marsham who had recently passed away. Then we took part in a roundtable discussion on drug &amp; alcohol treatment and recovery in prison, chaired by my dear friend Dan Carden MP, and coordinated by my friend Richard Hanford.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The speakers were:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Trace, CEO, Forward Trust (formally Addictive Diseases Trust ADT) which was launched in 1991 with its first intensive drug rehab programme in HMP Downview funded from charities and donations. The prison service commissioned an independent study of their Substance Abuse Treatment Programme in 1994, and the graduates reported unanimously that the treatment had altered their lives and stopped them reoffending and also improved their personal relationships. In 1995 Lord Justice Woolf commended the programme in Parliament, which helped to secure future funding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Scott, Criminal Justice Manager, Humankind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">John, a prisoner who turned his life around following 30 years of repeat offending to obtain money for drugs, but the ADT programme he completed in Downview (which he calls Brownview!) prison in 1991 stopped him reoffending.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen, a prisoner who stopped 20 years of reoffending to get money for drogs every time  he was released through completing a Restorative Justice (RJ) programme.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mike spoke about universal truths, that there is a high proportion of drug and alcohol offending, and early intervention is crucial. There’s a cohort of 200,000 repeat offenders. The Morgan Report 2011-12 is still the only national review that has been produced. For 40 years there was a scattergun approach, but in the 1999 UK Government budget, funding was provided for treatment programmes to stop drugs and alcohol addiction in every prison. There were 120 prisons and there were 100 programmes operating by 2010, but unfortunately these ceased in 2012. The MOJ transferred the programmes from the MOJ to the NHS budget, and all the learning of the previous decade was lost. The wing drug dealers have increased in the last decade, and the MOJ is not creating an environment where prisoners choose to have treatment. Services are massively stretched. The Carol Black Report includes recommendations that are excellent, but the report has been stalled since it’s been with the current UK Government Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab MP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Scott, prison support service manager at Humankind Charity, which was registered in 1984, whose aim is to focus on vocational preparation programmes for young and unemployed in County Durham, and has worked with youth and adult offenders since the late 1980s. In 2019 it merged with Blenheim CDP Charity and EDP joined them in 2020. Humankind has 1400 staff and 100 volunteers providing services to over 85000 people, including substance misuse, clinical services, employment training, education, housing, and health and wellbeing. Jessica spoke about the 7 North East Prisons she oversees. Humankind offers psychosocial support. Detox and alopharma given at the start of a sentence. The drug espranol is used as a blocker, and buvidal is given by injection which is prescribed for a week or a month and which allows ex-prisoners to work normal hours when they get a job on release, without having to go to a pharmacy every day to get methadone. Naloxone, an opiate reversal, is given out when prisoners are released, and is now available as a nasal spray, which helps them to avoid using needles. Peer mentors are brought into prison, because it’s more effective for former prisoners who have recovered to encourage prisoners who are trying to recover. In June they will open a reconnect hub outside HMP Durham to help former prisoners not succcombing to the drugs and alcohol culture on release. This service will be available all hours to former prisoners whenever needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen spoke about reoffending over 30 years and what turned his life around was RJ. But if prisoners choose RJ there is retribution from the prison wing gangs who pick on the vulnerable and don’t like their drugs trade decreasing because prisoners want to be cured. He saw so much self-harm and suicide in prison that he had to change. It was RJ that succeeded where other programmes failed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">John is a graduate of the ADT (now Forward Trust) programme and now delivers the programme. He was on the first ADT programme in 1991 in Downview, and delivering the programme keeps him sane, and is therapy for him. He told us about the Minnesota 12-step programme.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice chair of the APPG for RJ I was very encouraged to listen to Stephen’s positive experience of RJ, and I was delighted that Dan Carden MP said he would like his APPG to work with us to promote RJ.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I also signed EDM 950, about women’s drug and alcohol treatment created by Rachael Maskell MP, who is another good friend and a member of the APPG DAJ.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice chair of the APPG Music I attended the superb event “Whose Song is it Anyway – Women in Music” Launch with Dr Hayleigh Bosher, Brunel University, London, hosted by the chair of the APPG and my dear friend Kevin Brennan MP, who is himself a very talented singer songwriter and a founder member of the group MP4, which is made up of 4 cross-party MPs. The event was made up of speeches, round tables, and artists who performed live.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair for the APPG Music, I always enjoy our meetings. This We had an update from UK Music, about BBC cuts, the increasing cost of US visas, copyright consequences for AI, and plans to consult with Parties ahead of their manifestos for the next General Election. We had a presentation from BPI, the record label’s voice in the UK for Universal, Warner, and Sony. The UK is the third largest recorded music market in the world. The BPI set up the Brit School in Croydon, and East London Arts and Music in Bow. The UK Government started the free school funding process in June 2022, and the BPI has bid to set up a Northern Brit School in Bradford for 16-19 year olds for an immersive creative environment in cross disciplines including music, tech, performance, dance, production, film, digital design but also maths and English GCSEs. There is support from Tracy Brabin MP, the Leader of Bradford Council, CEO of Bradford MDC, and Bradford will be the City of Culture in 2025.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Entain and SportAid drop-in event to meet some of the athletes sponsored by these partnership organisations. SportsAid is a national charity founded to help Great Britain’s brightest sporting prospects who aspire to be the next Olympic, Paralympic, Commonwealth and World Champions, by providing grants to help with training and competition costs, and mentoring by professional athletes. Entain is one of the largest sports betting and gaming groups, which supports grassroots and professional sport across the UK through its Entain Foundation. SportsAid and Entain have been partners since 2019, and have provided 200 British budding stars with financial awards. The partnership has been extended to 2024, and will support an additional 100 athletes in their sporting careers. I met up with my friend Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of Sport Wales, who is a former national, commonwealth and paralympic athlete, and an amazing advocate for all sport.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The main <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-27/debates/5D4369C7-D5F5-42D5-B8DF-462BC5DDA601/IllegalMigrationBill">business in the chamber</a> was the first day of the Illegal Migration Bill, with six-hour protected time for the debate. There were many amendments and new clauses spoken to in the debate, and some were pushed to a vote by the proposers. The votes started at 10pm, and the opposition voted for amendment 76, and lost 244-308; abstained on SNP New Clause 6, which was lost 67-307; supported New Clause 24, which was lost by 248-301; and voted for New Clause 25, which was lost by 196-306.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The GWR event was supported by Network Rail Wales, Western Gateway, Transport for Wales, Crosscountry Trains, and was hosted by Rt Hon Theresa May MP. Many parliamentarians turned up to hear about the future plans for rail in Wales and the borders by the organisations. GWR unveiled its <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/service_disruptions/48.aspx">new timetable</a> starting next month with extra mainline services on most routes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Parliamentary drop-in on reform of the Dangerous Dogs Act, hosted by my old school friend Wayne David MP. Emma Whitfield, the mother of 10-year-old Jack Lis who was tragically killed by a dangerous dog in November 2021, was at the event and bravely spoke about the effect that Jack’s death had had on her and her family. There were also a number of experts at the event who spoke about how the Act does not work, and the need for reform – Dr Sam Gaines, Head of Companion Animals, RSPCA; Claire Calder, Chair of the Dogs Control Coalition, and Head of Public Affairs, Dogs Trust; Dr Marc Abraham OBE, chair of the All-Party Dog Advisory Welfare Group; and Vanessa Walden, co founder of Hope Rescue Centre, Llanharan. Over the last 12 months, 12 people across the UK have died after being attacked by a dangerous dog. I <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-06/debates/E7DC68B3-E1E5-449B-B922-F3333187C8FB/Breed-SpecificLegislation">opened the debate on Breed Specific Legislation</a> which specified proposals to reform the Act, with input from the expert speakers who attended the event, on behalf of the Petitions Committee on 6th June 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG for Restorative Justice met to receive a presentation from the Youth Justice Board UK, and to discuss progress on updates from the APPG Advisory Group, from its chair Jim Simon, and review the evidence gathered for the work streams on health and social care, and education, emanating from our Inquiry Report published in September 2022.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Robbie and Gwen from Uplift UK who will be the new secretariat for the relaunch of the Climate Change APPG, which will be chaired by Caroline Lucas MP. Barry Gardiner MP and I have agreed to become vice-chairs. Uplift UK’s mission is to support and energise the movement for a just and fossil fuel-free UK. At the meeting we discussed plans for raising the importance of climate change, and how the UK Government needs to take a more progressive stance to reach its climate change targets. The Welsh Labour Government was the first government to set up a climate change department, led by Minister Julie James MS for Swansea West, and Deputy Minister Lee Waters MS for Llanelli. I suggested that the APPG should visit the Global Centre of Rail Excellence, which is being developed in Neath, which will be the first net zero test facility for rail in the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-28/debates/6F481923-B613-4807-BD4B-B1ED72AC3A75/IllegalMigrationBill">second day of the Illegal Migration Bill</a>, and many more amendments and clauses were debated for six hours. The votes started just before 8pm. The opposition supported amendment 189 to exempt Afghan Nationals from the provisions in the Bill, but this was defeated by 242 to 309 votes. We voted against New Clause 11, and lost 242 to 302 votes; supported amendment 288, and lost by 248 to 299 votes; supported New Clause 21 and lost by 249-301; snd supported New Clause 27, but lost this by 248-301.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to be re-elected a vice-chair at the AGM of the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) APPG. Andrew Lewer MP was re-elected as the chair. We listened to a presentation from the MND Research Institute about funding streams and research trials for new medicines being developed to arrest the progression of MND.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the Parkinson’s APPG I attended the Parkinson’s World Day event with the former chair and my very dear friend Baroness Anita Gale. The theme for World Parkinson’s Day which was on 11th April is “finding the bright and the brilliant”. There are currently 145,000 people living with Parkinson’s in the UK, which will increase to 172,000 by 2030. The most common symptoms are freezing, tremor, painful muscle cramps, difficulty speaking, anxiety and depression. Parkinson’s is the fastest growing neurodegenerative condition in the world, but the health and social care workforce is already under resourced and overstretched. In Wales there are currently just over 25 whole time equivalent Parkinson’s nurses. Areas for improvement across the UK include: specialised multidisciplinary working; standardised practice; communication and information sharing; medicines management and educating the workforce. Heath and Social Care is devolved to Wales and Parkinson’s UK Cymru are raising issues with the Senedd and Welsh Government, led by Rachel Williams, Policy Campaigns and Communications Manager Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-29/debates/5C3EDB22-A3C3-4FE7-8A2B-98B52833D063/SpringBudgetWales">Westminster Hall Debate about the Spring Budget in Wales</a> which was a 90 minute debate secured by my friend Ruth Jones MP for Newport West. I raised issues about the cost of living crisis that the people of Wales are suffering after 13 years of Tory policies, and the urgent need for the UK Government to reform Local Housing Allowance and Universal Credit. Local Housing Allowance (LHA) was introduced in 2008, and is the amount of housing benefit or the housing element of Universal Credit (UC), available to people who are renting from private landlords, which is based on the area in which the person lives, and the number of bedrooms they require. LHA rates have been frozen since 2020 at 2018-19 rates, and research by the Bevan Foundation found that in my Neath Constituency there were 51 properties advertised to rent in February 2023, but not one property was fully covered by the LHA rate. People are faced with the choice of putting food on the table, or paying their rent, risking homelessness. The Chancellor could have used his Spring Budget to increase the LHA rates, but he didn’t. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation recently launched its research on an Essentials Guarantee which would reform Universal Credit to ensure people can afford the essentials, food and non-alcoholic drink, electricity and gas, water, clothes and shoes, communications, sundries such as cleaning materials, during hard times. This was calculated to be £120 a week for a single person over 25, which is £35 more than UC, and £200 for a couple over 35, which is £66 more than UC, from April 2023. The Trussel Trust support these proposals and its data show that inadequate Social Security is the main driver of food bank need, having given out 1.3 million food parcels between April and September 2022. Universal Credit urgently needs reforming because it is not preventing widespread poverty, but yet again the Chancellor didn’t address the inadequacy of UC in his Spring Budget. He could have at least reinstated the £20 per week uplift that was implemented during the Covid pandemic. I finished my speech by urging the UK Government to reclassify HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail as England only projects so that Wales will receive Barnett Consequentials, and I asked the Minister when his UK Government will pay the outstanding £10 million for the R&amp;D department of the GCRE. Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any commitments for reform of LHA, nor UC, and no answer to the GCRE monies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-29/debates/EE76DD85-892D-424D-87B1-50B933FEDF36/Finance(No2)Bill">Second Reading of the Finance Bill (no2),</a> which started at 2pm and was voted on at just after 6pm. The Official Opposition had tabled a Reasoned Amendment which was pushed to a vote and was defeated by 211-289 votes. And the Second Reading of the Bill was not opposed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I became very emotional at the Marie Curie led Day of National Reflection which aims to bring together communities, and organisations across the UK to remember family, friends, colleagues who have died, support those who are grieving, and give communities a space to talk openly about death and dying. Whether sudden or expected, the death of someone we care about can be completely devastating and recent times have reminded us that no one should have to go through it alone. Marie Curie was a steering group member of the independent UK Commission on Bereavement established to explore challenges and solutions to better support bereaved people across all four nations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Commission made 4 recommendations:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Governments in all four nations must commit: 6p per person to develop resources and evaluate cross sector collaborative initiatives which must reflect needs of communities across the UK and prioritise underserved population groups; 79p annually per person to transform bereavement services over the next 5 years, particularly focusing on racialised, ethnic and other marginalised communities; conduct a review of the information flow from death registration to relevant public bodies; and the UK Government should establish and deliver a cross departmental strategy for bereavement that recognises support following bereavement as a human right. I spoke about the sudden death of my brother James just before Christmas, which has left me devastated.</p>

    <title>Matt Warman MP welcomes school debaters to Downing Street</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2023/03/29/matt-warman-mp-welcomes-school-debaters-to-downing-street/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-4189 aligncenter" srcset="https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized-300x225.png 300w, https://mattwarman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Downing-Street-resized.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the visit &lt;strong&gt;Matt Warman MP commented&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith&lt;/strong&gt; who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Budget Special Newsletter:</h1>



<p>Earlier this week I was in the House of Commons to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Spring Budget. You can watch my speech in response&nbsp;<a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/9a2782e4-5f86-4a9d-8dcd-b6767b517c25?in=17:31:37">here</a>. Following the financial turmoil last Autumn this wasn’t expected to be a dramatic budget, but the improving position of the economy enabled the Chancellor to make some significant announcements.</p>



<p>The good economic news was that we are no longer forecast to enter recession this year and inflation is forecast to be below 3% by Christmas, a significant reduction on the current position of over 10% and a sign that the tough measures taken to stabilise the economy are working.</p>



<p>I welcome the focus of the Spring Budget on the everyday costs of average working families and support for services and businesses which are central to our communities. I am also pleased that much of this support will be going towards families and individuals here in Amber Valley, saving them money on their bills, fuel prices, childcare and allowing them to benefit from broader economic investment and growth.</p>



<p>The main announcements were:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Extending Energy Bills Support:</h2>



<p>The Energy Price Guarantee, which has capped energy bills for households across the UK at an average of £2,500 a year will be extended for 3 months to the end of June 2023 saving the average household £160. Bills are forecast to fall below this level from July. In my speech following the Budget I urged the Chancellor to extend this to next March in the event prices don’t fall as expected so we all have certainty over what we will pay next winter.</p>



<p>Additionally, houses on prepayments meters are set to see an even greater benefit, as the Government is ending Prepayment Meter premium, ensuring that the prices these customers pay are in line with those on direct debit schemes. Forced prepayment meter installations are also suspended, ensuring those struggling to pay are not being taken advantage of by energy companies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056786.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fuel Duty frozen:</h2>



<p>The freeze on Fuel Duty is also set to be extended for 2023, cancelling the planned 11p rise. The Government will also be maintaining the 5p cut on fuel duty for a further 12 months. While prices have fallen back from the peak, they are still high and freezing the duty will save motorists up to £200 this year. I know this will be welcomed by all those of you who have recently written to me in favour of keeping fuel duty frozen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056811.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making childcare more affordable:</h2>



<p>I know only too well how large a burden the cost of childcare for under 3s is, in many cases making working impossible. Parents also have challenges in Amber Valley finding places.</p>



<p>The Spring Budget includes a number of reforms to reduce childcare costs for working families, allowing parents to return to work should they wish. Free childcare is being extended to young families with children between 9 months and 3 years (from when 30 hours free is currently provided). Families where all adults work over 16 hours a week will be entitled to up to 30 hours of free childcare – this is being phased in from next Spring to ensure sufficient spaces are available.</p>



<p>For those on Universal Credit who wish to return to work, we are increasing the maximum claim limits up to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children and allowing parents to be paid upfront rather than having to pay the cost themselves first.</p>



<p>In order to boost the number of childminders and increase the provision of childcare services, the Government is introducing an incentive of £600 for new child-minders and up to £1200 for those who join the profession through an agency. An additional £204 million is also being provided to fund nurseries which are offering free childcare hours.</p>



<p>And finally, we are increasing funding so primary schools can provide wrap around childcare between 8am and 6pm.</p>



<p>I welcome this support being given to young working families and am pleased that these policies have been introduced following recommendations by myself and my colleagues on the Work and Pensions Select Committee in a recent report.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056839.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting our pubs:</h2>



<p>Pubs in Amber Valley will also benefit from the Budget, helping these establishments continue to play an important role in our town centres and our communities. While the new Alcohol Duty rates will be introduced for alcoholic drinks in supermarkets in August, pubs will be able to keep their prices down due to Draught Relief being raised from 5% to 9.2%.</p>



<p>This means that the price of an average draught pint of beer served in a pub will not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than in supermarkets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056856.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fixing potholes in Derbyshire:</h2>



<p>Many residents of Amber Valley will also be pleased to hear that there will be an expansion of the funding being assigned to fix potholes. The Government is allocating an additional £200 million to fix potholes, which is the equivalent of 4 million potholes being fixed across the UK. Derbyshire’s share of this is £4.2m.</p>



<p>If you know of any potholes that need fixing, please send me an email via my Street Watch reporting below and we’ll report them to the Council.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056873.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting leisure centres &amp; keeping pools warm:</h2>



<p>We are lucky enough to have 3 leisure centres here in Amber Valley, and I welcome the support being given to help them keep their heating costs down and continue to provide fun healthy activities and spaces for everyone in Amber Valley. The Government has announced it is allocated £63 million to a support fund for leisure centres to access, in order to help them keep our pools warm and pay their energy bills.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1679056891.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Universal Support Scheme:</h2>



<p>I am pleased that reforms are being introduced to separate benefits entitlement from ability to work for those on disability support. Too long this has stopped those on disability benefits from working, for fear of losing financial support. The Government wants to help those who wish to work but are held back by their disability. To do this they are providing Universal Support up to £4000 per person to help these individuals find jobs and make the necessary adjustments to allow them to enter the workforce.</p>

    <title>Put an end to postcode lottery for bone health, demands Judith</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/put-an-end-to-postcode-lottery-for-bone-health-demands-judith-cummins-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cummins MP on Tuesday called for the government to step up and provide 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services in England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a long-term health condition characterised by weak bones prone to breaking or fracture. It affects 3.5m people across the UK: a fifth of men and half of women over 50.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A report by the Royal Osteoporosis Society found that 90,000 people miss out on the treatment every year and some 2.2 million people in the UK are left with undiagnosed spinal fractures. Fracture Liaison Services&amp;nbsp;are an essential means of identifying and treating osteoporosis early. Yet, only 57% of people in England have access to this quality of life improving service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the Chamber, Judith called on the government to provide the necessary services, which could prevent over thirty thousand hip fractures by identifying bone problems early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An investment of just £27 million per year in Fracture Liaison Services would deliver over £600 million in savings over five years for the NHS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Will the Minister meet with me and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, to discuss our report, and commit to ending the postcode lottery by providing 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services for over-50s in England?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Secretary of State for Health Steve Barclay MP agreed: “Obviously, she sets out a very compelling case in terms of the return on investment. Clearly, we will need to scrutinise that in more detail.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_03_07-FLS-ROS-Health-Q.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Judith hears from the Health Secretary there is a &amp;#8216;compelling case&amp;#8217; for investing in FLS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith emphasized the need to act now to ensure that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and people are not unnecessarily left in pain with debilitating fractures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bradford has an exemplary fracture liaison service, but almost half of the country must do without. When these early opportunities to prevent fractures are missed there is a greater pressure on ambulances, acute hospital bed days, and greater stress on the NHS.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By acting now to provide full Fracture Liaison Services coverage right across England, we can save people unnecessary pain, save the NHS vital resources, and give all patients the level of care they deserve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was deeply concerned to read the decision taken by the Court in this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63313556">case</a>.</p>
<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p></div>

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a historic debt of honour to them.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
