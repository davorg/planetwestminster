    <title>Celebrating Women’s History Month in Parliament</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/celebrating-womens-history-month-in-parliament/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This March, the House of Commons and House of Lords will be celebrating Women’s History Month.</p>
<p>There are many influential women throughout history who have impacted UK laws and equal rights and it is right to champion their achievements during this Women’s History Month.<br/>
It takes each and every one of us to make the UK a fair place to live where we all have access to opportunities to move forward together.</p>
<p>As the first female Member of Parliament elected to represent Aldridge-Brownhills I have been both fortunate and privileged to serve as a Minister within Government and take on the role to serve as the first ever Conservative Chief Whip.</p>
<p>As the Houses of Parliament look back through history and celebrate Women’s History Month I firmly believe it is important to acknowledge that everybody should have equal opportunities to effect change and that we should celebrate the benefits that a truly wide and diverse range of voices can achieve. Throughout the centuries many strong women have stepped up to fight inequality and break down barriers for future generation and during the month of March we honour these women.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more there are many resources available through the Parliamentary Education Service. More information and activities can be found here:<br/>

  <title>SOUTH LAKES MP SLAMS DENIAL OF BATHING WATER STATUS BY DEFRA</title>

  <summary type="text">Today, South Lakes MP Tim Farron has slammed the decision by the Secretary of State for the Environment (DEFRA), Thérèse Coffey, to deny 'bathing water status' to Coniston Water and the River Kent at Staveley.
The decision follows a tireless campaign by activists in both locations for the status, given the number of tourists and residents that bathe in the areas. In a reply to the applications from DEFRA they justified the decision by saying both the applications 'did not meet the criteria'. However, in neither the reply or the initial application process the Department has not laid out what the criteria are.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today, South Lakes MP Tim Farron has slammed the decision by the Secretary of State for the Environment (DEFRA), Thérèse Coffey, to deny 'bathing water status' to Coniston Water and the River Kent at Staveley.</p>
<p>The decision follows a tireless campaign by activists in both locations for the status, given the number of tourists and residents that bathe in the areas. In a reply to the applications from DEFRA they justified the decision by saying both the applications 'did not meet the criteria'. However, in neither the reply or the initial application process the Department has not laid out what the criteria are.</p>
<p>As a result, Tim has today written to the DEFRA Secretary to demand answers on what the criteria actually are and how many applications have been successful within the last 12 months. It follows the rejection of 'bathing water status' applications across the country, including applications from Therese Coffey's own constituency in Suffolk.</p>
<p>In his letter Tim writes: <em>"The only reason I and others can see this decision as being justified is that you are under the impression that not enough people bathe in these waters for the status to be necessary, which is simply not the case.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Lake District is the second most popular tourist destination within the UK. We see almost 16 million visitors every year. The majority of those visitors come to bear witness to the natural beauty we are lucky enough to live next to, which a lot of them do by swimming.</em></p>
<p><em>"May I also take this moment to make the point that if there has been a reduction in the number of swimmers at either Coniston Water or the River Kent at Staveley in recent times it may be due to the decisions of your Government to allow water companies to dump raw sewage in our lakes and rivers."</em></p>
<p>Tim ended his letter by emphasising the importance of the statuses for protecting the environment: <em>"Please see these applications for what they are, opportunities to protect our environment - which should be a source of national pride - and guarantee places of natural beauty for our children."</em></p>

I am afraid that my right hon. Friend raises a very worrying fact about what we are seeing.

    <title>Nottingham Labour proposes date for Castle reopening</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2023/03/14/nottingham-labour-proposes-date-for-castle-reopening/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Labour is proposing to re-open the Castle for the people of Nottingham in June 2023, subject to approval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A report to be considered by the council’s Executive Board on Tuesday 21 March recommends spending up to £2.1m over the next three years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The council’s Museum and Galleries service has experience of managing nationally-renowned heritage sites such as Wollaton Hall and Newstead Abbey. Since the insolvency of the Castle Trust in November last year, the service has been working hard to come up with a plan to reopen the Castle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cllr-Kotsonis-Official-Photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cllr-Kotsonis-Official-Photo-683x1024.jpg" alt="Bearded an in Glasses, Cllr Kotsonis" class="wp-image-2956" width="-497" height="-745" srcset="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cllr-Kotsonis-Official-Photo-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cllr-Kotsonis-Official-Photo-200x300.jpg 200w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cllr-Kotsonis-Official-Photo-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cllr-Kotsonis-Official-Photo.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cllr Kotsonis, portfolio holder for Leisure, Culture and Planning&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Portfolio holder for Leisure, Culture and Planning Councillor Pavlos Kotsonis said: “We have had an incredible amount of investment and refurbishments carried out on the Castle, so the proposal is to review the pricing strategy and governance arrangements to make sure the Castle is inclusive and accessible to all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are proud that at a time of difficulty we have been able to mobilise quickly and that we will be able to reopen such an integral part of what it means to be Nottingham in time for the summer season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In Nottingham we are ambitious to be a child-friendly city and we believe that accessing the Castle and learning about the history of the site and of Nottingham in general is especially important for families and young people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the Castle is reopened we will ensure that the exhibitions will be representative of all our diverse communities across the city and that they will celebrate Nottingham and its people, to whom the Castle truly belongs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposal for Executive Board also includes early engagement events in the Castle grounds in May. Further details about a proposed programme of activities and pricing structure will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MARTIN PRAISES WEST DUNBARTONSHIRE KINSHIP CARERS AS NEW CENTRE OPENS</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has praised the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/kinshipcarewd?lang=en-GB">West Dunbartonshire Kinship Carers</a> as the group officially opened the doors of their new community support centre in Clydebank.</p>



<p>West Dunbartonshire’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes tabled an Early Day Motion (EDM) in the House of Commons commending the group on 12 years of supporting kinship carers in his constituency.</p>



<p>During a visit to the newly opened centre at Clydebank’s Erskine House, MP Martin met with families and presented a copy of the EDM to Micheleine Kane, Chair of WD Kinship Carers.</p>



<p>The new space will be used to provide support for children’s mental health and anxiety coaching, while also offering kinship carers a place to be listened to and supported in a welcoming environment.</p>



<p>The centre’s opening coincided with the start of Scottish Kinship Care Week, which celebrates the role of extended family or friends who care for children when they cannot remain with their birth parents.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“I was delighted to visit West Dunbartonshire Kinship Care’s new facility to mark Kinship Care Week, and commend the group on their important work supporting kinship carers in my constituency.</p>



<p>“It was a privilege to meet with some of the amazing families WD Kinship Care have helped over the past 12 years. In providing secure and loving homes for young people, kinship care families play a hugely valuable role in our communities which is often unacknowledged.</p>



<p>“The new local support centre will undoubtedly make a significant difference to children’s mental health and the wellbeing of kinship carers, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have across West Dunbartonshire.”</p>

    <title>Dunne welcomes Ajax programme progress</title>

    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-date field--type-datetime field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;13 March 2023&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dunne welcomes Ajax programme progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Dunne asks Defence Secretary Ben Wallace for an update on Ajax procurement, where supply chain is being geared up to produce full vehicle set. The Ministry of Defence Secretary of State said the vehicle has passed its user validation trials, and is now on its basic field trials and doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--video paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
            
        &lt;div class="video-relative"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="overlay"&gt;
                &lt;div class="paragraph-image-wrapper" style="background-image: url()"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption"&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=1542"&gt;Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the Secretary of State update the House on the status of the Ajax procurement programme? I understand that the supply chain is being geared up to produce 589 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;memberId=1539"&gt;The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ben Wallace)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my right hon. Friend will know, the Ajax was decided on in, I think, March 2010, under a Labour Government. As I have often said, it has been a troubled programme. Since I have taken over this office, we have sought to rectify the issue on almost a weekly basis, and with the determination of both the former Minister for Defence Procurement, my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Jeremy Quin), and the current Minister, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Alex Chalk). The vehicle has passed its user validation trials and is now undergoing its basic field trials. It is doing extremely well, and I am given a weekly update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the programme is being delayed—and we are doing our best to rectify that—overall it has not cost a single extra penny, because the contract, which was agreed under the Conservative Government after the selection of the vehicle by the Labour party, involved a fixed price. Yes, the programme is being delayed, but we are fixing it, and it is showing good progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-03-13/debates/e5fb4834-724e-4ada-a4ac-07ad714dcaf0/CommonsChamber#contribution-5D9F4007-C1EB-4859-884E-065ACAB5D865"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil demands that additional support for households is announced in this week’s UK Government Spring Budget.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil says a comprehensive package of support is needed including the continuation of the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payments for all families that currently receive them, beyond March, and an immediate U-turn on Tory plans to raise people’s energy bills by a further £500 from April.</p>



<p>6 out of 10 households in the Outer Hebrides are classed as being in fuel poverty. A household is said to be in fuel poverty when its members cannot afford to keep adequately warm at a reasonable cost, given their income.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “After thirteen years of Tory cuts, Brexit damage and economic failure, the UK government must deliver a Budget which will support families instead of making households even poorer.</p>



<p>“Scotland is a wealthy, energy-rich country but families are paying an unacceptable high price under Westminster control as living costs soar, real wages tumble, and inflation goes through the roof.</p>



<p>“Energy bills need to be cut by at least £500, following Scotland’s lead with higher public sector pay deals, and introducing a Real Living Wage for all workers.</p>



<p>“The £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payments must continue for all families that currently receive them.</p>



<p>“With the wholesale price of gas falling, the UK government is already saving billions of pounds.</p>



<p>“If the Chancellor follows the SNP’s demands to scrap non-dom tax status, tax share buy backs, and expand the windfall tax, he could raise billions more to benefit ordinary families.</p>



<p>“An independent Scotland would have already acted long ago. The fact that the Tories are still refusing to help families, shows exactly why Scotland needs the full powers of independence.”</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has also called for the UK Government to increase to the Rural Fuel Rebate from 5p a litre to 10p a litre in this week’s Budget.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-236443" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/metrolink-closure-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/metrolink-closure-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/metrolink-closure-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/metrolink-closure-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/metrolink-closure-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/metrolink-closure.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPs representing constituencies in Tameside have been granted permission to be heard by the HS2 Bill Committee and fight against the mothballing of the Ashton Metrolink line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the HS2 (Crewe &amp;#8211; Manchester) Bill, HS2 Ltd are proposing the closure of the Ashton Metrolink line for a period of at least two years to facilitate construction. This is despite an alternative proposal being put forward by Transport for Greater Manchester, which would allow the line to continue to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPs Angela Rayner, Jonathan Reynolds and Andrew Gwynne slammed the possibility of the closure, and vowed to fight against it in Parliament. They were challenged, however, by HS2 Ltd, who claimed that Tameside constituencies would not be &amp;#8216;directly affected&amp;#8217; by the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three MPs attended a &amp;#8216;right to be heard&amp;#8217; hearing on Tuesday, to argue the case that their constituencies would be directly affected by the proposals, and they should be heard by the Committee. They were joined by the leader of Tameside Council Ged Cooney, as well as MP for Blackley and Broughton Graham Stringer, who is also arguing to be heard by the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deliberation, the Bill committee decided that Andrew Gwynne and Angela Rayner should be allowed to state their case in full to the Bill Committee, with Jonathan Reynolds being called as a witness due to the construction works falling just beyond the boundary of his constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a joint statement, Angela Rayner, Jonathan Reynolds and Andrew Gwynne said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are pleased that the committee has seen sense and decided that the elected representatives of Tameside do have a right to be heard. We were never in doubt that we had a right to speak up for our constituents and should not have been challenged by HS2 Ltd in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While we are disappointed that Jonathan hasn&amp;#8217;t been granted full right to be heard, we appreciate the committee&amp;#8217;s decision to allow him to be called as a witness, where he will make a robust case about the impact the closure of the Metrolink line will have on his constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The decision to mothball the Ashton Metrolink line would have disastrous consequences for all our constituencies, severing a vital transport link for local people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;TfGM have suggested an alternative proposal, which would allow construction to continue without damaging our constituencies. HS2 Ltd should do the right thing and work with local authorities during this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll continue to stand up for our constituents as this Bill progresses.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Weekly Round-Up :: 10 March 2023</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/03/13/weekly-round-up-10-march-2023/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-10-march-2023" type="text/html"/>

<p>This week the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) met to question the Institute for Government about the value of the Civil Service People Survey and whether the results are used effectively by government departments to address the concerns raised by civil servants. In the past the PCS, the civil service’s largest union, has expressed concerns that departments have failed to follow-up on staff issues. Issues around bullying and harassment in the civil service have made headlines in recent years. The civil service work closely with Government and are an important part of the functioning of society. The people who work there must feel valued and that their concerns are addressed when they are raised. For the best functioning Government and public service, we need people who feel safe and secure in their work and who are not afraid to raise concerns about any aspect of their working life so that inefficiencies or abuses may be resolved. </p>
<p>We marked International Women’s Day this week. It is a day to celebrate the wonderful achievements of the women in our lives and women in society but also to consider some of the threats and inequalities that women continue to face in society. From domestic abuse to the gender pay gap, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve true equality. </p>
<p>In the week of International Women’s Day, it is a good time to reaffirm the message about the importance of breast screening. At a drop in in Parliament this week, I spoke to people who had been affected by breast cancer and heard about their experiences. I also was able to speak to healthcare professionals about what they see and what changes they want to ensure that more people are screened so that signs of cancer can be identified earlier to improve outcomes. Everyone registered as female with a GP will be invited automatically for breast screening from the age of 50, however, if you are concerned about any changes in your breasts and you are not yet 50, it is important that you contact your GP to ensure that you are checked over. For more information, visit the NHS website.</p>
<p>Continuing the theme of International Women’s Day, I went today to Venturer’s Academy to talk about women in politics to the students there and then was able to speak with some of the older students about the realities of working in politics. There are some truly fantastic female parliamentarians doing incredible work for their constituencies and for wider society as a whole. It was great to talk to these young students and answer their questions about what it is like to work in politics.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall be joining the Bristol Women’s Voice International Women’s Day event, “A Caring Economy for Bristol: Who Cares Wins” to discuss what needs to be done to put care at the heart of Bristol’s economy and what we need to do collectively to make that happen. It is heartening to see the awareness among people in Bristol of the importance of the care sector – both from a humane perspective and from an understanding of the economic sense it provides. We want to see good jobs in the care sector in Bristol as well as help people recuperate from illness at home and to maintain their independence in life. I look forward to meeting everyone tomorrow and to discussing this very timely issue. </p>
<p>If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/03/13/weekly-round-up-10-march-2023/">Weekly Round-Up :: 10 March 2023</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

<p><em><strong>This article was written by John for AltFi, a leading magazine on alternative finance and fintech</strong></em></p>



<p>At the start of the year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt gave his first big speech about how he’s going to get Britain growing faster. </p>



<p>It was his first chance to present a vision for the future and to highlight the strengths of the UK economy, especially in areas like digital technology, AI, fintech, life sciences and green energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, there is an immediate, urgent priority to bring down inflation, but growth is a long-term essential too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with the Government’s finances under huge strain after a pandemic and an energy crisis in quick succession, he won’t have much scope in his upcoming budget to get things moving by turning on the taps of Government spending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with much less fiscal firepower than usual, supply-side reforms to unblock the arteries of our economy will be his main option for faster growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, in 2021, I published a Government-commissioned report which has loads of precisely these types of ideas, so he will have plenty of options to choose from. It was called&nbsp;<em>Power To The People</em>&nbsp;and made about 30 recommendations on how to make Britain more internationally cutting-edge and competitive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just recently I’ve published an update called Unfinished Revolution which works out which of the original 30 ideas are still waiting to be done (the answer is ‘about half’) and adds a few new ones to reflect what’s changed because of the pandemic and war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest and most profound economic disruption is digitisation. Yes, there are obvious benefits as things become faster, cheaper and more convenient, but there are downsides too. We’ve got to work out how to handle huge new digital data monopolies and deal with the question of whether consumers and businesses understand the value of their data too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last time we updated our competition rules, firms like Amazon, Uber and Apple didn’t exist, so it’s good news that Government Ministers are planning to deal with the digital monopolies through a specialist unit in the Competition and Markets Authority too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the single most valuable and important change ought to be something called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.altfi.com/companies/smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart&nbsp;</a>Data, which could be a game changer if we handle it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.altfi.com/companies/smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart&nbsp;</a>Data is about putting consumers and businesses directly in charge of their own data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of it like this, the Government, banks, supermarkets, energy providers and pretty much any company or organisation we deal with day-to-day sit on lots of data about what we buy, how much we earn or where we like to travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.altfi.com/companies/smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart&nbsp;</a>Data is about giving each of us the right to make our information portable.</p>



<p>A good example is open banking, a proven British success story that is helping millions of small businesses and consumers by transforming the way we pay for things, how we apply for credit and keeping on top of our finances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has helped turbocharge our fintech industry even more. But why shouldn’t it be extended beyond banking and into “open everything” by including insurance, pensions, energy or online shopping too?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key to all of this is a new piece of legislation, the upcoming Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. It’s a promising start, but it’s tentative: it won’t get us to open everything, because it doesn’t go far or fast enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other countries aren’t standing still either. They’ve seen the phenomenal success of open banking and, unsurprisingly, they’d like some of what we’ve got too. If we don’t get a move on, they won’t just copy what we’ve done already; they’ll leapfrog and overtake us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have an opportunity to use this as a mechanism to make us more ambitious and move from open banking to ‘open everything’ as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we do, it will maintain our global leadership, create thousands more valuable, world-beating UK-based start-up firms and mean the industries and skills of the future would be created right here.</p>



<p>When the Chancellor stands up to deliver his Spring Budget in Parliament next month, I’m sure he will be proud of the innovation in new and high-tech sectors of our economy. ‘Open Everything’ can and should be one of them.</p>

<p>The Works and Pensions Select Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into jobs. There are three main issues.: shortages in key areas affecting growth and outcomes, too few people with the right skills, and deprivation which limits opportunity.</p>



<p>Our inquiry is considering how other countries are dealing with these problems. One of our biggest concerns is the shortage and future shortfall of nurses and other NHS staff.</p>



<p>Labour has rightly identified training more doctors and nurses as a key priority and will pay for it by taxing non-doms, rich people who enjoy the benefits of living in our country but avoid paying tax. However, the inquiry has led me to conclude that, vital though that is, it won’t be enough.</p>



<p>In the USA, which has quite a different health and care system, they are experiencing remarkably similar problems over recruitment and retention of nurses. President Biden’s administration is embarking on an ambitious apprenticeship scheme to encourage new nurses. They’ll be paid apprentices from day one, so no loans and no debt, such a deterrent to those from poorer backgrounds, especially after our government scrapped bursaries for student nurses. There aren’t enough training places for the number of nurses needed. The Americans plan to tackle that by recruiting experienced nurses as trainers and mentors, which also addresses retention issues caused by experienced nurses leaving the profession through excessive pressure and lack of job satisfaction.</p>



<p>It’s an obvious way to encourage new recruits and reduce prohibitive entry requirements. Like other apprenticeships, it will largely consist of on-the-job training, often thought to be lacking in current programmes. It’s a wonderful opportunity to increase the number of nurses in our hospitals. No doubt we’ll hear some opposition or claims that there’s already an apprenticeship route, but I’m talking about something much bigger and a programme that’s much more accessible. I want a modern version of the old pupil nurse route.</p>



<p>We need to make it easier for people, especially those from disadvantaged areas, to enter the profession. We need a modern health service but, like matrons, we need apprentice/pupil nurses as part of that modern NHS.</p>

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-11/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with a further update about a number of local matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epsom &amp;amp; Ewell Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a reminder about the deadline for the consultation on the local plan for Epsom and Ewell Borough. You have until March 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to take part in the consultation and to give your view about what is proposed. It is really important that everyone takes part, as the plan is highly controversial and involves developing a large area of green belt land in Epsom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan includes building 1500 homes on the Horton Farm site, the area of farmland between Horton Lane and Hook Road, building residential blocks on the playing fields next to Ewell East station and building homes on part of the Hook Road arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have submitted a response which continues to argue for the redevelopment of the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas as a mixed use area. This could provide more homes than the Council’s plans for local green belt. Contrary to what some of you may have heard, the outline plan also envisages retaining the same amount of commercial space as at present. All the details are on my website &lt;a href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/shaping-the-right-plan-for-epsom-and-ewell-a-proposal-from-chris-grayling/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also going to be a special Council meeting about the plan on &lt;strong&gt;March 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Although I imagine that the public gallery will be packed, you will also be able to watch the meeting online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of how to respond to the consultation are at &lt;a href="http://www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk"&gt;www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; . Information about how to log in and watch the Council meeting will be on the website at this address a few days before the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://democracy.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=146&amp;amp;MId=1462&amp;amp;Ver=4"&gt;https://democracy.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=146&amp;amp;MId=1462&amp;amp;Ver=4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mole Valley Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who live in Mole Valley, the latest on its local plan is that the process has been paused to wait for the revised national policy on green belt land. I spoke at the planning enquiry and asked for a reduction to the amount of green belt land proposed for development in Ashtead. I hope that when the new policy is launched the plan will be modified accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ewell East Train Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people have been in touch with me about the reduction in train services at Ewell East. I have been pursuing this with Southern, and they have agreed to restore the half hourly service at peak times. This will mean six additional trains stopping at Ewell East when the new timetable starts in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are still issues around crowding on the Waterloo line and I am continuing to push on this. The arrival of the new ten coach trains, which is due this year, will I hope make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horton &amp;#8211; Local Centre Parking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of people have raised concerns with me about the way that the car park is being operated at the Horton local centre, with complaints about the way that people are being penalised for visiting the shops. I have raised concerns with the owners of the site, and they have agreed to improve the signage so that it is much clearer which spaces are available for shoppers. I would still advise taking care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Veterans Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a former member of the armed forces, I have been asked to let you know that there is an active and growing veterans group locally. It organises a range of activities for veterans, and all are welcome to join. If you are interested please contact Barb Warwich of the local branch of the British Legion, &lt;a href="mailto:barb.warwick@virginmedia.com"&gt;barb.warwick@virginmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Age Concern Volunteers Needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been asked by the local Age Concern team to let you know that they are in need of both volunteer drivers, and also people who are interested in joining their Trustee board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers are needed to take older people from the Borough of Epsom and Ewell to medical appointments, or to visit family of friends in hospital or residential homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a regular weekly commitment or on an ad-hoc basis.  A mileage allowance of 50p per mile is paid and they will need to undertake a DBS clearance for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role is of interest or if you would like more information, please contact Jane Hodgson, Volunteer Co-ordinator on 01372 728458 or by email &lt;a href="mailto:jane.hodgson@ageconcernepsom.org.uk"&gt;jane.hodgson@ageconcernepsom.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Trustee Roles they would particularly like to hear from you if you have a background in law, business strategy, marketing, fundraising, or social care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, please send a copy of your current CV along with a covering letter detailing your skills, experience and motivation for applying to Dorah May Hancock, Chief Officer, Age Concern Epsom and Ewell by email to &lt;a href="mailto:dorahmay.hancock@ageconcernepsom.org.uk"&gt;dorahmay.hancock@ageconcernepsom.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; or contact her on 01372 732458 for an informal discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-87/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="font-weight: 400;">The week started with the very sad news that the former <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1630218007015223297?cxt=HHwWgsCz6fuo2Z8tAAAA">first female Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, Betty Boothroyd had passed away on Sunday 26th February. Betty was a remarkable woman, who was firm but fair, and presided over many very important historic debates in the Chamber, including the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. Betty became a Baroness in 2001, and sat as a crossbench peer, which is the convention for former Speakers. I had the honour to meet Betty when she was Madam Speaker, and when I became an MP in 2015 I spoke to Betty on many occasions when she was in the tea room. Betty commanded massive admiration, huge respect, and her contribution to democracy will never diminish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended many events this week, which started with the excellent Bevan Foundation and Cost of Living Crisis Briefing event that focused on the housing crisis. Wales is in the middle of a housing and cost of living crisis, greater numbers of households are struggling to live. The Bevan Foundation has researched the role that the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) plays in creating and perpetuating homelessness and housing insecurity in Wales. The LHA is the mechanism used to calculate the amount of Housing Benefit or housing element of Universal Credit (UC) that someone renting in the private rental sector is entitled to claim. The determining factors are: allowing a tenant to rent in the cheapest 30% of a market area; the location of the property (there are 23 Broad Rental Market Areas in Wales); the number of bedrooms; and a separate calculation for shared properties for under 35s with no dependents. The Bevan Foundation’s latest findings show that only 24 properties were available at or below the LHA in May 2022 in Wales and the situation has significantly worsened since 2022, which makes the need for the UK Government to take action to uprate the LHA – whose rates have been frozen since 2020 and does not reflect the rise in rental costs since 2020 – which is absolutely crucial to improve the rental market in Wales. I have been a member of the Bevan Foundation for many years, and support the marvellous research work that they do to highlight the crises facing many families and individuals in Wales. I fully support campaigning for the UK Government to reform the LHA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every year I attend the drop-in for <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1631217783378780161?cxt=HHwWgoC9mc77n6MtAAAA">World Book Day</a>, whose mission is to offer every child and young person the opportunity to read and love books by giving free books to children so that they have a book of their own. When children read in their spare time they are happier, improve reading skills, and are more successful in school. Adults are encouraged to help children by reading to them, having books at home, letting children choose what they want to read, making time for reading and most of all, making it fun. Unfortunately, I didn’t have these opportunities as a child, so I have been passionate about reading since becoming an adult. I spoke about my passion for murder mysteries, my interest in forensic science, and the pleasure of discovering a new author, and then reading their entire back catalogue. My latest discovery is Sharon Bolton, who I recommend to anyone interested in a book with a good and unconventional murder plot. All her books are different and gripping!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was proud to be re-elected as chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism at our AGM, and very pleased that The Vegan Society and Vegetarian for Life have agreed to continue as secretariat. My thanks to all the parliamentarians who continue to support this APPG.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering, and Cosmetology, I met the outgoing Registrar of The Hair Council, Keith Conniford, to thank him for the many years of dedicated service that he has given to the hair sector. I also met the new Registrar Gareth Penn, who I am sure will be as diligent as Keith in representing all areas of the hair sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Vegetarianism and Veganism APPG, and the Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology APPG, will be holding their first joint event in the near future with speakers representing each APPG discussing the availability and quality of hair products for vegetarians and vegans.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I must be one of the few teetotallers who attended the Long Live the Local drop-in event. My parents and grandparents managed a variety of public houses and RFCs when I was a child, so my support for locals is historical, and there are many locals in my constituency that provide traditional services, but some have expanded to be a hub providing added help for people who for example those struggling with heating and internet provisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was in the Chamber to listen to the Prime Minister delivering his statement on the Northern Ireland Protocol, in which he announced that The Windsor Framework (TWF) would deliver free-flowing trade with the whole of the UK and protect Northern Ireland’s place in our Union, and that it also safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland. The PM stated that it preserves the delicate balance of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, removing thousands of EU laws and making permanent legally binding to the protocol treaty. The majority of Conservatives supported TWF, apart from the European Reform Group (ERG) and the DUP who expressed serious reservations and stated that they would look at the details of the proposal and take time before coming to a decision.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The two Official Opposition Day debates featured: expanding the NHS Workforce and Getting Britain Back to Work. The Labour Party pushed the first debate to a vote at the conclusion of the debate, and won by 224-0 because the Tories did not take part in the vote. The second debate concluded at 7pm and the Labour Party did not push it to a vote.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As vice-chair for the APPG for Restorative Justice I attended a discussion on the recently released HMPPS Restorative Justice Policy Framework (RJPF) which has raised concerns with members of the APPG, its Advisory Board, and the wider RJ sector about the ability of services to deliver effectively on the ground. UK Government and Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) investment over the last 7 years has produced expertise and success for restorative justice, and a recent economic evaluation found there is evidence that there are cost benefits for reducing reoffending and delivering victim satisfaction of £14 for every £1 spent on restorative justice. The key recommendations from our APPG Summer 2021 Enquiry into Restorative Justice included automatics rights for victims through the Victim’s Law and making restorative justice more accessible by ending blanket bans. Elements of the RJPF will impact negatively on victims, particularly those who are victims of serious crimes, and suggests that prisons and probation services are not required to comply with the Victims Code of Practice. Any person on probation reporting as a victim must be given information about local restorative justice services, but there is no requirement for victims under HMPPS to be proactively given information, and the British Crime Survey states that only 5% of victims are aware of restorative justice. The RJPF is not clear on training for offender managers and probation practitioners who will be tasked with explaining restorative justice. There are nine limitations listed, including hate crime, extremism, domestic abuse and sexual offending, which suggests that victims of these crimes will not have access to restorative justice. The chair of our APPG, Elliot Colburn MP, will be writing to the Secretary of State for Justice seeking clarification on our concerns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to be re-elected as a vice chair of the Acquired Brain Injury APPG at its AGM. Chris Bryant MP was re-elected as chair. We had presentations from Chloe Hayward, UK Acquired Brain Injury Trust, and Davina Jones, Disability Trust, a charity which now focuses totally on brain injuries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lovely early morning start to St David’s Day when Mr Speaker held an outdoor service at Old Palace Yard. A children’s choir aged 3-11, dressed in Welsh costumes, sang Dewi Sant, and all the Parliamentarians, staff, and parents, sang the Welsh National Anthem when the Welsh Flag was raised. It reminded me of when I went to school dressed in my Welsh costume on St David’s Day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I always support Marie Curie events, and I called in to the drop-in to support its Great Daffodil Appeal 2023. Marie Curie is the leader in end-of-life experience in the UK, and provides a better life for people living with terminal illness, and their families, offering expert care in homes, and its nine hospices. Last year Marie Curie provided direct support to over 66,000 people. The Great Daffodil Appeal is in its 37th year, and people from all over the UK come together to raise funds so that Marie Curie can continue working on the front line giving expert care. This week I was proud to wear my Marie Curie daffodil and extra proud on St David’s Day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was fortunate to draw number nine in <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1630976195566374913?cxt=HHwWgsDQ3ayNsqItAAAA">Wales Questions</a>, and very fortunate that Mr Speaker called me as the last question before PMQs. Unfortunately, it was the Minister James Davies MP, and not the Secretary of State for Wales, David T C Davies MP, who answered my question, which prevented me from referring to the fact that David T C Davies was the previous chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee. However, I ploughed on and asked whether he would urge his Conservative colleagues to accept the Welsh Affairs Committee’s recommendation that HS2 is reclassified as an England-only project which would result in Wales receiving Barnett Consequentials estimated at £5 billion and would allow the Welsh Labour Government to continue to expand public transport services, and people in Wales can receive the same benefits from HS2 as those in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Minister replied that HS2 is the backbone of Britain’s rail infrastructure and it’s important for Wales to plug into and take advantage of it, but he didn’t explain how that would happen.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG for Ukraine, chaired by Alex Sobel MP, and listened to updates from charity workers on the frontline in Ukraine. Emily Tripp, Director of Airwars, which is a not-for-profit transparency watchdog which tracks, assesses, archives and investigates civilian harm claims, resulting primarily from explosive weapons used in conflict affected nations. Founded in 2014, Airwars has tracked over 66,000 locally alleged civilian deaths.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Newton, Regional Director (Europe) of the Halo Trust, which is the world’s largest de-mining charity, said that it is doubling its staff in Ukraine this year as it faces an epochal challenge to clear liberated areas of explosives. After a huge training program, it is hoping to have around 1,200 staff by this summer. It is impossible to know how many mines, rockets, and shells require to be disposed of, but it is likely to take decades. Mike said that over 125 minefields have been identified in northern Ukraine. Up to now, anti-vehicle mines have been prevalent, but personnel mines and booby traps are emerging in areas that have been recaptured by Ukrainian troops.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Spoerri, Head of Regional Delegation for UK and Ireland International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said that they have been working in Ukraine since 2014, and have massively upscaled its response since the Russian invasion. ICRC has over 700 staff working in 10 locations across Ukraine to deliver relief items to the displaced, provide medical supplies to health care facilities, restore water supply for millions of people, and other lifesaving activities. It is hard to exaggerate the toll that the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had on civilians in recent months, on top of 8 years armed conflict in Donestk and Luhansk. Civilians have been killed, injured, lost homes, loved ones, poured into neighbouring countries, or stayed and lived in underground shelters. Homes, schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. The ICRC estimates that over 17 million people need humanitarian help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine Country Director of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) told us that the survey they conducted has demonstrated the devastating impact the conflict has had on the people of Ukraine. With the bitter winter, 27% people said they had insufficient heating, 93% said they could not meet basic needs. What families need is protection, safety and warmth, access to humanitarian assistance to survive, and economic support to rebuild lives in the future. To date the IRC and its partners has reached over half a million people with critical humanitarian assistance, providing support directly to displaced families to buy food, children’s clothes, and pay bills; helping older people to teach medical facilities and heat homes; and help with acute anxiety, stress, and trauma. Marysia emphasised that we must never forget Ukraine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Ceramics APPG meeting to discuss how the recently launched Commission for Carbon Competitiveness can work with the Ceramics industry. The Commission is a cross-party and cross-industry effort to explore how the industry can achieve net zero without undermining the competitiveness of British industry. The Commission is chaired by Conservative MP John Penrose, and Stephen Kinnock MP is the Labour representative. The aims of the Commission are to examine imports where environmental standards are lower than in the UK, so have a high level of carbon, and has a cost advantage. And focus on carbon which is produced abroad and piped into the UK and the implication of introducing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in the UK.</p>

    <title>Inspiring International Women’s Day Event</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/inspiring-international-womens-day-event/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=inspiring-international-womens-day-event" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last week, I was privileged to chair a constituency event to mark International Women&amp;#8217;s Day. A packed auditorium of young girls listened attentively to the talented and inspiring women on the panel, all of whom kindly took time out of their busy lives to share their stories of success and, sometimes, struggle, competing in male-dominated professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;International Women&amp;#8217;s Day (IWD) is celebrated annually on 8 March as a global day focussing on the women&amp;#8217;s rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women. This year my team and I decided to use our platform to host a panel of inspiring local women for young girls to hear about their career journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that median hourly pay for full-time employees was 8.3% less for women than for men in April 2022. According to the World Economic Forum, it will take 268 years to close the economic gender gap – clearly, we have a long way to go, making events like these as important as ever. Young people, especially girls, can find themselves under pressure in the judgemental world of social media on top of the challenge of finding their way in the world of work, often steered towards a lower-paid career. Seeing the young folk in the room inspired by the incredible women on the panel was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Former RAF Nimrod pilot, Kirsty Harding, talked of motherhood &amp;#8211; whilst serving in an active war zone. Freda Newton, who is not only a hugely successful business woman but also a well-respected thought leader in the tourism sector, kindly shared her experiences of building successful businesses and spoke of the trial of surviving a pandemic immediately after a massive investment in her company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Clare Humphrey, founder of Will to Win, gave the perspective of a life coach, while Danielle Nicolson talked candidly about women and politics. Libby Macdonald, an advocate for fair work in social care and real living wage campaigner, spoke of her experiences in the care sector. Cecilia Grigor gave her insights on building a business in the digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I want to thank them for sharing their stories to inspire the young audience. After the event, there were many requests to take selfies and follow-up chats, which clearly showed their impact on the young audience. It was rewarding to see inspiring women, inspiring a whole generation of inspiring women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I also recently held cost-of-living surgeries across the constituency, including in Aviemore. I was grateful to the organisations who joined me at these events to help local folk struggling to make ends meet. If you need help, my team and I are always here to listen and help. You can book a meeting, a call or email me on my website at &lt;a href="http://www.drewhendrymp.scot"&gt;www.drewhendrymp.scot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before I finish, I want to give you a quick update on my It&amp;#8217;s Your Money campaign calling on energy suppliers to treat people fairly, especially to stop hoarding customers&amp;#8217; credit balances. Since raising this issue, many people have been in touch to tell me that they have discovered they are in credit, sometimes with sums over £1000. Digging further into this unfairness has exposed a litany of failures and suspect practices. Rest assured, I will continue to press for fair treatment for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;

    <title>Put an end to postcode lottery for bone health, demands Judith</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/put-an-end-to-postcode-lottery-for-bone-health-demands-judith-cummins-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cummins MP on Tuesday called for the government to step up and provide 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services in England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a long-term health condition characterised by weak bones prone to breaking or fracture. It affects 3.5m people across the UK: a fifth of men and half of women over 50.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A report by the Royal Osteoporosis Society found that 90,000 people miss out on the treatment every year and some 2.2 million people in the UK are left with undiagnosed spinal fractures. Fracture Liaison Services&amp;nbsp;are an essential means of identifying and treating osteoporosis early. Yet, only 57% of people in England have access to this quality of life improving service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the Chamber, Judith called on the government to provide the necessary services, which could prevent over thirty thousand hip fractures by identifying bone problems early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An investment of just £27 million per year in Fracture Liaison Services would deliver over £600 million in savings over five years for the NHS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Will the Minister meet with me and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, to discuss our report, and commit to ending the postcode lottery by providing 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services for over-50s in England?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding, Secretary of State for Health Steve Barclay MP agreed: “Obviously, she sets out a very compelling case in terms of the return on investment. Clearly, we will need to scrutinise that in more detail.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_03_07-FLS-ROS-Health-Q.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Judith hears from the Health Secretary there is a &amp;#8216;compelling case&amp;#8217; for investing in FLS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking afterwards, Judith emphasized the need to act now to ensure that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and people are not unnecessarily left in pain with debilitating fractures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bradford has an exemplary fracture liaison service, but almost half of the country must do without. When these early opportunities to prevent fractures are missed there is a greater pressure on ambulances, acute hospital bed days, and greater stress on the NHS.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By acting now to provide full Fracture Liaison Services coverage right across England, we can save people unnecessary pain, save the NHS vital resources, and give all patients the level of care they deserve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Llanelli Star Column – How Pension Credit can be a welcome boost</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://niagriffith.org.uk/2023/02/llanelli-star-column-how-pension-credit-can-be-a-welcome-boost/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Many pensioners across Carmarthenshire may be losing out on vital Pension Credit help that could bring an average of £2,700 extra into their homes every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated
£5million worth of Pension Credit annually goes unclaimed in the county which
during this cost of living crisis could be used by local people to help make
ends meet.&amp;nbsp; It is a nationwide problem
too with one million households thought to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pension Credit
provides extra cash to those who are over State Pension age and on low incomes.&amp;nbsp; It is separate from the State Pension and you
might be able to qualify even if you have other income, savings or if you’re a
homeowner.&amp;nbsp; It can also act as a
“gateway” benefit which opens doors to additional help with housing costs,
council tax, TV licences and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is the most
underclaimed benefit of all and around a quarter of those eligible to claim do
not do so, missing out on support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I’m
determined to encourage as many local residents who think they might qualify to
apply.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently held
an event at the Selwyn Samuel Centre to raise awareness of Pension Credit which
attracted over 150 people, with experts from the Citizens Advice Bureau, DWP
and other organisations on hand to help.&amp;nbsp;
Anyone who thinks that they, or a loved one, may be eligible for Pension
Credit should find out more about it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claims can be
made online at &lt;a href="http://www.gov.uk/pension"&gt;www.gov.uk/pension&lt;/a&gt; credit or by phone on 0800 99 1234. &amp;nbsp;If you need help in submitting a claim then my
office is happy to assist and can put you in contact with a specialist advisor to
take you through the process.&amp;nbsp; Please get
in touch on 01554 756374 or email &lt;a href="mailto:nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk"&gt;nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my February email newsletter. It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks since the start of the year in Parliament, and I&#8217;ve been pleased to raise local and national issues in the House on issues such as pensions, road improvements and recycling/waste changes, which you can find more about below. I&#8217;ve also included some local updates on projects such as the Heanor High Streets Fund works and the long-awaited installation of step-free access at Alfreton, as well as access to health appointments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there are any issues you&#8217;d like to discuss further or that I can help with, please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch via the contact details at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>War in Ukraine – President Zelensky visit</u></strong></p>



<p>In Westminster we had the great honour of welcoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to give an address to parliament. He spoke about bravery when faced with the horrors of war, praising the courage of the men and women in Ukraine who are defending their country, and highlighting how the people of the United Kingdom embody these values themselves. It was a moving yet tongue-in-cheek speech, demonstrating that the Ukrainians share the classically British sense of humour in the face of adversity.</p>



<p>We should be incredibly proud of the support we have given to Ukraine, and the impact that we have made in helping them to defend their country. I wholeheartedly support the Government’s efforts to support Ukraine, and the equipment and training which has been provided to the Ukrainian military. It is right that the United Kingdom continues to stand up for freedom and democracy on the world stage, and to defend these values as we have done before.</p>



<p>I will be speaking to Radio Derby about the war in Ukraine as part of their coverage of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion.</p>



<p><strong><u>Pensions debates update</u></strong></p>



<p>We’ve certainly had the time to cover pensions over the last few weeks in the House of Commons. As part of my role on the Work and Pensions Committee, I’ve had the chance to speak at length in a number of debates on various aspects of pensions, and the future of our pension system.</p>



<p>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February, I chaired a Backbench Business debate on State Pension Age. We had cross-party consensus in favour of postponing a further increase to the state pension age, and discussions were had on life-expectancy in the UK. I argued the case that any further increases must consider differing effects of manual vs professional workers, and high-earners vs those who earn the least. Given the consensus against a further increase to 68, I urged the Government to factor our discussion into their upcoming review of the State Pension Age.</p>



<p>On the 6<sup>th</sup> of February, the House of Commons debated the plans to uprate pensions and benefits with inflation. I spoke strongly in favour of benefits and pensions increasing by 10% in line with inflation and argued further that there needs to be a review to work out whether the benefits and pensions given to individuals across the UK are in line with their expected living costs. Families and pensioners relying on Government support should be given enough to cover their basic needs and housing costs.</p>



<p>Finally, on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February, I attended a debate in Westminster Hall on protecting pension savers. Our discussion focused on ensuring self-employed people, gig-economy workers, full-time carers and women are all protected and supported in saving sufficiently for retirement. These groups have historically found it more difficult to save, and discussions were had on how to protect and improve their pensions. I spoke repeatedly about reforms to protect these vulnerable groups, and also on the Government new plans for an online dashboard, which will help people more easily track and plan their pension savings.</p>



<p>There are a number of changes on the way to modernise and improve the pension system, and to ensure not only that pensioners are appropriately supported in retirement, but that people are easily able to track their pensions and empowered to save sufficiently for their futures.</p>



<p>I am proud to be a part of these ongoing discussions about our pension system and the support provided to pensioners in the UK and you can find my recent contributions in the House in these debates in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-02-07b.247.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g251.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>APPG Cleaning &amp; Hygiene update</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of January I chaired a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cleaning and Hygiene. It was enlightening to speak to professionals working in cleaning services and the manufacturing of cleaning products about the industry and its importance in supporting out NHS and preventing the spread of disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was happy to be joined in this meeting by John Hines from SC Johnson Professional, who have a manufacturing plant in Denby.</p>



<p>The group was able to discuss our recent report on the role which the cleaning and hygiene industry can plan in pandemic resilience and response, as well as supporting the NHS and reducing the spread of winter flu. One of the outcomes of the report was to encourage people continue the good habits we all developed during the pandemic, which will help keep our homes and families safer and healthier.</p>



<p><strong><u>Junction 28 improvement works debate</u></strong></p>



<p>Whilst Junction 28 of the M1 isn’t directly in Amber Valley, the delays currently caused at peak times as a result of the daily congestion in this area regularly back up into our area, sometimes as far as Alfreton and Swanwick.</p>



<p>Neighbouring MP, Mark Fletcher, within whose Bolsover constituency J28 lies, is campaigning for a capacity upgrade to reduce congestions and delays, and I was pleased to support him and his campaign during a recent Westminster Hall debate in Parliament.</p>



<p>I took the opportunity to raise related issues such as noise from the A38, capacity on the roads and the importance of improvements to Junction 28 to driving growth as well as reducing the problems currently being caused.</p>



<p>You can read the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-01-11b.293.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g297.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Recycling &amp; EPR</u></strong></p>



<p>There will be a lot of changes to our waste and recycling systems coming forward over the next few years, to encourage less landfill and more recycling.</p>



<p>As a result, I recently raised a question in Parliament about the introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) for packaging, and the potential impacts of this. You can read my question and the Minister’s reply, as well as the debate in full, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2023-01-30.135354.h&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g135354.q0">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Heanor Future High Streets Fund project update</u></strong></p>



<p>Work is progressing on the Heanor Future High Streets Fund and regeneration projects. I’ve been pleased to join the programme board overseeing progress.</p>



<p>Final designs for the new Heanor marketplace have come forward and these are coming out to consultations on the 21<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> February at St Lawrence Church, as well as being recorded and available on the AVBC website shortly after. If you’d like more information on these, please contact <a href="mailto:regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk">regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, works is progressing on the plans for the regeneration of the former Heanor Grammar School into the Heanor Hub. The planning application is still live but essential works have been taking place to prevent the further deterioration of the building, with works to the roof and the removal of asbestos. I was pleased to recently visit the Grammar School to have a look around the site.</p>



<p>Finally, the remediation and regeneration of the land at Whysall Street as part of the brownfield regeneration fund is also moving forwards. Surveys have started, and a £1m grant has been secured to tidy up the site prior to turning it into 40 new affordable homes.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP &amp; dental appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have been in touch regarding access to GP and dental appointments. As one specific example, Brooklyn Medical Practice in Heanor has recently moved into the Royal Primary Care Trust.</p>



<p>I’m working to arrange update visits with them and other local GPs and dentists to discuss issues they may be facing, and feed back on issues which have been raised with me by constituents.</p>



<p>I also continue to regularly meet with our local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to discuss updates and hospital treatment updates/waiting lists with them.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to cash &amp; banking services – new deposit service announced for Ripley</u></strong></p>



<p>I know that access to cash and banking services is an issue many constituents have contacted me about, and whilst I can’t stop banks who sadly decide to close their high street branches, I have been regularly meeting with them to discuss this and maintaining access to banks for residents.</p>



<p>In addition to this, Link and Access to Cash UK are working on new ways to maintain banking services in our high streets.</p>



<p>As part of this, I’m pleased that Ripley was recently selected by Link to have a new shared deposit service in the town. This will provide consumers and businesses with convenient and accessible ways to deposit cash even if they cannot visit a bank branch.</p>



<p>I’m scheduling a meeting with Link to discuss this further, as well as access to cash in Amber Valley’s other towns, and I’ll keep you updated. Please let me know if you have any views or suggestions in the meantime though. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Step-free access for Alfreton Station update</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been in contact with Network Rail to chase updates on the long-awaited Alfreton Station access for all scheme, which is due for completion by April 2024.</p>



<p>Whilst I’m disappointed by the delays to date, I’m pleased by the progress that is now being seen, with work on the various reports and surveys now taking place. For instance, Network Rail are progressing the coal mining, topographical, ecological and drainage surveys which will then inform the final draft designs and plans.</p>



<p>I’m meeting with Network Rail over the next few weeks to get further updates and timetable information, which I’ll update you on in my next newsletter.</p>



<p><strong><u>Shared Prosperity Funding Success &#8211; £2.9 million additional funding for Amber Valley</u></strong></p>



<p>I’m pleased that confirmation has been received that the Borough Council is receiving £2.9 million in Government granting funding through the Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF). This is part of the Levelling Up agenda, and the funding will be spent across Amber Valley over the next few years.</p>



<p>In particular, projects which will receive investment include improvements to our town centres, new community sports and leisure facilities, including investment in our local parks and play areas. There will also be £240k for community and voluntary sector organisations to bid for to support specific projects and improvements.</p>



<p>Specific projects so far confirmed include a new skatepark for Heanor, shop front improvement grants and the installation of solar panels on our local leisure centres.</p>



<p><strong><u>Residents’ survey reminder</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been out and about across Amber Valley delivering a survey to as many residents as possible to ask for your views and priorities for this year ahead. If you haven’t received one yet, or if you haven’t completed it, please take just a couple of minutes to let me know your views on local and national issues online <a href="https://fs22.formsite.com/nmills002/form1/index.html">here</a>.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Boston Borough and East Lindsey District Councils have invited local organisations to submit expressions of interest for the funding.</strong></p>
<p>The UK Shared Prosperity fund and the Rural England Prosperity Fund have awarded £6.14 million and £2.62 million to East Lindsey and Boston respectively.</p>
<p>Welcoming the announcement, MP for Boston and Skegness Matt Warman said:</p>
<p>“This £8.76 million Shared Prosperity funding to Boston and East Lindsey comes on top of the £70.3 million Town Deals and £22.8 million in Levelling Up Funding and shows the Government’s commitment to Levelling Up Boston, East Lindsey and Lincolnshire as a whole. It represents a huge vote of confidence in the vision for regeneration and growth put forward by Boston and East Lindsey Councils and the Town Deal boards.</p>
<p>“The request for expressions of interest for projects meeting the three priorities of this latest fund is a great opportunity for even more local organisations to join in driving innovation, growth and community in our area.'”</p>
<p>The full bidding guide for the funding and the expression of interest form is available on the Council’s website at <a href="http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF">http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF</a> and <a href="http://www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF">www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF</a>.</p>

    <title>Our Letter to the Prime Minister on Fulfilling Dementia Commitments</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">We Demand that the Government <span style="color:#06396a;">Fulfils its Commitments on Dementia</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Today I joined Alzheimer’s Society Ambassadors Vicky McClure and Dame Arlene Phillips as well as Elliot Colburn MP and Ananga Moonesinghe, who lives with dementia, to deliver an open letter to PM Rishi Sunak at Downing Street, demanding the Government urgently fulfil their promises on dementia.</p>
<p>Launched by leading dementia charity Alzheimer’s Society, the open letter has been signed by over 36,000 members of the public and famous names including Choreographer Dame Arlene Philips and actor Vicky McClure. We were joined at the hand-in by my colleague on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, Vice-Chair Elliot Colburn MP, showing cross-party support. It urges Rishi Sunak to deliver on previous Conservative Party commitments to dementia and not let the UK’s biggest killer fall down the political agenda.</p>
<p>Previous Conservative Prime Ministers have actively committed to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. Now Rishi Sunak must deliver on promises to reform social care, double dementia research funding and release a ten-year plan for dementia which gives the condition the priority it deserves. The 36,000 people who signed the open letter are making themselves clear – they don’t just want to hear empty promises, they want to see action. People with dementia can’t and won’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates still sitting below pre-pandemic levels, national figures reveal people are waiting up to two years in some areas for a diagnosis, thereby missing out on vital treatment and support. Alzheimer’s Society research also shows three in five people affected by dementia struggled to get social care in the past year, with half of family carers revealing they ended up in crisis, such as rushing their loved one to A&amp;E due to lack of support</p>
<p>The charity is concerned the deepening workforce crisis in social care – with vacancies sitting at 165,000 – risks leaving people with dementia desperate for help while living costs soar. Alzheimer’s Society say it’s more important now than ever for the Government to prioritise dementia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Government has made many commitments on dementia, promising to deliver a ‘visionary ten-year plan’ for dementia, to reform the social care system and double spending on dementia research by 2024.  Alzheimer’s Society says the delivery of these will be transformational for the lives of the 900,000 people living with dementia but calls on the Government to urgently make these a reality to prevent a deepening crisis in dementia care.</p>
<p>This follows the news last year that a new drug, lecanemab, was shown to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this breakthrough will mean little if diagnosis rates remain stagnant and often inaccurate. This treatment works best for people with early Alzheimer’s disease. Without early and accurate diagnosis, we risk hopeful advancements like this having minimal effect.</p>

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

    <title>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd New Warehouse in Andover</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="pbs-main-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
