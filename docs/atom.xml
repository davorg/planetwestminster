<p>Things are tough for lots of people right across Tameside, and indeed across the whole country. With inflation rising, cost of living soaring, and energy bills reaching stratospheric levels, I totally understand that for many people its difficult to see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>Over the Easter weekend, I spent a lot of time thinking and reflecting on the current cost of living crisis. It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the deluge of difficulties that people are having to face. Whilst it is my job as an MP to push to Government to do more and to help people in Tameside, I am also struck by the incredible things that local people are doing to help one another.</p>
<p>Whenever I feel cynical and frustrated at the state of national politics, I’m always reminded of the incredible things that people are doing on a daily basis to make a difference.</p>
<p>Take Pauline Town, for example, who I’ve written about in the past. Pauline has been helping out homeless people and handing out free lunches from her pub, The Station in Ashton-under-Lyne, for almost a decade. She now has around 100 regulars and is doing incredible work in supporting people who would otherwise be ignored.</p>
<p>She was recently awarded an MBE, and I can’t think of anyone more deserving of the honour.</p>
<p>Tameside Council also have a useful list which sets out the current food support in the borough. This includes Tameside East Foodbank, as well as The Bread and Butter Thing, a charity that aims to make life more affordable for people on low incomes. There is also St Mary’s Church &amp; Community Food Bank in Haughton Green, which has grown into a three-times-a-week emergency food provision service for those across Tameside.</p>
<p>Of course, it almost goes without saying that these kinds of initiatives shouldn’t be necessary, and that people who need it should be supported by the Government. One day, I hope to see a day when they won’t be necessary. Until then, however, it is really inspiring to see local people stepping up and changing lives.</p>
<p>People like Pauline really inspire me, and I would encourage any residents who are watching this crisis unfold and feeling helpless, to get involved with the various volunteering groups across the community.</p>
<p>We are living in difficult times, but if we continue to stick together and look out for one another, we can and will make a difference.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>South Shropshire MP Philip Dunne has welcomed government plans to introduce a Natural History GCSE.</p>

<p>The Department for Education has launched its Sustainability and Climate Change Strategy, which includes the launch of a new natural History GCSE. The new Natural History qualification will enable young people to explore the world by learning about organisms and environments, environmental and sustainability issues, and gain a deeper knowledge of the natural world around them.</p>

<p>They will also develop the skills to help them carve a future career in the natural world if they wish to – for example observation, description, recording and analysis, through sustained and structured field study.</p>

<p>A Natural History GCSE was a recommendation to the government in a report published last year by the Environmental Audit Committee, which Mr Dunne chairs.</p>

<p>Reacting to the Education Secretary’s announcement of the launch of a Natural History GCSE and the Sustainability and Climate Change Strategy, Mr Dunne said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am delighted that the Government has accepted the Environmental Audit Committee’s recommendation to introduce a Natural History GCSE. Nature is in a fragile state in our country and nurturing our next generation of ecologists is critical if we are to turn the tide on the risk of extinctions across our natural world.</p>

<p>“While we have glorious countryside here in South Shropshire, fewer and fewer young people are spending time outside appreciating and learning about nature. A formal qualification can help build knowledge and instil a love and respect for the great outdoors. It can help inspire solutions, securing the health of important ecosystems and building our critically important green workforce.</p>

<p>“This is exactly the right sort of intervention needed to make lasting change and to launch young people who might choose the growing career prospects in ecology and nature.”</p>

<p>I was privileged to meet with Valentyna and her ten-year-old daughter over the weekend. They are refugees who have successfully negotiated the complexities of Britain&#8217;s sponsorship scheme for those fleeing atrocities in Ukraine.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re wonderful people, as are the Birmingham couple who have given them a home, but why have so few arrived and why is the system so complicated?</p>



<p>Refugees and immigrants aren&#8217;t the same. Refugees need a safe place because they are fleeing war, brutal regimes or violence because of their politics, religion or sexual beliefs, among many other things. Immigrants tend to move for economic reasons and other social and family considerations.</p>



<p>Our current Education Secretary was an Iraqi refugee who arrived here unable to speak English. He is a great example of what can be achieved with the right support, as are other members of the government whose parents were immigrants.</p>



<p>Our Prime Minister is Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, the full name reflecting his French, German and Turkish ancestors. It takes all kinds and with DNA testing, we increasingly find just what a diverse bunch we are.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s strange that the big story of the holy weekend should be the Home Secretary&#8217;s Rwanda plan which involves rounding up asylum seekers and transporting them 4,000 miles. It will cost so much that her top civil servants couldn&#8217;t justify it on &#8216;value for money&#8217; grounds and she&#8217;s had to personally approve it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d love to be able to work with her to tackle people smugglers who exploit desperate folk and put them to sea in unsafe dinghies but I doubt she&#8217;s really serious. This plan&#8217;s about headlines ahead of council elections, to distract from questions about the PM breaking his own laws.</p>



<p>People arriving in this country can go on to great things and there&#8217;s also a need to sort the genuine from the fraudulent but as we think about the people of Ukraine and their suffering, perhaps those in government need to adopt a more honest and generous ap</p>

    <title>Controlling public spending</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2022/04/21/controlling-public-spending-6/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There is renewed interest amongst Conservative MPs in value for money and controlling public spending. We have just lived through an extraordinary two years when public budgets were increased hugely to combat the virus, find a vaccine, set up a nationwide free test and trace system , boost benefits, pay furlough  incomes , subsidise businesses facing impaired trading and offer finance to business in difficulties from banned or restricted trading.</p>
<p>The first part of controlling spending is reversing all of these special  measures as the  economy  has now returned to its pre pandemic levels. This is largely done though the NHS budget needs to be fully adjusted to ensure enough of the expanded budget that remains goes to non covid work and to waiting  list reduction. As answers to my various questions have shown the NHS needs to do more to have a good manpower plan going forward, to recruit the extra  medical staff it needs to handle demand. It may need more beds just as I and others strove to get to handle the first covid wave  through the Nightingales.  It needs to reduce overhead and concentrate resources on the medical services at its core. Much of the task of raising productivity in the public sector, raising service quality and improving value for money needs to come from this crucial service which absorbs 40 % of the state budget.</p>
<p>The government should urgently review overseas aid to eliminate payments to countries supporting Russia and countries with space,nuclear weapons or other large armaments programmes.</p>
<p>The costs of providing initial  housing and other public provision for refugees should be charged to the overseas aid budget. The number of economic migrants should be controlled to allow a reduction in spending on additional social housing.</p>
<p>The government must work with the railway to make substantial reductions to the current very high level of subsidy. The Secretary of State is right to try to promote more use of the railway. The  U.K. will need to be realistic about ticket prices after his initial bargain promotions. It may be that more freight use of the railway is the quickest win for revenue and beneficial environmental impact, reducing road congestion.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Office Minister Jacob Rees Mogg is right to seek a slimmed civil service. Ending much new external recruitment , promoting from within and eliminating  posts would save substantial sums and boost productivity.</p>

<p>Last week Boris Johnson became the only Prime Minister in British history to be found guilty of breaking the law. On Tuesday he made a statement to the House of Commons on the fines issued to himself and the Chancellor as a result of attending an illegal gathering in Westminster.</p>
<p>His mealy-mouthed apology will have offered little comfort to those families in Leicester West who sacrificed so much to follow the rules. You can see the Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, respond to the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement in the video above or read his response <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-04-19/debates/2C3E878D-6ECB-4FF2-9E3A-7B134989EAA6/EasterRecessGovernmentUpdate#contribution-2FDFBE6F-A5E1-434C-96DE-137D0F985771">here.</a></p>
<p>Labour will force a vote this week on allowing a cross-party committee to investigate whether the Prime Minister misled Parliament about breaking covid rules. Conservative MPs should put the country first, and vote to support an investigation. You can see the motion Labour have tabled on this <a href="https://labourlist.org/2022/04/motion-calling-for-investigation-of-pm-over-misleading-parliament-published/">here</a></p>
<p>The Labour Party is clear. Britain deserves better than Boris Johnson. It&#8217;s time to bring decency, honesty and integrity back to our politics. The Prime Minister is not fit to govern. He must resign.</p>

    <title>Sovereign wealth fund’s interest in inter-island tunnels is a ‘transformative step’ says Isles MP </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/04/20/sovereign-wealth-funds-interest-in-inter-island-tunnels-is-a-transformative-step-says-isles-mp/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Inter-island fixed link tunnels could become a reality, says Isles MP Angus MacNeil after very positive discussions with a sovereign wealth fund from&amp;nbsp;the Middle East.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil, who is Chair of the House of Commons International Trade Committee, met with the Mubadala group of Abu Dhabi this week, and the issue of ferry replacement inter-island tunnels was raised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil informed the group that the Scottish Government were consulting on inter-island tunnels and received an instantly positive response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “They mentioned they were aware there was plenty of opportunities in Scotland in offshore wind and when I told them the Scottish Government was also consulting on inter-island tunnels, they showed immediate interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“The deputy chief executive Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi said ‘that’s it, we are going to Scotland’.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MacNeil said the project could follow the Faroese model, where ferry replacement tunnels up to 10km long linking islands are paid and financed by pension funds in Canada and sovereign wealth funds elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that as the tunnels would be a replacement for inter-island ferries, they would have fares in the way that ferries do and pointed out that the tunnels in the Faroes were already paying themselves off, with one paid off in 12 years instead of the expected 25. The Faroes are now building their fourth tunnel which is almost complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;He added: “The tunnels could be priced over 25 years and would be cheaper than the ferries are at the moment, plus they are available all the time regardless of the weather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there was a return on the investment, the finance would come and if the tunnels were priced over 25 years they would be cheaper than building and maintaining ferries.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil has pressed for many years for the potential of tunnels to the islands to be looked at. &amp;nbsp;In 2019, he worked directly with Norwegian consultant Norconsult over the feasibility of the project which suggested a tunnel between Harris and Skye as the best option with a possible additional inter-island link between Harris and North Uist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MacNeil said tunnels were a serious option for the islands as a means of reducing reliance on the ferry network and making savings in the long term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A range of major local employers will be in attendance, such as the NHS and Avon and Somerset Police, in addition to local businesses and organisations.  One Front Door which supports people to find work and training, and Future Bright, which helps people already in work to take the next step in their careers, will also be on hand to answer any questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There will also be an opportunity to attend a tour of the state-of-the-art, purpose built facilities at the Advanced Construction Skills Centre next door to the Skills Academy, which opened last September.  This £9m facility is where students studying construction courses with the City of Bristol College learn the skills they need for a future-proof career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Times are tough for lots of people in Bristol South, and I know many are worried about making ends meet as the Government continues to offer inadequate support.  Having a well-paid, secure job has become particularly important and one of the ways in which I am supporting my constituents is through my Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“An apprenticeship is a really valuable way of learning new skills and gaining experience in your chosen career whilst also being paid for your work.  They can bring huge benefits to individuals in broadening career options and building knowledge, but also to help businesses develop a workforce with the skills needed for the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“An apprenticeship is suitable for adults of any age and stage of career, with options across a wide range of sectors, so I’d encourage anyone who is looking to change careers, upskill in their current role or who are entering the first stages of their career to come along to the South Bristol Skills Academy to find out more about the different courses and jobs available in the local area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last night in the House of Commons, South Lakes MP Tim Farron to end the ongoing scandal of sewage being dumped into England's lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Tim's bill would ban water companies from dumping sewage into rivers and legislate to name and shame the companies found to poison animals.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, water companies would be forced to publish quarterly figures of how many animals have been forced to swim in sewage polluted rivers.</p>
<p>It comes as new figures from the Rivers Trust found that water companies dumped sewage more than 2,800 times in South Lakeland last year for a duration of 36,265 hours.</p>
<p>This included:</p>
<p>- 1172 hours at Staveley wastewater treatment works into the River Kent</p>
<p>- 1348 hours at Grasmere wastewater treatment works into Grasmere Lake</p>
<p>- 1372 hours at Hawkshead wastewater treatment works into Black Beck</p>
<p>- 1809 hours at Milnthorpe sewage treatment plant into the River Bela</p>
<p>- 2710 hours at Coniston wastewater treatment works into Church Beck</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"The bill would require water companies to produce accurate and comprehensive quarterly reports on the impact of sewage discharges on animal welfare, human health and the environment.</em></p>
<p><em>"The public have a right to know what our water companies are being allowed to do.</em></p>
<p><em>"With the cleansing impact of public scrutiny, and the literally cleansing effect of water companies spending their money on upgrades rather than bonuses, hopefully the public will soon see encouraging signs to give them faith in our waterways and renewed faith in our political system that the polluters will actually be held to account for dumping sewage into our lakes and rivers, that they will no longer be permitted to do so, no matter how powerful they may be, and that companies making billions in profit will no longer be protected by a Conservative Government who permitted them to discharge sewage 772,000 times in two years.</em></p>
<p><em>"What, then, shall we protect: the inflated profits of water companies, or the safety and beauty of our lakes and rivers? It is time for all of us in this House to take action and to pick a side."</em></p>

&lt;p class="hs_Para"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many Newcastle upon Tyne Central residents have contacted me to share precious moments missed, and have charged me with holding the Prime Minister to account. They do not accept his apology, because they thought long and hard about the difficult decisions they had to make, weighing up the huge personal cost against the terrible consequences of spreading the virus. They made the right decision. The Prime Minister did not, apparently because he is too stupid to understand his own regulations. If he is so much stupider than my constituents, why—how—can he claim to lead them and the nation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps paid a special visit to the now Old Hatfield-based Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce, opening its new office, and hearing the organisation’s plans for supporting local businesses.</strong></p>



<p>Local MP Grant Shapps paid a special visit to the now Salisbury Square-based Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce, opening its new modernistic office.</p>



<p>During Mr Shapps’ visit, Chamber chief executive Briege Leahy promoted the organisation’s “leading” role in guiding its member’s post-pandemic recovery.</p>



<p>The pair thrashed out the need to support young people economically across Welwyn Hatfield and Hertfordshire, focusing on how the Chamber could help turn younger entrepreneurs’ ideas into reality.</p>



<p>Moving on, the duo touched on issues such as east-west public transport routes across Hertfordshire, and redevelopment plans in Welwyn Hatfield- including the opportunities for businesses arising from them.</p>



<p>The two then discussed Welwyn Hatfield’s leading role in the deployment of electric vehicle infrastructure, with Mr Shapps emphasising the constituency’s high number of charging points.</p>



<p>Of the meeting Mr Shapps said, “it was great to come and open a new chapter in the Chamber’s long history of service to local businesses.</p>



<p>“It’s assuring to know that Briege and her team are working hard to support businesses of all sizes across Hertfordshire, particularly those in my own Welwyn Hatfield constituency.</p>



<p>“I know that the Chamber will be able to expand upon its excellent work from the new premises here in Old Hatfield.”</p>



<p>Miss Leahy added to Mr Shapps’ comments saying, “we enjoyed giving Grant a tour of our new office and grasped the opportunity to tell him all about our work, as well as discussing some of the challenges faced by businesses based in Hertfordshire.</p>



<p>“Our programme of activities is dedicated to overcoming obstacles and addressing the opportunities raised by the Secretary of State, assisting the Chamber’s more than 800 members in their pursuit of operating profitable businesses.”</p>



<p>To top off a successful meeting Mr Shapps presented Miss Leahy with an award on behalf of the High Sheriff of Hertfordshire, Lionel Wallace, whom he met with the same day.</p>



<p>The Chamber of Commerce has been guiding businesses across Welwyn Hatfield and Hertfordshire since 1924.</p>



<p>It provides support for businesses of all shapes and sizes, both local and national, through its membership benefits and networking opportunities.</p>



<p>The Chamber recently moved from its previous premises in the MacLaurin Building, Hatfield Business Park, to its new office in York House, Old Hatfield.</p>

    <title>We must break our dependence on hostile foreign governments</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/we-must-break-our-dependence-on-hostile-foreign-governments/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Households across the country are reeling from the monumental April energy price cap rise. As of April. the average family must now find an extra £700 per year to cover rocketing energy costs, a crippling rise which the Bank of England say is the single biggest shock since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to that increasing fuel and food costs, and the Chancellor’s hike to National Insurance, the bottom line is that even more families are going to have to choose between heating their homes or eating, all when energy companies are posting record profits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces are attacking peaceful Ukrainian villages, towns and cities with missiles and bombs which are killing innocent civilians, including children. As I said to the Prime Minister during recent questions, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Putin continues to appal most of the world and shames the rest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while Britain plays its part in supporting Ukraine against Putin’s invasion, the situation has also shed a stark light on our economic reliance on energy and investment from hostile foreign governments. It is a dependence we need to break.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a Member of Parliament, my first duty is to ensure the safety and security of our nation and its people. Ensuring that we have proper control of our own energy and infrastructure – the very things we need to keep our country running – is a fundamental issue of national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I called on the Prime Minister to double our production targets for domestically produced hydrogen to reduce our dependence on foreign fossil fuels and improve our energy resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister agreed with me when he said “that’s exactly what we should be doing”. However, these words must be followed by government action to ensure our energy infrastructure and so much more is secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, I have presented my bill to Parliament to tackle the anti-social use of quads by giving police the powers they need to be able to track, seize and destroy illegally used quads, and to make wearing of helmets a legal requirement. I will be meeting with ministers in the coming weeks as I continue to push the government to change the law. I have also called for a wider debate to properly discuss the issue. As we move into summer, nuisance quads will become more of a problem as the days get longer and the weather improves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will also be our first summer in several years where we can properly enjoy outdoor festivals and concerts. These events were a growing industry before the pandemic and will doubtless be hugely popular now restrictions have ended. However, I am deeply concerned by the sheer scale of under reported spiking at these events and the lack of focus on tackling these terrible crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More disturbingly, the support offered to victims of spiking, who are predominately women and young girls, is often inadequate. Medical tents focus on life-saving care and offer no continuity of care or proper safeguarding, while security services are, frankly, often there to protect the venue, and not the festival-goers. On top of that, police recording of incidents at these events is patchy, with no central collection of crimes as part of official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combine this with the fact that those under 18 are allowed to attend often overnight without adult supervision, in a place where they lack their usual support networks, creates a huge safeguarding blind spot that leaves them vulnerable to predatory behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This needs to change. I am working with West Yorkshire Police, government and other agencies to find a solution to further protect young people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe an intervention is needed that requires festivals to have a robust safeguarding plan in place to deal with spiking and sexual assault before they are granted a license. There needs to be better security on these sites and improved staff training to recognise the signs of spiking, as well as specialist medical and support services that means young girls and women can receive continuing care. We also need effective national recording and tougher sentences for these vile crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is great news that Bradford has made it to the final four in the competition to be the UK’s City of Culture 2025. It is a spectacular opportunity to showcase the many brilliant, cultural exports that we know makes Bradford the ideal candidate to win this competition. I have always been outspoken in my belief that sport is one of Bradford’s greatest cultural assets, including the legendary Bradford Bulls in my own constituency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m working with Bradford Council, the Bradford Bulls and others to pull together a levelling-up bid to Government that will put sport and Odsal at the heart of Bradford South’s regeneration plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What better way would there be to celebrate the sporting and cultural potential of Bradford than to become the UKs City of Culture in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Recess Round-Up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/recess-round-up/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Monday 14th March, I attended the launch of the Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Strategy call for evidence, which will inform the development of the UK Government’s ABI Strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An ABI is defined as a non-degenerative injury occurring to the brain since birth, and includes traumatic and non-traumatic. There are many causes: road traffic accidents, assaults, falls, strokes, infectious diseases, hypoxia, metabolic disorders, and toxins. Our ambition is to prevent brain injuries wherever possible and change the care and support to those with an ABI, so they have the chance of the fullest quality of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the launch we heard very emotional evidence from suffers of an ABI. Chris Bryant is chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for ABI, and I’m the vice-chair. Chris had a Private Members’ Bill (PMB) on ABI which received its Second Reading on 3rd December 2021, and proposed that the UK Government prepare and publish to meet the needs of children and adults with an ABI. There are over 1.3 million deaths costing £15 billion to the UK economy every year and is cross departmental, affecting Health and Social Care, Work and Pensions, Education, DCMS, Ministry of Justice, and Housing, Communities, and Local Government. Chris gained cross-party and Government support for his PMB propositions. UK Government committed to publishing a strategy, and set up a Call for Evidence overseen by Chris and Minister of State for Care and Mental Health, Gillian Keegan MP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/acquired-brain-injury-call-for-evidence">Call for Evidence</a> will be open for 12 weeks, and anyone over 16, and stakeholders, can respond. Link to Call for Evidence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monday’s business in the Chamber started with a debate on Lords Amendments to the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill. At 6:14pm we voted on Lords amendment 1, which would have tilted the balance back towards Parliament by giving the House of Commons a vote on a dissolution of Parliament, because the Bill as drafted gives the Government power to decide, losing by 217-292 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next debate concerned the Professional Qualifications Bill, which the UK Government had introduced in the Lords. When the Bill was going through the Lords and at Committee stage Labour argued, without success, that UK Government should be required to consult with the Devolved Administrations before making regulations. However, UK Government has inserted New Clause 1 into the Bill which is on point, and on its return to the Commons, we supported this. We also voted on amendment 3, which would give Scottish and Welsh Governments power to revoke or amend measures in the Bill, at 7.07pm, losing by 210-296 votes. We abstained on the Bill’s Third Reading at 7.26pm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next debate was on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-14/debates/AFFC9F8D-F3B7-4DD7-877B-F36620B67362/AnimalWelfare(Sentience)Bill(Lords)">Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill</a>, which the UK Government again introduced in the Lords. We voted on Labour Front Bench New Clause 1, which would place a duty on the Secretary of State to produce an animal sentience strategy and provide an update to Parliament, at 9.27pm, losing by 179-286 votes. We then voted on Deidre Brock’s, SNP Opposition, New Clause 3, which we supported because it would require the Animal Sentience Committee to produce a report on the adverse effects of the UK Government’s welfare of animals policy on experimentation on animals, at 9.42pm losing by 218-288 votes. We supported New Clause 5, tabled by Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat Opposition, which would require the Animal Sentience Committee to produce a report on the impact of polluted rivers on sentient animals, at 9.56pm but lost the division 179-286.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Early Tuesday morning, as vice-chair of the APPG for Steel and Metal-Related Industries, I joined officers of the APPG and representatives from UK Steel, and for a virtual meeting with Lee Rowley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at BEIS. The Minister for Industry set out the UK Government’s overall vision, strategy and plan for strengthening the British steel industry, followed by answering some questions posed by the APPG officers. The Minister spoke of the need to support the steel sector and of the importance placed on our sector by the PM and the Business Secretary. We pressed him on the timeline for action on industrial electricity prices, which he didn’t have any details, but assured us it was a priority of the UK Government. Later that day, the UK Government announced a 35% tariff on iron and steel imports from Russia and Belarus, following similar announcements by the EU last week. The 35% tariff is on top of existing tariffs, including anti-dumping duties and safeguards, and imposes a ban on high-end luxury goods exports to Russia. The EU, however, has imposed a complete ban on finished steel products. UK Steel raised concerns that Russian producers would have strong incentive to export at any cost and undercut the UK market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the meeting had concluded, we went to <a href="https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/1503786449312825347">College Green to meet with steelworkers</a>, their families, and trade unions representatives from South Wales and Yorkshire, to listen to their concerns and join in their protest against UK Government inaction on high energy costs that threaten the future of the UK steel sector. The UK Government must acknowledge the importance of steel as a source of jobs, growth, and community. Steelworkers and trade unions were hoping that the UK Government would announce support for the steel sector in the Spring Statement which was scheduled to take place the following week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, as vice-chair of the APPG on the UKSPF, I joined officers of the APPG plus Professor Steve Fothergill, Secretariat of the APPG, for a virtual meeting with Neil O’Brien, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. We challenged the Minister on his Government’s promise that the UKSPF will work up to an average of £1.5bn, (broadly the same as EU funding after allowing for inflation), by 2024-25, because actual spending on projects always lags behind financial commitments, unless it is possible to commit to £1.5bn a year in each of the next financial years, it is unavoidable that after 2024-25 UKSPF spending will once more fall below this threshold. Therefore, we asked the Minister if funding could be cranked-up in the first 12 months. EU funding was based on a 7 year cycle, so long-term transformative projects were possible, so we asked whether UKSPF could be based on a 7 year cycle. The APPG has been calling for funding to be based on a formula rather than a competitive bidding process, and we are pleased that the UK Government has agreed, but the formula needs to be skewed towards the least prosperous parts of the UK in line with levelling up and to replicate EU funding. I asked the Minister what role the Welsh Labour Government will have in the development and delivery of UKSPF local investment plans, because it had been mooted that Welsh Government would be by-passed in favour of direct delivery by local authorities. The Minister assured me that he wants strong input from the Welsh Government on where the money is spent and on what it is spent on in Wales. The APPG would expect this to be reflected in the amounts of UKSPF allocated to Wales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, I attended the virtual confidential meeting of the Western Gateway APPG, co-chaired by Jess Morden MP (Newport East), with guest speaker Jane Mudd, Leader of Newport City Council, to listen to progress made on the Independent Economic Review, the Digital Accelerator Proposal, and the Nuclear Fusion STEP Project. The working group is developing a unique proposition responding to the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) call for a STEP fusion prototype power plant, which could provide opportunities across the entire Western Gateway geography and beyond. Katherine Bennett, Chair of the Western Gateway, said that the working group is on target to meet the submission deadline of 31st March.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Petitions Committee had asked me to open the debate on banning greyhound racing in the UK, and in advance of the debate scheduled for 28th March, I met virtually with the Petitioner who wants to remain anonymous, because of the social media attacks that he/she has suffered since creating the petition in October 2020. The Petitioner impressed on me that greyhound racing causes hundreds of greyhound injuries, deaths, being put to sleep for humane and economic reasons, surplus greyhounds due to overbreeding and those discarded because they were not fast enough, in a sector that is driven by online betting. The Petitioner has serious concerns about animal welfare issues at tracks and kennels at registered and independent tracks in the UK. And there are no vets present at tracks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I chaired <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-16/debates/08D39864-61BB-4567-9019-6A782B5B57B5/In-WorkPoverty#contribution-0FEF020B-E5B0-4457-95F7-2E24D05561CE">debates in Westminster Hall</a>. The first debate was considering In-work Poverty moved by Grahame Morris Labour MP (Easington), and quoted Nelson Mandela “poverty…is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings…Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right to dignity and a decent life…While poverty persists, there is no true freedom.” Mr Morris said that poverty is a Conservative political choice, which this UK Government should be ashamed of. Many MPs from different Parties made contributions to a very lively debate, and David Rutledge MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, responded on behalf of the UK Government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second debate was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-16/debates/7F416143-9BDE-45D0-B18E-BA16CD2EFE7C/FutureOfSoftPower#contribution-539CC3B9-595A-4526-B29D-9ADC9DF15907">Future of Soft Power</a>, moved by John Baron, Conservative MP for Basildon and Billericay, chair of the British Council APPG. Mr Baron said that democracy is a fragile concept which needs nurturing, encouraging and protecting. And in this new Cold War, we need to talk softly and carry a big stick, because soft power was a key factor in victory in the Cold War. The British Council had been in touch with more than 750 million people worldwide for education, arts, and the English language. Mr Baron asked the UK Government to provide notice of full allocation of funding for the British Council for the spending review period; no further cuts which result in country closures; and to stop touting a 26% increase in funding, because the British Council lost £10 million commercial revenue during the pandemic year, closing in 20 countries. The Minister for Asia and the Middle East, Amanda Milling MP, responded for the UK Government and said that since the start of the pandemic her Government had allocated £560 million to support the British Council, including £180 million in grant aid for 21-22, an increase of £40 million from last year, a generous deal in the current financial climate, which Mr Baron said did not answer his questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last debate was about <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-16/debates/14F3F317-4917-4E73-9DF1-086C5C26148A/LocalEnterprisePartnerships#contribution-B42AD62B-1274-4DF5-AC99-200608D739DE">Local Enterprise Partnerships</a> (LEPs), moved by Sally-Ann Hart, Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye. Ms Hart extolled the benefits of LEPs to local economies – more than 2,000 local business leaders give their time and expertise, which encourages a culture of enterprise and engagement. LEPs broker investment that deliver jobs, environment, and local taxes that local communities need and depend on, but the UK Government LEP review has left the sector in limbo, many talented people have left LEPs, and business leaders are impacted. She asked that LEPs have funding to ensure they play a significant part in Levelling Up. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Neil O’Brien MP, responded for the UK Government, and reassured Ms Hart that the White Paper has made sure LEPs have a future and how they fit with Mayoral authorities, and will be funded appropriately. He spoke about LEPs delivering £12 billion local growth fund and £900 million Getting Better fund, plus examples of successful LEP projects throughout England.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning I chaired the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-17/debates/9357f561-3280-4d6a-9e8f-9bea07bfbd1e/DraftFoodAndFeedSafety(MiscellaneousAmendmentsAndTransitionalProvisions)Regulations2022">Fifth Delegated Legislation Committee</a> for The Food and Feed Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2022. Edward Argar MP, Minster of State for Health and Social Care, moved the motion whose purpose is to amend a deficiency in Article 53 of the retained General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) to ensure that emergency measures that may be applied where a serious risk to health is identified and applied to all goods entering GB. And amend authorisation provisions for feed additives and GM food/feed so that decisions made by UK Government Ministers will be enacted through legislation making these consistent with other retained EU feed and food law. It will provide a time-limited period of adjustment to 30th September 2022 for businesses to meet new UK address labelling requirements for certain food products, which would allow businesses to use up old labelling stocks, without facing enforcement action for failure to label affected products with a UK address during this time. Shadow Minister Daniel Zeichner MP supported the regulations amendments, but sought clarification on certain aspects. The Minister provided answers, and the amendments were passed by the committee without a division.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon I chaired a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-17/debates/195CB781-62C5-4306-8564-D2B80933CA84/GenderSpecificReligiousPersecution#contribution-CA1FF210-1AFF-4EC5-81C6-37E8BFDA0D5F">General Debate on Specific Religious Persecution</a>, secured by Jim Shannon MP (Strangford – DUP). Mr Shannon stated that although violations of religion or belief can affect any member of a minority community, women and girls from communities suffering from persecution based on religion or belief face a double vulnerability of being at greater risk, and that these have a greater impact on their lives, than men, and gave some very graphic examples of the persecution of young girls. Several MPs contributed to the debate, and there was broad agreement as summed up by Sarah Owen, MP for Luton North, Shadow Spokesperson, that there is a moral duty to intervene in areas of gross violence, suppression and misogyny. The UK Government Minister for Europe and North America, James Cleverly MP, responded, and said that freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right but is denied to millions of people around the world, and that his Government is continuing to work with international partners on a range of measures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday evening I joined <a href="https://www.visitbanwen.org">Banwen’s virtual celebration of St Patrick’s Day</a>, with guest speaker, and a good friend of mine, Mick Antoniw, MS for Pontypridd and Counsel General for Welsh Labour Government, and long-term advocate for human rights, who spoke about the threat to the Rule of Law by the rise of populism and consequent breakdown of democracy throughout the world. Mick also spoke about Putin invading Ukraine, and that Putin wants to destroy Ukraine’s sovereignty. Just before the invasion, Mick had visited his family, who are still living in Ukraine. Another old friend of mine, Tony Lloyd, Labour MP Rochdale, officer of the Ireland and the Irish in Britain APPG who had secured a backbench debate in the Chamber that afternoon entitled “Irish Diaspora in Britain” to celebrate St Patrick’s Day, sent a supportive video message. Banwen claims to be the birthplace and home of Patrick before he became the Patron Saint of Ireland, and this was first put forward in a John Bull magazine in the 1950s, which stated that Patrick was “plucked like a stone from the bog at Bannavem Taberniae, translated as Tafarn y Banwen, a well known local place, and just a short distance from an Iron Age bog. Banwen’s famous local historian George Brinley Evans, now aged 96, and his close friend Tom Marston pioneered this story, and on St Patrick’s Day in 2004 they unveiled a stone at Tafarn y Banwen at an event attended by local schoolchildren and dignitaries to commemorate St Patrick. Last June, Richard Parry, an arts and culture development practitioner, and Roman history specialists Comitatus, were instrumental in organising a re-enactment of the kidnapping of Patrick and his sister Darrerca from Banwen, which included workshops in schools, and Banwen RFC members playing Irish Raider Pirates, who chased, and eventually caught, two children who were cast as Patrick and his sister, as they tried to evade the pirates by running around Banwen. There will be more celebrations this summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Friday 18th March, Parliament was sitting for Private Members’ Bills (PMB), and because my PMB on Marcora Law was listed at number 37 in the Order Paper, there was no likelihood of it being debated. Therefore, my PMB has been re-listed for Friday 6th May 2022.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday 21st March, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, I attended an executive meeting of the Wales Co-operative Council to plan forthcoming events to be held in respect of the founder of the Co-operative Movement Robert Owen, who was born in Newtown Powys on 14th May 1771. He was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropist, and social reformer, founder of utopian socialism and the co-operative movement. His aim was to improve factory working conditions, and he promoted experimental socialist communities and sought a collective approach. Last year’s events were held online, but it is hoped that on 14th May 2022, we can hold some physical events in celebration of Robert Owen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday afternoon the UK Government granted Labour an Official Opposition Day Debate in which we considered P&amp;O Ferries and Employment Rights. We pushed the debate to a division after 6 hours of protected time, but as is becoming the custom of the UK Government, they once again instructed all Conservative MPs not to take part in a vote that we push to a division at the conclusion of our Opposition Day Debates. We won the vote 211-0, in which all opposition Parties joined us in the Yes Lobby, but once again, this victory is symbolic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, I pledged my support for a net-zero, nature positive future, for UK landscapes, where people and nature thrive alongside each other when I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1507401933945860099">World Wildlife Fund Earth Hour event in Parliament</a>. The rise in global environmental movement in recent years has shown how many people care about our planet. On 26th March at 8.30pm lights around the world would be switched off for an hour in solidarity so people could come together to look after one another and our shared home, at the 15th Anniversary of Earth Hour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then I joined the virtual launch meeting of Unite’s “<a href="https://www.unitetheunion.org/campaigns/get-me-home-safely-campaign/">Get Me Home Safely</a>” campaign. We heard from speakers within Unite, organisations supporting the campaign, and former MP Tracy Brabin, now Mayor of West Yorkshire. The purpose of the campaign is to make sure that night shift workers get home safely, because experiences of sexual assault, harassment, violence and stalking are common occurrences on streets and on public transport. Workers have a right to access safe transport at all hours of the day, but many find this difficult after a late shift. Unite representatives said that delayed and insufficient UK Government support for taxi drivers during the pandemic has caused shortages, and in the bus sector, decades of privatisation, legislative failure, a commercialised and unregulated systems have caused cuts to services, increased fares, and a deficit of 4,000 drivers. The campaign seeks to organise workers from across the sectors and committees of Unite to take ownership of the safety and wellbeing of workers by extending their duty of care to implement safe transport home principles for night shift workers, which would include: free transport home as a prerequisite for late night venue licences; risk assessments for individual worker’s journey times and potential hazards after leaving work; lobbying the UK Government to ratify ILO Convention 190 to end harassment and violence in the workplace; trained staff, enforcement, and reporting of sexual harassment and violence on public transport; clear and operational CCTV on all public transport; municipal ownership of buses; national minimum standards for taxi and private hire vehicles and an end to cross border hiring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon I attended our weekly Petitions Committee meeting to discuss the petitions delivered in Westminster Hall during our regular weekly Monday night slots, and to receive information from the clerks to the committee about petitions that have reached the threshold of signatures and will be debated in the future, including Government responses to petitions that have recently been received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a member of the APPG for Mutuals, which has over 100 members from both Houses, I attended its AGM and programme of work meeting for an update on our campaign to prevent LV= being taken over by a private equity firm. I was re-elected as treasurer of the APPG. The APPG was disappointed it had to conduct an inquiry into the planned demutualisation of LV=, but members believe we have acted in the public interest, because the company’s leadership had not presented a strong case for the takeover. Our inquiry collected evidence and conducted interviews with the key people involved with the takeover, and found that every demutualisation over the past 35 years has been driven by the board, not the members, so there’s an imbalance which must be addressed. Demutualisation is bad for members, consumer competition, choice and financial market stability. Customers need mutuals. The sequence of events at LV=, when the company converted from a friendly society and was put up for sale 12 months later, requires scrutiny, and our inquiry has added to information that LV= members can draw from. Read the report <a href="http://appgmutuals.coop/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/APPG-Mutuals-LV-report-April-2021.pdf">here</a>. We heard from Martin Shaw, Chief Executive of the Association of Financial Mutuals, who updated us on the lessons learned and the actions needed, following the attempted demutualisation of LV=.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The division bells sounded at 4.15pm calling MPs to vote, so we drew the meeting to a close and dashed off to the voting lobbies. Votes started at 4.19pm with the UK Government voting to disagree with Lords Amendments 4,5,6,7, to the Nationality and Borders Bill, whilst Labour voted to support all these amendments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 4 was cross-bench, signed by the Labour Front Bench, to delete clause 9 which extended the Secretary of State’s powers in relation to deprivation of citizenship “without notice”. Lord Anderson added some safeguards which the UK Government accepted. We lost by 318-223 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 5 added a new clause which stated that nothing in the Bill authorises policies or decisions which do not comply with the Refugee Convention. We lost by 313-231 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 6 was cross-bench signed by the Labour Front Bench to remove clause 12 which introduced different treatment of refugees by placing them in two different groups. Group 1 would be people who have come to the UK directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened and have presented to authorities without delay. Group 2 would be those who have travelled through a safe third country where they could have reasonably expected to have claimed asylum. We lost by 318 to 220 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amendment 7 was a Tory backbench amendment supported by Labour and cross-benchers, and provided asylum seekers with a right to work if they are still awaiting a decision after 6 months. The Home Office’s own figures show there are 61,864 applications pending an initial decision after waiting for 6 months. We lost by 291-232 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My week ended with a visit to <a href="https://www.hoperescue.org.uk">Hope Rescue Centre</a>, near Llanharan as part of my research ahead of presenting E-Petition 554073, which is asking the UK Government to introduce legislation to abolish greyhound racing by a managed shutdown of activities, and to ensure the welfare of dogs. I met Vanessa Waddon, who sold her house to set up Hope Rescue after a greyhound called Last Hope was discovered abandoned on Caerphilly mountain in 2004, having been shot with a captive bolt gun, and his ears hacked off to hide identifying tattoos. When Last Hope was found, he was alive, but had to be put to sleep due to the severity of his injuries. I also met Alain Thomas from Greyhound Rescue Wales and a volunteer called Malcolm who had adopted Hector, a lovely greyhound who had been rescued from a racing track after breaking his left front leg trying to negotiate the very sharp first bend of the track.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday 28th March, I attended the AGM of the Alternative Dispute Resolution APPG, and was re-elected vice-chair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday evening, I opened the debate on E-Petition 554073, which asks the UK Government to abolish greyhound racing through a managed shutdown and ensure the welfare of redundant greyhounds by a levy on the industry. The petition closed on 30th April 2021 with 104,885 signatures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, the Petitioner wanted to remain anonymous because of attacks via social media, so it was my responsibility to present their words to the MPs who attended the Westminster Hall debate. The debate was well attended, with MPs presenting contrary views. The Petitioner, Vanessa Waddon, supporters and a rescued greyhound Suzy were in the public gallery listening to the debate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Petitioner believes that the welfare of racing greyhounds is not adequately protected by animal welfare legislation, the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB), independent bodies, and that greyhounds endure suffering on dangerously configured tracks, are raced in extreme weather, and housed in kennels not independently inspected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following pressure from welfare charities and campaigners, GBGB have been required to publish annual data of racing greyhounds since 2017, but Dogs Trust and the RSPCA have questioned the accuracy of this data, and it is not broken down to track level, so does not flag remedial action if needed at a specific track.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the data is very concerning. Between 2017 and 2019, a total of 14,770 were injured, and 1643 were put to sleep for humane or economic reasons. The Petitioner discovered that greyhounds recorded as being in rescue centres, or re-homed as a pet, were still racing. Greyhounds recorded as retired are sometimes sold or given away to race on the 3 Independent tracks in the UK. Therefore, the dual system of registered GBGB and Independent tracks, does not work because greyhounds are being interchanged between the two separate systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My speech included details that Vanessa had told me when I visited Hope Rescue. Vanessa supports the UK campaign and in September 2021, Hope Rescue launched the Senedd Petition to ban greyhound racing in Wales, which received 35,101 signatures, and was discussed by the Senedd Petitions Committee on 7th March. The committee agreed a “call for evidence” followed by a debate in the Senedd. Another example of the Welsh Parliament leading the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vanessa told me that she set up the “Amazing Greys” project at the Independent Valleys Track at Ystrad Mynach in April 2018, so that Hope Rescue could provide emergency rescue places for injured and surplus greyhounds before transferring them to Dogs Trust, Greyhound Rescue Wales, or Forever Hounds Trust. Between April 2018 and August 2021, the project took 200 greyhounds whose owners or trainers had links with Valleys Track. 40 had serious injuries and 5 didn’t survive. Many had old undiagnosed injuries, lameness, skin and dental problems, fleas, worms, and suffered with anxiety and fear. 67% of the injured greyhounds were GBGB greyhounds, reinforcing the Petitioner’s assertion that there is no division between GBGB and Independent tracks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The majority of injuries were broken legs, snapped bones going through the skin. Valleys Track boasts its “eye-watering sharp first bend” on its website. Dr Andrew Knight’s “Injuries in Racing Greyhounds” report 2018, explains that because races are run anti-clockwise, most injuries occur on the left foreleg and the right hind leg, when negotiating a bend the left foreleg is used as a pivot, claws digging into the track, and the right hind leg moves in an arc providing the propulsive force, causing maximum stress. The bones become spongy, and honeycombed. Vanessa and her volunteers were heartbroken when they took the injured greyhounds to Hope Rescue vets, and witnessed their immense suffering. There were no vets at Valleys Track. After publicly sharing the E-Petition, Vanessa was told that Hope Rescue was not welcome at Valleys Track, so the current fate of the injured and surplus greyhounds is no longer known.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Public attitudes to greyhound racing are changing. There were once 77 GBGB tracks and 200 Independent tracks in the UK, but now only 20 and 3 remain. 99% of UK bets on greyhound racing are placed online, so this doesn’t benefit the local economy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hope Rescue commissioned a YouGov Poll which showed that 45% of the public support a ban, 17% do not, and 38% are unsure, or don’t support either option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andrew Rosindell MP Romford, and Ian Lavery MP Wansbeck spoke in favour of greyhound racing and believed that GBGB are serious about improving welfare regulations. Neil Parish MP Tiverton and Hinton, chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee spoke about the report on greyhound racing that his committee produced in 2006, and said that UK Government and the industry should take the petition seriously, and use it as a very positive approach to ensure that welfare of greyhounds is improved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>John McNally MP Falkirk, SNP spokesperson, spoke in support of the petition. Ruth Jones MP Newport West, Opposition spokesperson, stated that the Labour Party do not support a ban, but greyhound racing should have the safeguards and protections it needs: proper guidance on best practice in responsible ownership; statutory minimum standards for racing and welfare; better methods to trace ownership; and a centralised database to record retired greyhounds. Ruth asked the Minister to get on with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Petitioner and Vanessa believe that a ban is the only solution. This can be achieved immediately in Scotland and Wales, who have very few tracks (Valleys Track is the only track in Wales), but in England a ban should be phased-in to ensure that displaced greyhounds can be accommodated, and infrastructure dismantled over time. I asked the Minister if she would meet with the Petitioner, Vanessa and myself, and have followed up with a letter to Jo Churchill MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Agri-innovation and Climate Adaptation, whose brief covers animal welfare. Read the full debate <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-28/debates/3D4F5F47-3466-44ED-B67D-C8A7AC0ACC7C/GreyhoundRacing">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Monday 28<sup>th</sup>, the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-28/debates/7CBF7AD7-B30C-4C50-99BA-DFC38EA79539/PoliceCrimeSentencingAndCourtsBill">Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill</a> returned from the Lords, and at 7.56pm we started voting on Lords Amendments. We supported Lords Amendment 72B, and proposed amendments (a) and (b), and lost the division by 283-148 votes. This would have mandated the police recording of crimes that effectively amount to hostility on grounds of sex or gender, and introduced a stand-alone offence related to harassment or intimidation aggravated by hostility towards sex or gender. We supported Lords Reason 73, and Amendments 74B-74G, and Reason 87G, and lost by 276-202 votes. 73 and 87G would have removed provisions relating to noisy protests regarding making it easier for police to impose conditions on marches and static protests, including powers to impose conditions on a protest public assembly or public procession as “too noisy”. The Government added amendment 74 inserting a definition of “serious disruption”. Amendment 87 would remove the ability of the police to impose conditions on one-person protests. And finally, at 8.23pm we voted in support of Lords Amendment 80G which would have removed increased powers regarding public assembly, and lost by 278-202 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, I attended the Pension Clawback APPG and was re-elected vice-chair.</p>
<p>The APPG was set up to campaign for HSBC to remove state deduction (clawback) from the post 1974 Midland Bank Defined Benefit Pension Scheme, and highlight its discriminatory impacts. Over 51,000 HSBC pensioners are subject to indirect discrimination in one of its 23 pension schemes, but almost no one knew of its existence. The campaign group has repeatedly been refused its requests to meet with HSBC to discuss the removal of clawback. HSBC has recently commissioned a market review of the state deduction in the third quarter of 2020, which demonstrated that integration of private pensions and state benefits to target the overall level of benefit remains an accepted and common aspect of UK pensions practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was followed by chairing the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology officers’ meeting to plan the work programme for the next Parliamentary session. We decided to continue to focus on our campaign to urge the UK Government to amend the Hair Act 1968 to include mandatory registration for any person who wants to practice in the hair sector. The Hair Council has sole authority under the act, and Keith Conniford, the CEO and Registrar of the Hair Council, has been leading the campaign for mandatory registration for many years, and working with the APPG.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I visited a drop-in event to launch Amnesty UK’s Football Welcomes month, with the Afghan Women and Girls Development Football Team. The team and their families fled to Pakistan after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021. The team members successfully appealed to the UK Government to bring them to the UK and the squad are in temporary accommodation in North of England, but are training again. We heard from Khalida Popal, former captain of the Afghanistan team who helped get them out of Afghanistan. The Taliban had prohibited them from playing football. Amnesty International’s Football Welcomes programme celebrates the contribution players with a refugee background make to football and highlights the role of football in creating more welcoming communities for refugees and asylum seekers. On the morning of the event, the Afghan Team had played a match against the UK Women’s Parliamentary Football Club.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, as vice-chair of the Parkinson’s APPG I attended an event held ahead of World Parkinson’s Day, which is on 11th April. There are approximately 145,000 people living with Parkinson’s in the UK, and this is expected to grow by a fifth by 2030. I met with people with Parkinson’s and carers from across the UK to show my support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I chaired debates in Westminster Hall for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At 2.30pm Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, moved the motion <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-29/debates/22032976000001/Gambling-RelatedHarm#contribution-64B680CB-9DB3-45FF-8C17-531DFAB35B0E">that this House has considered gambling-related harm</a>. Ms Harris said that after over two years of debate, reports and evidence sessions and years of harm, addiction and ultimately loss of life, the White Paper is very imminent. And that she and colleagues across the House had faced the onslaught from the gambling industry. Ms Harris quoted many figures from many sources, for example: the charity GambleAware estimated that 1.4 million people suffer gambling related harms; the House of Lords Select Committee on the Gambling Industry found that 60% of gambling profits came from the 5% of people experiencing gambling harm; and she called for improvements to be included in the White Paper. For example: an independent affordability assessment with a soft affordability cap where an open banking check would kick in at £100 a month on net deposits because the average level of disposable income in Britain is £450; that Ministers work with the banking industry to ensure that all banks provide a comprehensive gambling blocking facility; a statutory levy of 1% would provide £130 million for treatment and research; stake limits for online gambling; a gambling ombudsman. She said that the whistle-to-whistle ban is not worth the paper it’s written on, she would not support anything Bet365 has done, and gambling companies spent more than £1.5 billion a year on advertising. Ms Harris welcomed the reforms introduced by the Gambling Commission such as, identity and age verification, banning credit cards, and customers having information on winnings and losses. But she stated there is more to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The debate was well attended and there were some lively interactions from MPs on either side of a very emotive subject. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nigel Huddleston MP, responded for the UK Government. He said that it was 17 years since the Gambling Act 2005 was passed and a review and reform is needed, but he was not able to announce what will be in the White Paper, which will be published in a few weeks. He said that the White paper would set out conclusions of the UK Government’s call for evidence regarding a statutory levy, advertising and sponsorship, gambling black market, and gambling premises licences.</p>
<p>Carolyn Harris MP wound up the debate by saying that she congratulated Bet365 for mobilising speakers and she hoped that its protection of vulnerable customers is as tenacious as its ability to get MPs to come and speak on its behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second debate was about <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-29/debates/3E181745-9543-4058-B54E-E9B6D9FDD0C8/Smoke-FreeEngland#contribution-7FC41681-99C1-45C1-9598-7ECF6F6E4B95">progress towards a smoke-free England</a> secured by Sir Charles Walker, MP for Broxbourne, and he quoted from the UK Government’s “Towards a smoke-free generation”, July 2017, which stated that over 200 deaths are caused every day through smoking, smoking rates are three times higher amongst the lower earners compared with highest earners, accounts for half the difference in life expectancy between richest and poorest, and its vision is a smoke-free generation. But Sir Charles asked what this would look like in 2030, and said that it would be 5% or less of the adult population smoking, according to the Lancet. Currently more than 14% of the adult population smokes averaging £10 per pack, and it could be higher because of lockdown. Cancer Research UK thinks it will be 2037, but Sir Charles thinks 2037 is optimistic. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maggie Throup MP, responded for the UK Government and stated that her records state 13.5% of UK adults smoke, but it’s too high, and there is more to do. She said that the UK Government will publish a new tobacco control plan later this year, which will set out a comprehensive package of new policy proposals and regulatory change, following a review led by Javid Khan, former CEO of Bernardo’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last debate was moved by Dr Kieran Mullen, <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-29/debates/54738924-93F9-45B9-ADCF-252B1532C2A9/GreatBritishRailwaysHeadquartersCreweBid">that this House has considered Crewe’s bid for the headquarters of Great British Railways</a>, and said that Crewe is at the heart of rail industry, and has 360 degree connectivity. Crewe was born from the railways when in 1837, the Grand Junction Railway Company placed a station in Crewe that connected Liverpool with Manchester railways, and London and Birmingham railways, and now has 6 railway lines. More than 3 million people live within 45 minutes commute by road or rail, 12 major universities within an hour commute, and 3 international airports. There is cross-party support from 12 MPs, and Pete Waterman. And all MPs who spoke supported Crewe’s bid.  The Minister of State at the Department for Transport, Wendy Morton, responded for the UK Government and said that this was the fourth debate on bids for the GBR HQ that she’s attended in the past few weeks. She said that she’d recently found out that her dad was born in a railway cottage, railways are close to her heart, and mentioned the Williams-Shapps plan for rail. The competition for GBR HQ was launched on 5th February and closed on 16th March with 42 submissions from towns and cities outside London and across the UK against the 6 criteria: alignment to levelling up objectives; connected and easy to get to; opportunities for GBR; railway heritage and links to the network; value for money; and public support. The bids will be shortlisted and then put to a consultative public vote. There will also be regional divisions of GBR HQ organised in line with Network Rail’s “Putting Passengers First” programme, which reflects how passengers and freight move across the network today. Cities and regions across England will have greater influence over local ticketing, services and stations, stations in partnership with local and regional government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That evening Labour voted against the draft Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No 2) Regulations 2022, and lost by 268-195 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning I chaired Westminster Hall debates, beginning with a very important debate moved by Sir Iain Duncan Smith, <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-30/debates/D706ABB2-F478-4AE9-8F86-4CE0C13C5DBD/BritishAndOverseasJudgesHongKong#contribution-9017292E-F718-464D-8CCF-9530D09C4CA2">that this House has considered the role of British and overseas judges in Hong Kong</a>. Before we began the debate I quoted Erskine May “reflections on a judge’s character or motives cannot be made except on a substantive motion” which Sir Iain’s motion was not. Sir Iain said that the debate was meant to be a demand from across parties that the UK Government should intervene and that British judges now serving in Hong Kong courts should withdraw, because their presence lent legitimacy to a brutal, totalitarian regime that has been prosecuting in Hong Kong against the Sino-British agreement terms, and against people whose only crime has been to cry out for freedom. However, just before Sir Iain came to the debate, he discovered that the UK Government agreed and wish the judges to withdraw, and invited the Minister to intervene to clarify the announcement. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Affairs, Vicky Ford MP, stated that it was laid in a written ministerial statement the night previously, published that morning, read out the statement, confirming that it is no longer tenable for serving UK judges to participate on the Final Court of Appeal, and that Lord Reed and Lord Hodge had submitted their resignations to the Hong Kong authorities that day. All MPs agreed with this statement and Sir Iain summed up by saying that it is a remarkable day, as a result of continual campaigning, and for too long we felt we must accommodate totalitarian regimes that have no regard for human rights, the rule of law, and democracy. The action taken has sent a signal that freedom matters and he thanked the UK Government for having moved on this matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next debate was moved by Elliot Colburn MP and considered<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-30/debates/E2F1FAEF-890C-47E4-9216-6B665B6C8344/HealthcareCarshaltonAndWallington#contribution-F60CB8B0-F645-481E-B761-ADE014032205"> Health Care Outcomes in Carshalton and Wallington</a>, in which he raised issues concerning his constituency, including: cancer outcomes; increase in dementia; obesity and he bravely spoke about his battles with obesity; mental health; and appealed for progress on investment for his local hospital – St Helier. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maggie Throup MP, responded and confirmed that a new hospital for Epsom and St Hilier University Hospital NHS Trust was part of her UK Government’s plans to build 40 new hospitals by 2030.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The afternoon’s debate in the chamber concerned the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-30/debates/159B83EA-68DF-4A72-AFB7-189970DE9114/HealthAndCareBill">Lords Amendments of the Health and Care Bill</a>. We voted on a series of amendments starting with amendment 85 at 5.11pm, which we lost by 275-183 votes. This Amendment mandated a consultation about a scheme to regulate the prices and profits of tobacco manufacturers and importers, to use these funds raised by the scheme on anti-smoking measures. Then we voted for Government Amendment (a) in lieu of Lords Amendment 92, losing by 215-188 votes. This amendment allowed telemedical abortion services to be made permanent, followed by a division on Lords Amendment 29, losing by 249-167 votes. This amendment would require the UK Government to publish assessments every two years with current and future NHS workforce assessments and projections for 5, 10, and 20 years in future. Then we supported Lords Amendment 30, which we lost by 265-156 votes. This amendment would remove clause 40 which gave the Secretary of State significant and largely unchecked powers to intervene at any stage of a local service reconfiguration, with no minimum sets of information requirements on which to base a decision. Then we voted to support Lords Amendment 80, which would have removed the £86,000 cap on social care costs, losing by 247-150 votes. And finally, we voted at 8.57pm to support Lords Amendment 90, losing by 259-147 votes. This amendment required that the option of independent mediation is explored before resorting to legal action in disputes over palliative care of children between parents and doctors.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>As flagged on my website last week, I have been aware of local fuel shortages affecting parts of Norfolk over the last couple of weeks (particularly in and around Dereham) – and have highlighted the situation with Ministers and officials at the DfT and BEIS to establish what the root causes are and to ask that everything that can be done is done to alleviate the pressures currently being felt at the pumps.</p>

<p>Those conversations are very much ongoing and this morning I joined BBC Radio Norfolk’s Breakfast Show to discuss the situation in greater depth, including the hypocrisy of the eco-warriors causing chaos for local people, businesses and local services across our region.</p>

<p>360 were arrested last week (costing Essex Police alone c.£1 million)</p>

<p>I very much appreciate the considerable disruption this problem has caused for many of my constituents (especially those living in some of the more rural villages here in Mid Norfolk) and am informed that normal service will resume at the pumps quickly. In the meantime, I will continue to do all I can to speak up for my constituents to ensure that they are heard.</p>

    <title>Preet Kaur Gill MP Praises Lordswood Boys’ School ‘Good’ Ofsted Report </title>

            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, has praised Lordswood Boys’ School in Harborne as it has recently been rated as ‘Good’ by Ofsted. This follows changes that have been put in place by the school’s senior leadership over recent years. </p>
<p>In 2014, the school was rated ‘Inadequate’. However, following a dramatic transition and the hard work over several years of staff, including Head Teacher, Lee Williams, its latest Ofsted inspection report rated Lordswood Boys’ as ‘Good’.  </p>
<p>The report outlined that “pupils enjoy attending Lordswood Boys’ School and receive a good quality of education”. It also states that “All staff have a shared desire to improve the school and pupils understand that education can open up opportunities for them to become positive and productive members of society.” </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It is fantastic to see this incredible transformation. This Ofsted result is well-deserved following the work staff have put in to make this change a reality. It’s great to know that pupils attending Lordswood Boys’ will receive the best possible education and can be ambitious about what they want to achieve, knowing their teachers will support them. I would like to thank all the staff and teachers for putting in so much effort to make sure children in Edgbaston constituency receive the start in life they should be entitled to.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lee Williams, Headteacher at Lordswood Boys’ School said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We are delighted with the inspection outcome. The students and staff at Lordswood Boys' School are fully deserving of the praise and recognition within the report and it is our intention to continue our work in embedding and enhancing the educational opportunities. Lordswood Boys' School is now a school of choice; a school that the community can trust and rely on. I am immensely proud of our collective achievement.

<p>Big thank you to all who helped make the Ukrainian fundraiser at EJ’s Cafe, Bar &amp; Restaurant  a success on Saturday, but especially to Y5 pupils at Ysgol Pen Rhos who read out very moving poems they had written, Cor Curiad for beautiful singing, Paolo, Stella, Llanelli Multicultural Network  and Llanelli Rotary Club  who have collected nearly £14,000 in a month to help Ukrainian refugees…. Money they can get to where it is needed through their Rotary International network, &amp; many thanks to everyone who has contributed. </p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update on support for Ukraine and a number of local issues. If you are receiving one of these messages for the first time it is because you have contacted me recently. I have been sending them out regularly during the pandemic to provide what I hope is helpful information for constituents. If you do not want to receive these updates my apologies – please use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h2>Ukraine</h2>
<p>Firstly on the tragic situation in the Ukraine, following a meeting on Friday night, we have now formed a group locally to prepare for the arrival of Ukrainian refugees in the area. Some will be staying with their families, but there will be a need to provide homes or accommodation for those without local connections here.</p>
<p>The process is being co-ordinated by the local <strong>Refugee Network</strong>, together with a group of local churches, myself and one of the Borough Councillors.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to be a host for one of these people or for a family group will need to go through a formal vetting process. If you are interested, please do bear in mind that this is a commitment that could last for more than a few months. Clearly we hope people can return home soon, but there is no guarantee of this as you will know. So please only offer if you are willing for this to be a pretty long term thing.</p>
<p>In order to register, please go to the website of the charity <strong>Refugees at Home</strong>, which is doing the processing of offers for us. It is at <strong><a href="https://www.refugeesathome.org/host-application/">www.refugeesathome.org/host-application/</a></strong></p>
<p>You will then receive a call from one of the volunteers who are working for the charity to talk through and check your offer with you.</p>
<p>If you are registering, please could you also let the local refugee network team know so that we have an idea of how many are putting their names forward and so how many people we can help locally. The email is <strong><a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com">epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are an experienced <strong>social worker, GP or Occupational Therapist</strong> with experience of doing home visits and checks, the charity will need more volunteers to do this work. If you are willing to help, you can register to do this at <strong><a href="https://www.refugeesathome.org/hv-description/">www.refugeesathome.org/hv-description/</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally the local team are collecting details of people with teaching experience who can help any children who come to the area. In particular they are keen to find a former <strong>senior member of a teaching staff or head teacher</strong> who is willing to volunteer to lead a new team to do this.</p>
<p>If you are willing to offer to do either of these and you have the relevant experience, either current or before you retired, please contact <strong><a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com">epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
<p>They are also keen to hear from anyone else willing to train as a volunteer or indeed just to make a donation to support their work. In addition if you are local landlord interested in finding out about renting to a refugee family then please contact the network to find out more.</p>
<h2>Local Donation Centre Epsom</h2>
<p>A reminder that a local team has set up a collection centre for local donations in the old H&amp;M unit in the Ashley Centre. That’s the original unit near House of Fraser and not the double floored one which has closed recently. They have an organised plan to move donations out to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their biggest ask right now is for donations of medical supplies, and in particular things like bandages, as well as over the counter painkillers like Ibuprofen. If you have items that you do not need, or are willing to buy some and drop them off there I know that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>Details of the charity doing this and what it is collecting are at <strong><a href="http://www.surreystandswithukraine.org">www.surreystandswithukraine.org</a></strong></p>
<p>They are also asking for donations to help pay for fuel costs to get van loads of supplies to the Polish/Ukrainian border, and are able to take cash or card donations at the centre in Epsom as well as on their website.</p>
<h2>National Donations Appeal</h2>
<p>If you want to donate to the national appeal being organised by the <strong>Disasters Emergency Committee/Red Cross</strong>, the link to the appeal site is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dec.org.uk/">www.dec.org.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>Your donation is being match funded by the Government.</p>
<h2>Chalk Pit Epsom</h2>
<p>On separate issues, firstly many of you will be aware that the County has approved the retrospective application for the expanded use of the Chalk Pit in Epsom as a recycling centre. I am profoundly unhappy about the decision, but it has to be ratified by the Planning Inspectorate and I am seeking to get it blocked. The Committee considering the plan did so without key information and I am working with local residents to get its decision looked at again. If you live in the area, you will be getting more information about what we are planning to do.</p>
<h2>Flood Resilience Meetings</h2>
<p>For those of you who have been affected by the regular localised flooding in the Nork and Tattenhams area and in Worcester Park, Surrey County Council has agreed to host two property flood resilience events for affected residents. This will provide residents with the opportunity to talk with flood experts and visit the floodmobile trailer to better understand what options are available to them and improve their resilience to flooding.</p>
<p>As those of you affected will know, a lot more needs to be done to work towards a long term solution, but these events will hopefully provide some short term ways to respond to the problem. The events are:</p>

    <title>Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chrisleslie.org/keuntungan-saat-memainkan-situs-judi-slot-online/"&gt;Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Internet memiliki dampak luar biasa pada berbagai industri meskipun mungkin industri perjudian yang paling banyak mengalami perubahan. Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mari kita ulas bersama tentang keuntungan yang akan di dapatkan saat memainkan situs judi slot online ini yaitu;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apa Saja Keuntungan Saat Memainkan Situs Judi Slot Online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenyamanan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsi perbankan yang digunakan platform kasino online semuanya benar-benar aman dan memungkinkan seseorang untuk mendanai akunnya dengan mudah. Ada berbagai metode yang dapat dilakukan dan pengguna dapat memilih metode yang paling cocok untuk mereka. Bahkan banyak yang memberikan penawaran tambahan saat menggunakan layanan ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dapatkan Poin Hadiah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pada setiap taruhan permainan meja atau mesin slot memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengumpulkan poin hadiah. Ini tercantum dalam akun pemain dan dapat tertukar dengan permainan, hadiah, atau manfaat lainnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino tradisional juga memberikan poin hadiah, mereka biasanya membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk bertambah dengan platform online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilih taruhan yang Anda inginkan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform kasino online memberi Anda kebebasan untuk bermain di level mana pun yang Anda inginkan. Di sisi lain, rumah kasino tradisional memiliki batasan ketat pada tingkat di mana pengguna dapat bermain terutama karena mereka harus mempertahankan pendirian mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di situs kasino online, seseorang dapat memulai dengan bermain secara gratis atau dengan taruhan minimum. Ini memungkinkan seseorang kesempatan untuk mengambilnya selangkah demi selangkah dan meningkatkannya secara progresif saat seseorang menjadi lebih nyaman, atau mendapatkan kemenangan beruntun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>).

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
