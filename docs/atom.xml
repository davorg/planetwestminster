    <title>Preet discusses the impact of climate change on women and girls with the Women’s Institute  </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-discusses-impact-climate-change-women-and-girls-women%E2%80%99s-institute" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Ahead of COP26, local MP Preet Kaur Gill who serves as shadow secretary for international development, met with the local Harborne Village branch from the Women’s Institute (WI) to discuss the impact that climate change is having on the lives of women and girls across the world.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston, Birmingham said, “We have seen that time and again, women and girls are bearing the brunt of the climate change crisis, and this is exactly what is at stake for COP26. The Government is running out of time to make the summit a success, but it’s not too late. It is vital for everyone that the Prime Minister steps up and get the agreements with nations around the world to commit to the cause of climate crisis.” </p>
<p>The impact of climate change is not affecting people equally. Women and girls are being displaced from their communities, are facing gender violence and are being forced to drop out of education all due to climate-related disasters. Child marriage is used by families to cope with economic hardships caused by climate change. This puts millions of girls at risk of sexual and physical abuse, early pregnancy and maternal death. </p>
<p>Preet continued, “Climate change cannot be tackled in isolation that is why it was fantastic to be able to discuss this with local WI groups. We all need to play our part and it was an honour to see the action being taken by local residents.” </p>
<p>At the meeting, WI members from Harborne Village presented Preet with ‘no more loopholes’ bracelets. </p>
<p>Lynda Gibbon, WI member from Harborne Village explained, “It was fantastic to be able to discuss the issue with Preet and pass on these bracelets. A common criticism of climate conferences is that they ‘manufacture loopholes’, delivering agreements which allow national Governments worldwide to avoid fully implementing high-ambition climate agreements or emissions reductions.  </p>
<p>“As COP26 hosts, the UK Government has a responsibility to make sure that all climate agreements produced at COP26 are without these loopholes, delivering a greener, cleaner and healthier future for everyone, especially those that are the most climate vulnerable.  </p>
<p>“These bracelets form a physical representation of this situation – crochet is formed by creating a series of loops using a hook.” </p>

    <title>Do not send motorway sit down protesters to prison</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/10/29/do-not-send-motorway-sit-down-protesters-to-prison/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I have no wish to load the prisons with the protesters who block main roads. Some of them want to be sent there to heighten their newsworthiness. There are often too many to send them all. Why should we taxpayers have to pay more to keep them in prison to increase the coverage they get?</p>
<p>A friend this week suggested to me a punishment for deliberately blocking the highway as part of a protest which might  better fit the crime and might be more of a deterrent to many of them. Why not make the penalty the loss of your driving licence? The crime would be deliberately blocking the road as a protest. The police and courts could remove as many licences as there were protesters with licences.</p>
<p>The protesters should welcome this. As they want us all to create less carbon dioxide we would be enabling them to do just that themselves, by banning them from using personal transport in future. It would force them to do as they preach, going by bike or public transport. The ones who do make their own sacrifices already would not mind, whilst many of them who lecture the rest of us how to live but do not follow their own advice would face a disagreeable penalty that did inconvenience them .</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>

    <title>Karin Smyth MP condemns Autumn Spending Review for hitting working families hardest</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has condemned the Autumn Spending Review for hitting working people hardest, with each household in Bristol South having faced a £3000 tax increase since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>This week’s budget confirmed taxes will reach their highest level in over seventy years, rising to 36.2% in 2026/27, the highest level since 1949/50.  This is also the biggest tax rise in nearly three decades.  With the UK Government refusing to reinstate the Universal Credit £20 a week uplift, an ongoing cost of living crisis and real wages falling, working people are left shouldering the burden whilst the Chancellor announced a £4 billion tax cut for banks’ profits.</p>
<p>The UK has suffered the largest economic hit from coronavirus and is also suffering the slowest recovery of any major advanced economy.  Public services like the NHS are facing mounting pressure, but the Chancellor only gave a vague commitment  to spending more on doctors and nurses with no detail on how the UK Government actually plans to recruit and train more staff for the NHS.  With the NHS short of 40,000 nurses and 1,100 fewer GPs now than in 2016, an investment plan to address workforce shortages is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth was also disappointed by the Chancellor’s decision to cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) for internal flights within the United Kingdom. This measure will do nothing to encourage people away from high-polluting modes of transport. Currently, it is significantly cheaper for people to travel to Edinburgh by plane from Bristol Airport rather than by train. A quick search online shows that a flight will cost only £29.99 to Edinburgh, whereas travel by train will cost £97.20. This Budget completely failed to achieve green outcomes for the country.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: </p>
<p>“This Budget shows just how out of touch the Chancellor’s priorities are. Working families are being left to carry the burden of higher taxes whilst bankers are being given a tax cut.  Never have the British people had to pay so much for so little in return, it’s a disgrace.</p>
<p>“From no workforce plan for the NHS to recruit more doctors and nurses, to a shortfall in funding for the education recovery and only a couple of passing references to the climate crisis, the Chancellor is neglecting areas that will benefit working people in Bristol South and around the country.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government would put working people first, using the power of government and skill of business to ensure the next generation of quality, green jobs are created right here in Britain.  We’d tax fairly, spend wisely and prioritise the green recovery.  Working families deserve better.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/10/28/karin-smyth-mp-condemns-autumn-spending-review-for-hitting-working-families-hardest/">Karin Smyth MP condemns Autumn Spending Review for hitting working families hardest</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>Post Office closures</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/10/post-office-closures/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For 361 years the Post Office has been at the heart of the community, and post offices have established themselves as the backbones of local economies across the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith, the hon. Members for Keighley (Robbie Moore), for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Jamie Stone), for Strangford (Jim Shannon), for East Renfrewshire (Kirsten Oswald) and the SNP spokesperson, the hon. Member for Glasgow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East (David Linden), have spoken of the contribution that post offices make to our constituencies. The network provides over 170 essential services to 17 million customers and one third of small businesses each and every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, the pandemic has highlighted how vital a reliable postal service is—I am sure that we all appreciated that during the pandemic. A survey by the National Federation of SubPostmasters found that 97% of post offices that remained open during lockdown did so to support their local communities. Sub-postmasters stepped up as key workers, not only keeping us connected but going above and beyond their job descriptions by offering services such as grocery deliveries for vulnerable customers. I thank them for their work during the pandemic, and also pay tribute to the CWU for its support and campaigning on post offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this debate has shown, postal services matter to everyone, but customers and businesses in the most rural and vulnerable communities are paying the biggest price for closures. A 2015 freedom of information request revealed that, out of the 20 north-east branches marked as temporarily closed, 17 were closed for more than a year and seven for more than five years. To put that in context, the north-east has 499 open branches, already the lowest number in any UK region. Hon. Members have spoken of concerns about closures in their constituencies. In my own constituency of Newcastle upon Tyne Central, we have seen a number of closures, often in deprived areas such as Kenton, where I grew up. Other branches have moved into private sector operations, despite opposition from local MPs and residents. For example, the Gosforth high street post office was moved to a convenience store on a secluded residential street, without nearby bus stops or non-permit parking—a decision made with complete disregard for accessibility. We have heard from hon. Members of similar experiences in their constituencies. In 2019, the former Minister, the hon. Member for Rochester and Strood (Kelly Tolhurst), stated to the BEIS Committee that it was a Government commitment to maintain the post office network at 11,500 branches. Does the Minister plan to uphold that commitment in our post-pandemic economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only 1% of branches managed directly by the Post Office, many sub-postmasters are relying on the Government’s subsidy to remain financially viable. However, sub-postmasters are resigning at a faster rate than they can be replaced due to the difficulty in making a decent living. That has been a major driving force in the decline of the network. In 2019, the National Federation of SubPostmasters found that 76% of members were struggling to earn the national minimum hourly wage, resulting in an estimated 22% planning to downsize or close their post office in the coming year. What recent discussions has the Minister had with Post Office Ltd on the incomes of sub-postmasters, and what steps he is taking to minimise the risk of further closures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, reduced footfall and post offices’ inability to access many coronavirus support packages saw many temporary closures become permanent. Between March and April 2020, the number of open branches fell by 651 from 11,638, and 388 of those closures were of outreach services in the most remote parts of the UK. In August, the BBC reported that 260 temporarily closed branches were still closed as of 30 June 2021. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the number of open branches returns to pre-pandemic levels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post office subsidy provides a fixed amount of remuneration to an estimated 5,000 post offices, including 1,600 outreach services operating from mobile vans and village halls on a part-time basis. But the Government have ignored the importance of the subsidy, which has decreased from £210 million in 2012-13 to £50 million in 2020-21. Two years ago, the hon. Member for Rochester and Strood told a Select Committee that the Government would look to continue to support the post office network, sharing this responsibility with Post Office Ltd. Much has changed since this pre-pandemic statement. What assessment has the Minister made of the ongoing impact of covid on post offices, and how does he plan to fulfil that promise in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I welcomed the announcement of a £227 million investment, including a £50 million subsidy to support the rural post office network. However, the CWU rightly stated that it is unlikely that this investment will be sufficient given the amount the post office will have to raise to cover future legal claims associated with the Horizon scandal, which remains the greatest public scandal that our country has suffered, and the implications of which are still being felt by many current and former sub-postmasters who are struggling to gain the compensation the Minister seemed to promise. The more than 900 false prosecutions resulting from the Horizon scandal destroyed lives, families and reputations, and we have yet to see public confidence restored. Indeed, I do not believe that public confidence will be restored without justice for those whose lives were ruined. The Government must ensure that this justice does not come at the expense of our post office network’s survival. What steps is the Minister taking to maintain the financial viability of the Post Office, and will considerations be made for the continuation of the subsidy beyond 2022?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many Members have spoken about the importance of access to cash. It is worth noting that the subsidy I have spoken about is for the rural networks, but with 55 banks closing every month and up to 8 million people relying on cash daily, the impact of closures on access to cash in both rural communities and urban ones such as my own must be considered. The post office network provides financial services to individuals who are digitally excluded, are ineligible for a bank account, or use cashless services. In 2019, a report by LINK found that 47% of the UK population believes that losing that access to cash would present real challenges. Despite that, 10% of free-to-use ATMs were disconnected during the pandemic, further exacerbating the lack of access. Post offices have been left to pick up the slack, with recent figures suggesting that they will shortly exceed £3 billion a month in cash deposits and withdrawals for the first time in history, so I ask the Minister what assessment he has made of the impact of bank closures on the importance of the post office network, and what plans he has to ensure that banks offer support to post offices that take up their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have heard, post offices across the country offer more than commercial services: they are a source of social interaction for the vulnerable and lonely, a key touchpoint between people and Government services, and a vital part of local communities. The Post Office is a great British institution that has fulfilled a social purpose for centuries, but it is also an institution that the Government are failing to support. Managed decline is the story of our times under the Conservative Government. Labour is committed to protecting our post office network, and will fight to ensure that postmasters are given the support that is needed to guarantee that network’s survival. I hope the Minister will join us in that mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Budget 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/the-budget-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out on behalf of the Government a budget that seeks to look to a more optimistic future as we move beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst we have endured challenging times, the budget prepares a new economy with higher wages, higher skills and rising productivity which will deliver for all the residents of Aldridge-Brownhills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ability to be able to successfully fight the Covid-19 pandemic was due to the enormous effort of our precious National Health Service. It was therefore extremely welcome news that there would be further investment in our NHS with a commitment to 40 new hospitals and the recruitment of 50,000 new nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget once again reaffirmed our commitment to hard working families with a 6.6% increase in the National Living Wage equivalent of £1,000, and a tax cut for families on Universal Credit putting more money back in their pockets. Recognising the squeeze that so many families are feeling due to the increase in fuel prices the Chancellor scrapped the anticipated rise in fuel duty, saving families’ money at the pumps will be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government’s priority as we move beyond the global pandemic is an ambitious programme of frontline investment to level up right across our country to close the gap between London and regions like ours. As independent commentators have observed our economy is fundamentally strong and whilst Covid-19 has had an impact on our economy, the Government stands on the side of families and businesses to support our precious public services and business community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public services are the People’s Priorities and at the heart of the budget was support for young people with an investment of over £500 million in youth services, 30,000 new school places for Special Educational Needs, a further £3 billion to help all pupils as part of the Covid-19 education recovery fund and a £4.7 billion of funding for education meaning per pupil funding will rise on average to £1,500 per pupil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sustained investment to deliver on key infrastructure projects, research and development and a commitment to greater productivity across the economy we will deliver on our ambition for Britain to be a global leader. With record investment in new transport projects the West Midlands Mayor Andy Street will receive more than £1billion for new transportation projects across our region to help level up our local areas and extend our economic reach. At the same time the new funding also represents a major step forward to realise my long held ambition to reopen a railway station in Aldridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commitment to build 180,000 new affordable new homes with a £1.8 billion investment in brownfield development means we will get the homes we need in the right places. It will also mean that we can protect our precious Green Belt and truly live up to our ambition of a ‘Brownfield First’ approach to development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This additional funding will be extremely important to all of us in Aldridge-Brownhills as we continue to work with Mayor Andy Street to stop speculative and unsuitable development on our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting businesses and High Streets is a key part of our economic recovery and I was pleased the Chancellor announced the long awaited review of Business Rates. I was also pleased that next year’s planned increases in Business Rates have been halted and that our Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Sector will receive a 50% discount, helping our High Streets and Village Centres through challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Government we are focussed on ensuring that we have Higher Skills, Higher Productivity and Higher Wages focussing on the ‘People’s Priorities’. The Budget represents our commitment to level up right across the whole United Kingdom delivering on our promises to the British people and all of the hard working families of Aldridge-Brownhills.&lt;/p&gt;

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Once again, my annual Christmas Card Competition was a major success last year – with hundreds of amazing designs submitted by local primary school pupils in our area.</p>

<p>That’s why I am delighted to be launching the Competition again, having now written to all Mid Norfolk primary schools to ask for their youngster’s help and creativity to design my Christmas Card for 2021.</p>

<p>All primary school children in Mid Norfolk are welcome to enter the competition with the winning design featuring on the front of the 2021 Christmas Cards and two runners-up appearing on the reverse. This year, the top prize for my favourite design will be £20 in book tokens, followed by each of the two runners-up being rewarded with £10 of book tokens.</p>

<p>As ever, I hope the competition might help to inspire the next generation of promising artists with some festive fun! Set out below is the very simple process:</p>

<p>* Each school must send in their pupils’ designs (in one ‘pack’ please) no later than Friday 19th November (I’m afraid Christmas card logistics mean late entries can’t be considered).</p>

<p>* ‘Packs’ may be sent in by post to: 8 Damgate Street, Wymondham, NR18 0BQ or scanned and emailed to: george.freeman.mp@parliament.uk</p>

<p>* The card itself must be hand drawn on a blank white A4 piece of paper/card.</p>

<p>* Every entry must have the child’s name, age, school name and card title carefully written on the back of the card design.</p>

<p>My wife Fiona and I always love to see the wonderful entries that are submitted and are very much looking forward to seeing this year’s designs.</p>

<p>If YOUR school is interested in participating, please do get in touch.</p>

<p>Winning design 2020:</p></div>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Ahead of the UN Climate Summit COP26, South Shropshire MP, Philip Dunne, took part in UK Parliament’s first-ever debate on climate education.</p>

<p>The Westminster Hall Debate, tabled by Nadia Whittome MP, a member of the Environmental Audit Committee, examined sustainability and climate education in the UK curriculum.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne pointed to recommendations in the Green Jobs report, published this week by the Environmental Audit Committee, which called for inclusion of climate change in the national curriculum, to help boost skills in the green economy.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne, who chairs the Committee, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was pleased to attend this timely debate, since it enabled me to endorse our recommendations - to include sustainability and climate change in the school curriculum - as our report into Green Jobs which came out on Monday called for.</p>

<p>“Raising awareness and interest in climate change impact and adaptation is critical to help develop the skills we need for the green economy. By encouraging pupils to develop their interest and understanding of environmental issues at school, we can not only give greater employment opportunities in all regions of the UK, but also help ensure that we are working towards meeting net zero by 2050.”</p>

    <title>Gwynne welcomes funding to make Reddish North Station fully accessible</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-234543" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RNS-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RNS-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RNS-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RNS-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RNS-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RNS.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is today celebrating the news that funding has finally been secured to make Reddish North Station fully accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, one platform at Reddish North station can only be reached via a Victorian footbridge, rendering it completely inaccessible to wheelchair users, parents with buggies, or people with mobility problems. However, it has been confirmed that part of the £1bn pounds awarded to Greater Manchester as part of the Government&amp;#8217;s recent budget announcements will go towards making Reddish North Station fully accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news comes after years of campaigning by Reddish resident Nathaniel Yates, who has highlighted the inaccessibility of Manchester Stations and has gained the support of Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Burnham has been lobbying the Government for additional funding for the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is understood that as part of the £1 billion, seven &amp;#8216;Access for All&amp;#8217; stations will be delivered at Swinton, Reddish North, Hindley, Flowery Fields, Bryn, Newton for Hyde and Levenshulme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcoming the announcement, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is fantastic and very long-overdue news. I would like to thank Nathaniel Yates for his incredible and tireless campaigning on this issue. He has done such a fantastic job of raising accessibility issues across Greater Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This funding will finally make it possible for passengers with mobility impairments to access the station. It has been a long time coming, and I&amp;#8217;m really grateful to Transport for Greater Manchester and Andy Burnham for working so hard to get some proper investment from the Government for these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to see a Greater Manchester that is accessible to everyone. There is still a long way to go in making all our stations fully accessible, but this is a really important step on that journey.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>By the time you read this, we&#8217;ll have learned if there are any surprises left in the budget.</p>



<p>It was once a huge political event, shrouded in secrecy. Back in 1947, a throwaway remark cost chancellor Hugh Dalton his job but now Rishi Sunak briefs the contents to Sunday papers.</p>



<p>Any good news is re-announced endlessly.</p>



<p>Parts of the transport plan have been announced more than 60 times but new money is only about £1.5 billion as opposed to the £7 billion the chancellor claims in his press release.</p>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t trust an accountant or social club treasurer who lied about the figures so it does make me wonder about this chancellor.</p>



<p>One widely pre-briefed element is his concern for children, accompanied by lovely photographs of him with the kids.</p>



<p>To be fair, he has a young family and is no doubt a devoted dad but he also has extremely wealthy in-laws which puts him in a very different situation to most young families in my constituency.</p>



<p>He says he&#8217;s releasing £80 million to establish 75 family hubs around the country. I support that but doubt 75 will compensate for the 1,000 children&#8217;s centres we&#8217;ve lost under 11 years of Tory rule.</p>



<p>He also ought to do something about childcare costs. Nurseries are being forced to close because he won&#8217;t fund them properly and many childminders can&#8217;t make ends meet. Nearly 3,000 childcare providers have closed since January.</p>



<p>The pandemic aside, the real problem is that after 11 years, the chickens are coming home to roost. Neglect of training has caused employment shortages in key areas of our economy.</p>



<p>As the spectre of rising inflation threatens a cost-of-living crisis, we are paying the price of cuts and under investment over a decade, while too much money has been spent on the wrong things.</p>



<p>The chancellor must now decide if he&#8217;s prepared to take from those with the broadest shoulders but cuts to the pension triple lock, universal credit and increases in National Insurance suggest he&#8217;s already decided who should bear the brunt.</p>



<p>I doubt there are any good surprises left.</p>

                <em>This is going to be a tough winter for millions of people, and more so in areas like Dagenham and Rainham with high levels of food and fuel poverty. The Tory budget will deliver very little for ordinary people, instead prioritising tax breaks for big companies like Amazon whilst hitting working families with a record increase in national insurance.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>The cost of living is rising and yet again the Tories have produced a smoke and mirrors budget. The promise of increasing the national minimum wage is a positive step, but it follows cuts to Universal Credit, tax hikes and soaring energy prices, so it’s give with one hand and take with the other. </em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>Labour has a plan to ease the pressure on households right now. We’d abolish VAT on domestic energy bills for 6 months to help people get through the winter months. This would be a vital lifeline for people in my constituency.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>Covid isn’t solely to blame for the economic problems we face. In the years running up to the pandemic, successive Tory governments weakened the foundations of our economy, and stripped public services bare leaving fewer police on the streets, growing class sizes and long waits at A&amp;E.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>Labour has a plan to deliver for hard working families in areas like Dagenham and Rainham. We’ll Buy, Make and Sell More in Britain by bringing jobs back to this country. Labour in local government are already doing it – bringing London’s three historic markets to Dagenham alongside a new film studio, putting our area at the heart of the capital’s trade.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>We’ll bring in a New Deal for Working People so people earn a proper wage that they can raise a family on, providing better job security and a right to flexible working. We’ll deliver efficient, modern public services that drive up standards across all sectors, and we will get real value for money for taxpayers by setting up a dedicated department to scrutinise spending.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>In contrast to this Conservative government, Labour will tax fairly, spend wisely, and get our economy firing on all cylinders.</em>

<p>Parliament said goodbye to Sir David Amess this week.</p>



<p>The murdered MP for Southend was a lovely, gentle, kind man with a perky sense of humour and endless, boundless energy for helping the people he represented in Parliament.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just who he was that mattered; it is what his death means for our democracy too. Britain is averaging about one attack every five years on MPs since 2000, and a quick social media search will show you it’s the tip of an iceberg of online abuse, hate and threats that has become a routine part of our public debate. It’s particularly bad if you’re a woman or a minority, but everyone gets it (including me) and it isn’t just MPs in Parliament either; Councillors in Town Halls are increasingly on the receiving end too.</p>



<p>It shouldn’t be this way. We have to be able to agree to disagree politely and respectfully with our neighbours, or our friends, or our family without deciding that, just because someone has reached a different but deeply-held view from us, that somehow makes them evil, or dishonest, or less than us. Otherwise things will never improve.</p>



<p>That was the message from every MP and every Peer in the House of Lords, in every political Party, as we remembered Sir David. And then, on a sombre and grey autumn day with dead leaves falling from the trees, we processed slowly across the road to Parliament’s parish church, St Margaret’s that’s built right next to Westminster Abbey, for a remembrance service.</p>



<p>But then, at the end, a remarkable thing happened. We stood for the first hymn, and it turned out that Parliament can sing. Not the quiet and slightly-embarrassed mumbling you get in some services, but a loud, joyful, beautiful sound instead. All of us, together, in tune and in harmony, singing for David. If only our politics was always like that.</p>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is good to see that HIAL and the union Prospect are moving towards the right outcome. It was certainly worth defending these airport jobs and I am pleased that political colleagues of all parties, across the Highlands and Islands, joined with myself and Alister Carmichael of Orkney and Shetland, to get the right decision with regards to island jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am sure that Scottish Government Ministers will be delighted that the scrutiny from 5 political parties means savings of £2 million for them, each and every year, by keeping the jobs in the islands, rather than centralising in Inverness. &amp;nbsp;This is the right decision and I congratulate HIAL and the union Prospect, for their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This issue is too important for our communities; we need to maintain island jobs and that has also saved the Government&amp;#8217;s purse.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<div>I had sought to speak in today’s debate on my colleague Barry Gardiner MP’s Private Members’ Bill, and this is the speech that I would have given, if the Deputy Speaker had called me.</div>
</div>

<div dir="ltr">
<div id="ms-outlook-mobile-signature">
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Thank you Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
<p>I commend my friend and comrade, the honourable member for Brent North, on bringing forward his Private Members’ Bill which is sensible, does not ban Fire and Rehire outright, but will instantiate good practice in statute – placing an obligation on employers to consult, to be transparent, and to negotiate up front when considering restructuring. And will penalise bad practice and bullying.</p>
<p>As with any Bill, it is amendable at the committee, and further stages, as it passes through the legislative process.</p>
<p>In Asda, Tesco’s, British Gas, Heathrow, and in the public sector, we’ve witnessed Fire and Rehire practices and their devastating impact on hardworking people.</p>
<p>Thousands of loyal, hardworking staff have been sacked because they refused to agree to poorer terms and conditions, with cuts of up to 15% in wages.</p>
<p>And the use of this unconscionable tactic has increased during the pandemic – one in ten workers have faced a Fire and Rehire process.</p>
<p>Fire and Rehire  is a fundamental failure of industrial relations, and a complete disregard of a worker’s experience, and loyalty.</p>
<p>And a return to archaic working practices.</p>
<p>We should look to Wales, where fairness and fair play are at the heart of Welsh Community values and has always shaped the relationship between employers, Trade Unions &amp; employees.</p>
<p>This tradition has been firmly embedded in the Welsh Government since the very start of devolution, where partnership working has been the norm, and expressed in key policy initiatives such as the economic contract where Welsh Government funding is conditional on good employment practices.</p>
<p>And which culminates today in the Welsh Labour Government Social Partnership Bill which will put partnership working and decent conditions of employment on a statutory basis using Welsh Government procurement processes as an instrument to drive best practice.</p>
<p>Therefore Fire and Rehire is an absolute anathema in Wales, contrary to our traditions and our deeply-rooted sense of fair play and decency which are at the heart of our national character.</p>
<p>The First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford has met the Honourable Member for Brent North and Mark has offered his full support for the objectives of the bill and the injustices it will root out.</p>
<p>In Wales we have a phrase, ‘chawrae teg’, – fair play – and everyone knows what it means whether they speak Welsh or not. This is a chance for the house to bring chwarae teg to workers across the whole of the U.K.</p>

    <title>REPORT: Inverness – One City, One Vision</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="xmsonormal"><i>Almost 21 years ago, Inverness became a City, yet we’ve never set out a shared vision of what kind of city it could and should be. Collectively we have missed this opportunity, and that includes me when I was Council leader. Now is a good time to correct that, look forward, and address the question – what is the vision for Inverness City?</i></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><i>What I know for sure is that to fully answer that question, we need to capture the spirit and hopes of people living here.  The answer lies in their ambitions for the place they live and their families, and we need to build these into the decisions we make today and in the future. </i></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><i>This isn’t a mere planning exercise, nor is it the responsibility of any single organisation – we all have a role to play and to get this right we need to work collectively, openly, across organisations and the political divide. </i></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><i>If we don’t seize the opportunity to set out a vision for the city, we will unintentionally make growth harder on ourselves, inhibiting business growth and reducing the wealth and well-being of the people living in the city and across the Highlands. So, why not make it easier on ourselves and work together to describe the next chapter of Inverness. </i></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><i>This vision is a taste of what Inverness could be in 2035. Imagine how much easier decisions about infrastructure and investment become if we have a collective understanding of why we are doing what we are doing. I am grateful to those who have given their time to work on this vision document; it is about starting a conversation and posing the most important question – if not this, then what? Hopefully, we all agree, we can’t continue to leave the question unanswered.   </i></p>

	&lt;div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " &gt;
		&lt;div class="wpb_wrapper"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Chancellor&amp;#8217;s presenting the Budget and Spending Review to the Commons next week, I have written to him to make the case for Oldham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter can be read in full below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Chancellor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTUMN BUDGET 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am writing to you to make the case for Oldham in your forthcoming Budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conservative Government has made a commitment to ‘level up’ across the country. I welcome this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe that given the challenges the people of Oldham are currently facing and have been facing over the last decade or so, Oldham should be a high priority for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example, over the last 11 years while the Conservatives have been in power, life expectancy for Oldham women has decreased to 80.5 years, and life expectancy for men has barely changed at 77.17 years. This compares with the average life expectancy of a woman in England of 83.1 years and for a man of 79.4 years. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you know, our life expectancy is an outcome of our socio-economic circumstances; these health inequalities – the difference in how long we’re going to live and live in good health – are not inevitable; they are driven by the political choices that are made, including in your Budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prime Minister has pledged to support Professor Sir Michael Marmot’s recommendations to &lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-01-27/debates/6775A7DF-70AE-4198-8F00-57D12516675D/Covid-19Update?highlight=marmot#contribution-A28A5018-5021-4643-ABD3-C84479256D7D"&gt;Build Back Fairer &lt;/a&gt;after his Covid Review last December revealed the UK’s high and unequal Covid death toll was driven by structural inequalities and austerity. As such I urge you to ensure that ‘health and wellbeing’ is at the heart of your economic strategy, including this autumn’s Budget. This means that ‘levelling up’ is woven into all policies and investment decisions and is not just a casual add-on to various pet projects. To do this, you must assess the impacts of your policies on tackling inequality as they are being developed and most certainly, before they are implemented. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second key principle is that you must decentralise power and control away from Westminster to our local communities, not just through local and regional elected representatives, but also directly.  An example of this is listening to local communities about their views on planning. Local people and Oldham Council have consistently told the Government that the level of housing development that the Government wants is unrealistic and doesn’t reflect the needs of our population now or in the future. I’ve &lt;a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/response-to-draft-gmsf-consultation/"&gt;consistently said&lt;/a&gt; that when new homes are built, they must be on Brownfield sites first. To do this, the Government needs to increase the funding to help clean up any contaminated land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thirdly, investment must go to where it’s needed. This applies to all public spending. The last 11 years have seen a shameful disinvestment in funding for local authorities like Oldham by successive Conservative-Liberal Democrat and Conservative Governments. Oldham Council has had to make savings of more than £200m from their Budget over the last decade or so, halving its budget. Over the next two financial years, it is looking at having to cut another £30m in further budget savings. This austerity has seen local services cut or reduced as a direct result of these cuts to local authority funding. And yet &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/24/deprived-urban-areas-shoulder-burden-of-funding-cuts"&gt;analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Centre for Cities&lt;/a&gt; reveals that it is metropolitan councils like Oldham that experience the biggest funding gaps. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00110-9/fulltext"&gt;strong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pldr.org/2021/09/30/what-did-local-government-ever-do-for-us/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing a link between these cuts and declining life expectancy in areas like Oldham.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This must be recognised in the Budget and ensure that those areas with the most need are appropriately funded. You must not repeat the mistakes of last year by largely predicating any increase in local authority budgets on an assumption of a rise in council tax and the social care precept. In the current circumstances as my constituents face significant cost of living increases, including fuel, energy and food prices as well as the NICs increase, a Council Tax/social care precept increase for Oldhamers would be highly inappropriate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Similarly, the NHS’ resource allocations must better reflect the health needs of our communities. The &lt;a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/comprehensive-spending-review-health-and-care-spending"&gt;King’s Fund estimate&lt;/a&gt; that people in deprived areas are likely to wait twice as long for NHS treatments compared with people in more affluent areas; couple that with the unmet need that has plagued our system and the&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00505-5/fulltext#:~:text=Simply%20expressed%2C%20Tudor%20Hart%20observed,advantaged%20populations%2C%20but%20receive%20less.&amp;amp;text=The%20inverse%20care%20law%20is,inequalities%20(imbalances)%20in%20health"&gt; inequality in healthcare access is perpetuated&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being hugely let down by this Government’s lack of emergency preparedness, our public health teams have been magnificent during the Covid pandemic. In addition to infectious disease control their work covers disease prevention and health improvement. But their budgets are already 24% lower than 2015. With Covid infections at such high levels, it is a matter of time before another variant of concern, potentially resistant to the vaccinations, emerges. If the Government has learned from their mistakes over the last 20 months, if they are serious about protecting our citizens and protecting our most vulnerable, to ‘&lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/107790/E89383.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;levelling up&lt;/a&gt;’ this must be addressed. Related to this, the Contain Outbreak Management Fund is due to come to an end in March. Discontinuing this funding would further expose not just Oldham but the country to future Covid outbreaks. It would be wholly irresponsible of the Government.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I share the Government’s vision for a high skill, high pay economy. However, areas like Oldham are further away from this reality than others. This requires appropriate investment within our education and training systems in recognition of this. But 11 years on, your Government’s pre-pandemic action to address Oldham’s educational challenges and the inequalities that our children and young people face has been woefully inadequate. As we emerge from the Pandemic, you must listen to our educators about the catch-up support that they need, reflecting the higher numbers of teaching days lost as a result of additional local Covid restrictions. Similarly, the failure to fully fund Oldham schools the pupil premium for those pupils who had become eligible for free school meals as a result of the pandemic is reprehensible. Over a thousand Oldham children missed out on this extra support worth £1,249,575. This must be rectified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oldham’s economy reflects our industrial heritage. Our future success will depend on: investment in ‘green’ industries and technologies, increased business investment in the workforce and infrastructure, retraining/reskilling Oldhamers for new work and increased physical and virtual connectivity. We welcome the £24.4m in Town Funding for Oldham town centre; however, this predominantly capital funding barely scratches the surface in tackling the needs of our borough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate action must start at home. By investing £28bn every year until 2030 to tackle the climate crisis, we can protect the planet and create good quality, secure jobs in Oldham and across the UK.  As COP hosts, the UK should be leading the way, but while the USA is pressing on with a $1 trillion green infrastructure plan and Germany and France are pouring tens of billions of euros into low-carbon initiatives, the Government’s 10-Point Plan entailed just £4 billion of new funding, £1 billion of which was then scrapped alongside the disastrous Green Homes Grant scheme. It doesn’t come close to matching the scale of the jobs crisis or the climate emergency we face, and it is undermining the credibility of our COP Presidency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been campaigning for several years to address the abuse of late payments to small businesses where 45% of UK workers are employed.  Late payments are a key issue for small businesses and currently stand at £50bn.  I urge you to implement my Project Bank Account Bill to protect small businesses not only from late payments but also bankruptcy should Tier 1 supplier companies collapse, as we saw with Carillion. Ironically, my late payment campaign started because an Oldham haulier was going out of business because of these late payments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the meantime, while Oldham businesses invest to increase their productivity and Oldhamers upskill to get better paid jobs, the 11,000 currently in low paid work and reliant on Universal Credit and their 22,500 children, must be adequately supported. The Budget must reinstate £20 per week for Universal Credit or provide equivalent social security support. They must not be allowed to fall into debt, rent arrears and worse or they will struggle to recover leaving another generation in the cycle of poverty too many experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I urge you to support the Greater Manchester Mayor’s ‘Levelling Up Deal’ which is a serious, positive offer to Government to deliver a London-style transport network with affordable London-level fares, accelerating Greater Manchester’s plans for a net zero future with better, greener homes and communities, as well as better jobs and skills. It can’t be right that a single bus fare is £1.50 in London but £4.40 across Greater Manchester, including areas of multiple deprivation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, I urge you to address the systemic issues in our society which sees two women a week die at the hands of their partners or ex-partners. Violence against women and girls, including sexual exploitation, has remained hidden and unchallenged for too long. That has to change now. It requires leadership and we hope you can demonstrate this in your Budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I look forward to your response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This letter will be put in the public domain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debbie Abrahams MP                                &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>I was shocked and upset when I received the news about Sir David Amess. He was a dedicated, thoughtful man and a true Parliamentarian and a tremendous colleague. My memories of him will always be of him as a positive, friendly, and unendingly helpful at guiding new MPs- as he did with me more than once when I was first elected.</p>
<p>No-one deserves to have their life taken like this. David was murdered doing what he always saw as his number 1 priority- helping his constituents. The fact that he always conducted his surgeries so openly is testament to his belief in being accessible to his electors, and makes it all the more shocking that he was the target of this heinous crime.</p>
<p>I will always remember David as a true gent, who fought for what he believed in and the people he represented with conviction and determination. He will be missed dearly by everyone in the House of Commons, regardless of political party or background- above all, because he represented the very best of the meaning of public service.</p>
<p>Since David’s murder, there have rightly been questions asked about the safety of MPs and surgeries. Whilst we always keep our measures under review, we have to ensure that this does not alter the fundamental right that constituents have to be able to access their MP. I had the privilege of serving in parliament with Sir David Amess and am absolutely certain that the last thing he would want from this tragedy would be more distance between MPs and their constituents. Whatever the outcome, I am committed that people will always be able to contact me for help, regardless of how they vote. That is what is so special about our system of representative democracy. It is not all that common, even in other democracies, and we owe it to David to maintain the tradition.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Judith&amp;#8217;s latest op-ed for the Telegraph &amp;amp; Argus Weds 13 October 2021:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With winter almost upon us, we see the Government of our country in chaos and our country teetering on the brink of crisis with queues at the forecourts; empty shelves and energy prices skyrocketing. A basic principle of government is to insulate the country from external shocks, but a lack of planning, a Prime Minister seemingly absent from duty and soaking up the Marbella sun and cabinet ministers squabbling is in fact risking turning crises into disasters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past week we’ve seen denials from the Treasury that the claims of the Secretary of State for Business, Kwasi Kwarteng MP, that he is speaking to the Chancellor about urgent support for firms struggling with fast-rising energy prices are untrue – who are we meant to believe? But more importantly, the question I ask is why the Chancellor and the Business Secretary are not talking to each other to avert a fast-approaching crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crisis where millions of families are set to be squeezed by a triple whammy of rising energy prices, an increase in national insurance, and the cut to Universal Credit. This will be felt by families not only in my Bradford South constituency and the wider Bradford District, but right across the country. Recent statistics show that the decisions of the Government will leave the average working family over £1700 worse off by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government must change course and protect working families whilst they still have the chance. By cancelling&amp;nbsp;the Universal Credit cut, dropping the tax rises on working people and businesses, and urgently exploring further measures to help households alleviate the cost of rising bills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning now to Northern Powerhouse Rail, reports are rife that the government is expected to block the inclusion of Bradford on the route in a bid to save money. Whilst for the current government spending money on Transport infrastructure in the South East is seen as an investment it appears that once again, spending money in the North is non-existent. This is just not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s time for the Prime Minister to put his money where his mouth is and deliver action on his levelling-up agenda, starting with a Bradford stop on the Northern Powerhouse rail route.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as delivering on improved infrastructure and opportunity for the North, the Prime Minister and his Government must work to urgently address backlogs in the DVLA. This coupled with the HGV driver shortage has left motorists struggling to fill up their cars and shops unable to fill the shelves to their usual capacity. Over the past few months, I’ve had many Bradford South constituents contact me to say that their license renewal has been pending for weeks; they are unable to contact the DVLA to progress or check the status of their application and some have even approached me to say that their employment is at risk because of DVLA delays. This cannot continue. We need the DVLA backlog to be resolved sooner rather than later. The government needs to get a grip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as issues with the DVLA, my mailbox has recently seen an increase in constituents contacting me who are struggling to get a face-to-face appointment with their GP. Whilst I and many others appreciate that for some people digital and remote consultations with their GP will be welcomed, it is imperative that face to face appointments continue to be commonplace and that all GP Practices are open and operational. Access to GP services is vital and I know that our GPs are trying their best in difficult circumstances, but they need better support from the Government to be able to triage and treat patients in way that works for all. That is why I have previously and will continue to raise access to GPs both locally with the Bradford District and Craven CCG and nationally with the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care to try and secure a better deal for both GPs and patients alike.  On a final note, next week parliament will return from the conference recess and there will be an important adjournment debate on Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) within Bradford. I’m clear that we need to reflect and learn lessons from the past and ensure that such acts cannot happen again. But I also feel just as strongly that we need to ensure that this debate looks at the ways in which agencies and individuals can all work together to make Bradford not only safer but the safest place in the country for children to grow up in. We’ve seen first-hand in our city what can happen when we don’t get this right, we cannot afford to let that happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>£499 million to build thousands of new affordable homes across the East Midlands</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2021/08/31/499-million-to-build-thousands-of-new-affordable-homes-across-the-east-midlands/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boston &amp;amp; Skegness will benefit from a £499 million investment to build 9,775 new affordable homes across the East Midlands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This funding has been allocated through the Conservative Government’s £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme, the largest single investment in affordable housing in a decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nearly 120,000 new homes will be built for young people and families – supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and helping more first-time buyers into home ownership to level up communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Warman MP has welcomed the £499m investment to deliver 9,775 new affordable homes across the East Midlands through the Conservative Government’s Affordable Homes Programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total £8.6 billion investment across England will help to build 119,000 new affordable homes, including 57,000 for ownership, 29,600 for social rent and 6,250 affordable rural homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new affordable homes available for ownership will help more young people and families to get a foot on the housing ladder, building on other schemes from the Conservative Government to help first-time buyers into homeownership, including First Homes – offering new homes at a 30 per cent discount on the open market value – and the 95 per cent mortgage guarantee scheme – which helps first-time buyers secure a mortgage with just a 5 per cent deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 30,000 homes for Social Rent – which are typically 50 to 60 per cent of market prices – will provide secure, affordable housing to people who need it most. It will also deliver new supported housing for some of the most vulnerable, providing much needed homes for older or disabled people with support needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investment is expected to support up to 370,000 construction jobs across the country for the home building industry including SME developers, major housebuilders and infrastructure specialists as well as the wider local economies – expecting to generate up to £26 billion of wider private and public investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the Conservative Government has delivered over 542,400 new affordable homes – and this investment marks an important step towards meeting its promise to deliver 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Matt Warman said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Owning your own home should not be the privilege of a few, but an affordable possibility for young people and families across Boston &amp;amp; Skegness and around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted thousands of people across the East Midlands will now have their dream of home ownership realised through the Affordable Homes Programme, with 9,775 homes delivered thanks to the Conservative Government’s £499million investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By helping more people and their families buy a home in their local area, we are levelling up opportunity across the country – while creating good skilled jobs as we build back better from the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creating more opportunities for home ownership is central to this government. This £9 billion funding is a landmark moment for our Affordable Homes Programme and will ensure good quality housing for all as we build back better after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This huge funding package will make the ambition of owning a home a reality for families by making it realistic and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are also ensuring tens of thousands of new homes for rent are built in the years ahead, including social rent, so those on the lowest incomes can enjoy good quality, secure rented homes, built and managed by reputable providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launching our £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme to provide 180,000 new homes across the country, helping extend the dream of homeownership to as many people as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Delivering over 5 years from 2021 to 2026, our £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme will provide up to 180,000 new homes across the country, should economic conditions allow. The programme will also unlock a further £38 billion in public and private investment in affordable housing, with new homes being made available from next year (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jenrick-unveils-huge-12-billion-boost-for-affordable-homes"&gt;MHCLG, Press Release, 8 September 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing £8.5 billion to build 119,000 new affordable homes across England, the single largest investment in affordable housing for a decade.&lt;/strong&gt; We are making £8.5 billion available through our £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme to every region across England, which will help deliver 119,000 new affordable homes – building on the over 542,400 new affordable homes we have delivered since 2010 (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/86-billion-for-affordable-homes-to-give-boost-onto-housing-ladder"&gt;MHCLG, Press Release, 31 August 2021&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds on our efforts to deliver the homes our communities need by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing total government investment in new housing to almost £20 billion.&lt;/strong&gt; The £7.1 billion National Home Building Fund will deliver our long-term housing strategy by unlocking 860,000 homes over the next four years – this sits alongside the £11.5 billion we are making available through the Affordable Homes Programme between 2021 and 2026 (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents"&gt;HMT, Spending Review 2020, 25 November 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the highest number of new homes in over 20 years, helping more people get onto the property ladder.&lt;/strong&gt; There were nearly 50,000 completed homes in the first quarter of 2021 – the highest figure in over 20 years and a 4 per cent increase compared to the last three months of 2020. During the same period, over 46,000 home builds were started, the highest number in nearly 15 years and a 7 per cent increase on the previous quarter (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-building-stats-show-continued-increase-in-starts-and-completions-despite-pandemic"&gt;MHCLG, Press Release, 1 July 2021&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering over 1.8 million homes since 2010, as we oversee a seventh consecutive year that the number of homes built has increased.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2019-20, we delivered 243,770 homes – the highest number in a single year since 1978 – representing the seventh consecutive year in a row that the number of homes delivered has increased. With 90 per cent comprising of new builds, this takes the total number of homes we have delivered to 1.8 million since 2010 (&lt;a href="https://www.buyassociation.co.uk/2020/12/04/housebuilding-soars-to-a-33-year-high-in-england/"&gt;Buy Association, 4 December 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Emma Meets with Tyne Tunnel 2 Executives</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-meets-with-tyne-tunnel-2-executives/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I met with the Chief Exec and Operations Manager of Tyne Tunnel 2 to raise concerns following a spike in complaints about the tunnel operators since the introduction of the controversial “pay later” scheme. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with many of the complaints, I believe that the payment instructions could be clearer. The ticket states a date and a time however, if you wait until the date shown, it’ll be too late and you’ll incur a £30 fine, I can see how many people are easily misunderstanding what the ticket says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, I asked the Chief Executive, Phill Smith if he could look at other options and suggested changes should be made to the wording on the tickets to make it clearer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I learnt about plans for the tunnel to remove the barriers completely in a new system called&amp;nbsp;Open Road Tolling.&amp;nbsp; This would mean that there would be no barriers and payments will need to be made either using an online account or the pay later option. Tyne Tunnel 2 say this would increase tunnel capacity, reduce carbon emissions and mean more a more reliable and quicker journey through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I again expressed concern that more drivers may receive fines, as the onus would be&amp;nbsp;on drivers to remember to pay the toll as under the new system, they would not receive a ticket which in many cases acts as a reminder. I also asked what facilities have TT2 put in place to support those drivers who do not have access to the internet, in order to pay their toll charge. It was explained that drivers who do not have smart phones or access to the internet could pay their toll at shops who have a PayPoint facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I feel many constituents’ pain and frustration. Many people have told me that the current system of pay later is confusing and lacks clarity, I agree and will continue to seek a resolution to this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Coronavirus issues and other local matters.<br/>
<strong><br/>
International Travel</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I have been asked by a number of people about the current rules for travel outside the UK and returning here. To find out what the rules are for entering any other country, you should look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Office Travel Advice</a>, which will tell you what the entry requirements are at the moment in each country.</p>
<p>For re-entering the UK, all of the current advice is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>South Western Railway &amp; Network Rail Timetable Consultation</strong></p>
<p>South Western Railway and Network Rail have launched a consultation about their plans for the post-Pandemic timetable from December 2022 onwards. This consultation is based on an assumption that considerably fewer people will be commuting going forward. The proposals represent a significant downgrading of the pre-pandemic timetable for our line into London Waterloo. They are intending to reduce the number of trains from Ashtead and Epsom in the peak from six trains an hour to four. This would be done by scrapping the services that start at Epsom and making the previous semi-fast service stop at Ewell West and Stoneleigh instead, as well as at all stations further in. At the same time they would make the current reduction in off-peak services permanent.</p>
<p>They will also at the same time introduce the new generation of trains onto our line, which are ten coaches with all of them connected to create an open plan route right through the train. Their argument is that the new trains will have significantly more capacity and will be able to carry as many people as before even with a reduced service. I do not buy that argument. I have met the company to raise my concerns about the plans, and I think it is much too early to judge what passenger numbers will be in nearly eighteen months time. This level of service would have been completely unworkable with pre-pandemic passenger numbers. I would encourage everyone to take part in the consultation and to make your view clear. The details are at <strong><a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/timetables/timetable-consultation-december-2022">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom &amp; Ewell Business Awards 2011-2021</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Epsom and Ewell Business Awards have just been launched for online entries and nominations. This will be the tenth year of the awards, and it’s a great opportunity to nominate your favourite local business, perhaps because of what they have done for you during the pandemic or because they just always look after you really well. Details of how to enter or nominate an entry are <strong><a href="https://www.epsombusinessawards.co.uk/">here</a></strong>. Please do get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering in the Local Community</strong></p>
<p>I know that many people locally put their names forward to volunteer in the community during the pandemic, and either have now finished that work or did not find the right opportunity to do so. If you are someone who is motivated to get involved or frustrated because your help wasn’t needed, I am planning a volunteering event to match potential volunteers with a small group of local charities who need extra help.</p>
<p>The event will be at <strong>St George’s, in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead on Friday 10th September</strong> from 4 until 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I will be sending out more details a few days before, but if you are interested please make a note in your diary.</p>
<p>I hope that you manage to enjoy something of a break this summer and that the weather improves.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br/>
Chris</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my July&nbsp;email newsletter. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well during this challenging time, as we start to try to return to normality from the pandemic and enjoy the Summer, whilst still trying to be cautious and sensible with precautions where possible&nbsp;in the face of rising cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is only right that at this critical juncture in our journey out of lockdown, we take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices of the wonderful people who make up our NHS, our key workers, and all those involved in the vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you&#8217;ll find updates on the latest cases and vaccination restrictions, a link to my new online survey and details of what&#8217;s been happening in Parliament and around Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Online Summer Survey – let me know your views:</u></strong></p>



<p>As we head towards Summer Recess in Parliament, I’m about to start delivering my annual report across Amber Valley – please say hello if you see me out and about.</p>



<p>In the report and online, I’m launching a survey to get your views on local issues and recovering from Covid-19, from health appointments to boosting our economy.</p>



<p>Please take just a couple of minutes to complete my Summer Survey and let me know your views <a href="https://www.nigelmillsmp.com/nigels-summer-survey/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing Lockdown Restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 19<sup>th </sup>July 2021, the Government lifted all remaining restrictions on social distancing in England. This represents a further step towards normality as we adjust to living with this virus. Although coronavirus cases are continuing to rise nationally, we have not seen the corresponding rise in hospitalisations and deaths that we would expect given the rates of illness we observed last year. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly clear that the link between infections and serious illness is sufficiently broken to enable this further relaxation of restrictions. However, we must remain careful and exercise our own good judgement to keep transmission in our local community to a minimum.</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Case Rates</u></strong></p>



<p>The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant continues to spread across the country and Public Health England (PHE) is now confident that it has overtaken the Alpha variant to become the most dominant strain of the virus circulating in the UK. The Delta variant is believed to be around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which itself is more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. Encouragingly however, new analysis by PHE shows that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.</p>



<p>As predicted in light of this, cases continue to rise nationally, and this trend is no different locally in Amber Valley. You can find the latest case data <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read?postcode=DE7%206DG">here</a>. We are now ahead of the England average which highlights the need for us to remain careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Vaccines</u></strong></p>



<p>The Country’s vaccine program continues apace with more than 46.2 million people in the UK having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine &#8211; part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.</p>



<p>I was pleased to see the rollout expanded after the Government hit its target of offering a first jab to everyone in the top priority groups &#8211; all those over the age of 50, plus those in high-risk categories by mid-April. With every adult in the UK now having been offered their first dose of the vaccine. A terrific effort, nationally and locally.</p>



<p>As of last Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> July, Amber Valley had successfully given at least one dose of the vaccine to 88% of local adults, with 72.8% having received both jabs. This remains slightly above the average for England which stands at 87.7% of adults having received one jab, and 68% both jabs. These figures are a testament to the exemplary vaccine program here in our constituency.</p>



<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team, and the local NHS to ensure that this area continues to see the full roll out of vaccines.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing of restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>As of Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July, all legal restrictions on social distancing in England have been lifted. This is truly excellent news, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing Amber Valley businesses, organisations, and individuals operating at full capacity without legal restrictions.</p>



<p>The following measures are now in place across England:</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on how many people can meet.</p>



<p>&#8211; 1m-plus rule removed (except in some places like hospitals).</p>



<p>&#8211; Face coverings no longer required by law.</p>



<p>&#8211; Nightclubs can open.</p>



<p>&#8211; Pubs and restaurants no longer table service only.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on guests at weddings and funerals.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on people attending concerts, theatres or sports events.</p>



<p>&#8211; No restrictions on communal worship.</p>



<p>It is important to remember, however, that this easing of restrictions is designed to empower ourselves as individuals to use our common sense to slow the spread of the virus, which is still very present in our communities. Therefore, I implore you to enjoy these new freedoms responsibly.</p>



<p>As ever, to find out more information on what restrictions apply in your area please look <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting our local economy</u></strong></p>



<p>As we try to re-open, it&#8217;s key to support our local economy to bounce back, and provide a boost to local jobs and businesses. Unemployment is Amber Valley is currently at 4.2%, which is below the national average of 5.6% and 150 lower than in May 2021. As the Job Retention Scheme (furlough) starts to wind down, we need to remain cautious, but there are lots of vacancies around and local employers advertising job opportunities, including the Kickstart Scheme to help young people get back into work. I&#8217;ll also look to organise a Job Fair, maybe initially virtually, over the next few months &#8211; please get in touch if you&#8217;d like to be involved in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Borders Bill</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve recently welcomed the Government’s New Plan for Immigration, also known as the Borders Bill, into parliament. This legislation intends to:</p>



<ul><li>Speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals.</li><li>Introduce maximum life sentences for people smugglers.</li><li>Empower the Border Force to do more to stop and seize small boats and search containers for hidden migrants.</li><li>Stop illegal arrivals gaining immediate entry into the asylum system if they have travelled through a safe county (like France).</li><li>Increase the maximum sentence for illegally entering the UK.</li><li>Grant resettled refugees indefinite leave to remain.</li><li>Better integrate refugees who are resettled.</li></ul>



<p>I know constituents want more to be done to reduce illegal immigration. I will, therefore, continue to engage with ministers throughout this Bill’s journey through parliament to ensure the Government delivers on its manifesto commitments of reducing illegal immigration to UK.</p>



<p><strong><u>In Parliament:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament this month, I&#8217;ve been asking questions on travel restrictions, catch-up education and English Votes for English Laws legislation.</p>



<p>During recent questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, I raised the issue on behalf of constituents of families with children under 18 wanting to travel abroad, but who aren&#8217;t eligible for the vaccine as yet. I&#8217;m pleased the Secretary of State agreed to look into this issue, and you can find out more on his answer <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-19b.670.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g680.4">here</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also asked the Secretary of State for Education about catch-up tutoring for school pupils following the pandemic, and you can find the full debate on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-06c.768.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g776.0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, during Business Questions in the House, I asked about the continuation of English Votes for English Laws legislation, as part of a continued fair settlement of devolution across the UK. You can find more on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-06-24b.1011.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1023.2">here</a>&nbsp;and on my Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/nigelmills">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also find more on my recent parliamentary appearances and questions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pid=24965&amp;pop=1#n4">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Solar Farm</u></strong></p>



<p>Locally, I’ve been working with local residents and councillors to help oppose plans to construct a 310-acre solar farm on a vast swathe of green space between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. The solar farm has been proposed by Kronos Solar and is subject to several planning applications across Amber Valley Borough Council and North East Derbyshire District Council. I think this would destroy our local landscape due it&#8217;s scale and extent, so whilst I&#8217;m not against renewable energy or solar panels, I think these applications are inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The applications are still awaiting determination by the councils (likely to be in September) so there&#8217;s still time to comment or lodge any concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find details of the residents&#8217; objection group, and information on the individual applications and how to comment if you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savealfretoncountryside/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council Local Plan consultation &#8211; Have your say!</u></strong></p>



<p>The new administration at the Borough Council has launched a new consultation on the next stage of preparing Amber Valley&#8217;s Local Plan, a development document which will set out and plan future housing growth in the area, and making sure we have the infrastructure improvements to match any new homes. I welcome the planned reduction in the overall number of new homes being proposed, which is part of the consultation. The Council are also consulting on the options for the overall strategy (spatial strategy) of the plan, which include focusing housing growth on the Derby City urban area border, in and around Amber Valley&#8217;s four key towns, or in the wider area and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation on the proposals and headline strategy for the plan so far is open from now until the 30th September 2021. Please do take opportunity to feed in your views to the Council &#8211; I know how strongly residents rightly feel over housing in our area, and so this is the most important chance to have your say on making sure we protect our Green Belt and shaping&nbsp;the future of planning in our area. You can find the consultation and how to submit your views on the proposals <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/alternative-spatial-strategy-options-for-housing-and-economic-growth/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, if there are any street repairs in your area, such as potholes, pavement repairs or broken street lights, you can report these issues and concerns to me quickly and easily&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/street-watch/">here</a> so I can ask for the repairs to be investigated and addressed.</p>

    <title>“Universal Credit uplift should be permanent” says city councillor</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/07/22/universal-credit-uplift-should-be-permanent-says-city-councillor/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In response to a question at July Full Council, the Portfolio Holder for Finance and Resources has called on the Government to retain the £20 a week uplift in Universal Credit&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;highlighting how it supports many low paid working people in Nottingham.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham and in response to the pandemic in April last year the Government introduced an increase in payments of £20 a week. There is growing speculation that the Government will reverse the uplift later this year resulting in increasing difficulty for many people who are already struggling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to a question at Full Council on the issue, Cllr Sam Webster said “Universal Credit supports low paid working people in our city, tens of thousands of children in our city and people who are entitled to support with housing costs or have lost their job during the Covid pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Webster commenting on the
consequences of the £20 a week uplift being reversed warned that “It will often
be felt most acutely by Nottingham children who are growing up in families
where there already isn’t much money around, families who are living in
poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January this year Nottingham City Council passed a motion urging the Government to retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit and urging an extension of the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support. This was followed up by a letter from the Leader of Nottingham City Council to the Chancellor emphasising the importance of the £20 a week uplift. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cllr Webster continued his response by saying “Lower paid and lower skilled working people are much more likely to have lost their job, not be able to work from home, have additional childcare needs, have gone through periods of Covid isolation without receiving pay, have lost hours at work&amp;#8230;.and the list goes on.&amp;nbsp;Reducing Universal Credit now would be big blow to many families who are already struggling to make ends meet.” He also argued that the uplift in Universal Credit should be seen as a litmus test for how seriously the Government is about levelling, saying to not make the uplift permanent would be a case of “levelling down”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cllr Webster ended by saying “In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago it was (and still is) shameful that the poorest people in this country were made to pay the price of mistakes made by the wealthiest. In terms of the policies that our national politicians pursue &amp;#8211; this is one of those markers &amp;#8211; who will The Conservative Government expect to pay for this latest economic and public debt crisis?&amp;nbsp; The message from Labour in Nottingham is crystal clear &amp;#8211; let it not be the poorest families again.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There seems to be a webinar for everything — from cooking an apple pie and setting up your email list to creating a company and making your first million. This form of interaction with the target audience became popular for a good reason. It allows to achieve numerous goals:</p>



<ul><li>Selling products</li><li>Attracting new audience</li><li>Improving engagement</li><li>Building and improving brand awareness</li><li>Creating an image of an expert for yourself or your company</li><li>Distributing content</li></ul>



<p>And that’s we’ve just scratched the surface. Every person who creates a webinar has their own unique goals in mind. This wide array of benefits is what makes webinars such a great way to promote your brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="706" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-164" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-325x211.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-166" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
