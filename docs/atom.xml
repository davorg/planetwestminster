  <summary type="text">Cumbrian MP Tim Farron is demanding the Government to provide emergency financial support for outdoor education centres after ministers told schools not to take their pupils on overnight residential visits.
Last night the Department for Education issued new guidance on the Government's website stating that they "continue to advise against domestic (UK) overnight educational visits" and that they won't review their advice until next February.</summary>

<p>Tim is now urging ministers to follow the Scottish Government in providing a £2m recovery fund for outdoor education centres.</p>
<p>According to trade body UK Outdoors, nearly 3,000 jobs have already been lost and many outdoor education facilities have permanently closed</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"This is a devastating blow for outdoor education centres in Cumbria and across the country.</em></p>
<p><em>"Millions of young people are missing out on these trips which are so beneficial for their confidence and mental health.</em></p>
<p><em>"My worry is by the time the Government does change its advice, many of these centres simply won't be there anymore. That's why I'm urging the UK Government to follow the Scottish Government and introduce a bespoke funding package for outdoor education centres."</em></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2020/11/worcester-mp-urges-caution-as-tiering-system-returns-across-the-country/"><![CDATA[<p>Worcester MP Robin Walker has urged caution as Worcester will move into ‘tier 2’ of the new restrictions come into force next week. The current national restrictions will end on December 2 and the tiering system will return across the country.</p>
<p>It was confirmed today that Worcester will come into the ‘high alert category’ which will see shops, gyms and personal care establishments re-open.</p>
<p>Robin urged people in Worcester to safely show their support for local businesses which have had to close down in the crucial run up to Christmas. Robin has also reinforced the need to comply with the new measures when they come in place to ensure that Worcester can move into the tier one, medium alert category.</p>
<p>Decisions on which area goes into which tier are primarily based on 5 key epidemiological indicators; case detection rates in all age groups, case detection rates in the over-60s, the rate at which cases are rising or falling, positivity rate (the number of positive cases detected as a percentage of tests taken), and pressure on the NHS, including current and projected occupancy.</p>
<p>The indicators are designed to provide a full picture of what is happening with the virus in any area so that suitable action can be taken.</p>
<div class="column">
<div class="letter-content">
<p>Robin welcomes the fact that Local Authorities in Tier 2 areas are being provided with additional funding to make cash grants to businesses that can remain open. These grants are primarily aimed at hospitality, leisure and accommodation businesses and are worth 70 per cent of the value of grants available to closed businesses in Tier 3 areas. He is also pleased to see grants for the self-employed increased from covering 20 per cent of profits to 40 percent, thereby increasing the maximum grant from £1,875 to £3,750.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first review of the tier allocations will take place on December 16, with the potential for areas to move down a tier before Christmas if they are making progress in slowing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Speaking after the announcement of the tiers, Robin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to again thank the people of Worcester for all the sacrifices that they have made this year and once again I urge people to comply with tiering system when it comes into effect so that we can move into Tier 1 as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>“From December the 2nd, businesses across the UK and in Worcester will reopen and most fitness activities will be allowed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased that shops will be able to remain open in Worcester from the 2nd of December, especially coming into Christmas and going forward our testing capacity and start to roll out the vaccines as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>“I know the coming weeks are going to be difficult, but we need to do whatever we can by supporting our local businesses and buying locally, whether that be in person or through click and collect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>ENDS</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-233094" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Support-food-banks-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Support-food-banks-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Support-food-banks-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Support-food-banks-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Support-food-banks-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Support-food-banks.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth in the use of food banks has been a sad trend over the past decade and – frankly – an indictment of ten years of failed Conservative policy, which has seen services cut and support slashed for those most in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as awful of this trend has been, it has been inspiring for me to see the fantastic things that our local food banks do for their communities and the amazing dedication of their volunteers. These food banks – including St Mary’s Haughton Green in Denton and Tameside East in Dukinfield within my constituency – have provided an absolutely vital service to so many people within the community, ensuring that both adults and children are fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been even more important during the Coronavirus crisis, which has seen many lose their jobs or businesses, forcing some people unexpectedly into poverty for the very first times in their lives. Research by one national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has predicted a staggering 61% increase in demand for their food banks over this winter period. At the same time, lockdown restrictions have made it more difficult for food banks (and all charities in fact) to make collections or raise funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may know that I’ve been running Citizen’s Awards to recognise those who have gone above and beyond for others within the Denton and Reddish constituency and I’m very pleased to say that a number of award winners have raised money or collected for our food banks. Additionally, the fantastic campaigning of Marcus Rashford on children’s holiday hunger has really shone a much-needed light on the issue of food poverty. These are encouraging signs that this issue is being taken seriously and we can make real progress on combatting food poverty, but there is still much to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also entering the Christmas period. We don’t yet know what restrictions may or may not be eased this year, but what we do know is that what is a jolly and happy time for many people is also the most difficult time of year for others. Whilst many of us tuck into turkey, Brussels sprouts and pigs in blankets, there are others who are just hoping to have enough to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this Christmas – more than ever – we need to show support for our local food banks, and I’d encourage you all to find out how you might be able to help, whether that’s volunteering or donating.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data revealing the shocking extent of sewage pollution flowing into rivers in South Shropshire show why action is needed to clean up our rivers, says local MP Philip Dunne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Dunne has introduced a Private Member’s Bill to place a duty on water companies to ensure that untreated sewage is not discharged into rivers and other inland waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sewage spilled into South Shropshire rivers for a total of 7,721 hours in 2019, as a result of 72 discharges from water treatment works across the constituency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes spillages from Combined Sewer Overflows in Bridgnorth and Quatford into the River Severn last year 301 times, for a duration 960 hours. The Severn was also affected by spillage into tributary waterways at Broseley for 256 hours through 128 separate spills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sewage entered the River Teme at Ludlow on 181 occasions, for a total duration of 1,768 hours. The River Teme was also affected at Burford, where 150 spillages took place for a total of 1,886 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller rivers were also affected with Borle Brook badly affected at Highley, with 79 spillages for a total of 1,179 hours, while the River Clun was also affected at the town on 56 occasions for a total of 570 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the River Severn and River Worfe have been classified as in ‘poor’ ecological condition under the Water Framework Directive from the Environment Agency, with the Worfe affected by sewage spills 108 times for a total of 1,812 hours last year. The River Rea is classed as in ‘bad’ ecological condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Dunne said the extent of the problem could be even more wide-reaching, given this data has been extracted from what has been admitted publicly by water companies, some of which have been more reluctant than others to acknowledge the true extent of spillage. Although he recognises that local water company Severn Trent Water has been one of the more forthcoming of all the water companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bill will have its Second Reading on 15th January, and Mr Dunne is encouraging people across the country to ask their MP to back his Bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Dunne said: “Strolling along a riverbank in South Shropshire, or looking over a bridge in one of our towns, you might not be aware of the huge problem of sewage spilling into our local rivers. But 7,721 hours of spillage in our local rivers occurred in just the last year alone. In fact I suspect the actual amount of spillage may be higher, as the current system of event  monitoring across the country leaves a lot to be desired. While much of this happens at the same time when it rains, it is equivalent to a spillage happening somewhere in South Shropshire for 88% of the year. Water companies are licensed to spill so there is a release mechanism intended to be used for exceptional storms, but now it has become routine - virtually whenever it rains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this completely unacceptable, and sewage spills need to stop. I am determined to clean up the state of our rivers, not only here in South Shropshire, but across the whole country.  So I am asking the public to check if their MP is backing my Bill, and if not, to ask them why. I am delighted to have support of over 80 MPs so far with broad cross-party interest, but we shall need many more to have a chance of this Bill becoming law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bill already enjoys the support of The Rivers Trust, The Angling Trust, Surfers Against Sewage, Wildlife Trusts, Wildlife &amp; Countryside Link, RSPB, Salmon &amp; Trout Conservation, Freshwater Habitats, Bug Life, Waterkeeper Alliance, London Waterkeeper, Windrush Against Pollution, Sewage Free Swimmers, Blue Marine Foundation, Outdoor Swimming Society, British Canoeing, Royal Lifesaving Society, Marinet UK, and the Institute of Fisheries Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It proposes several other measures, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;improving transparency and monitoring of the impact of spillages on water quality;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;separating surface and foul water drainage systems from new infrastructure and housing development;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;encouraging nature-based solutions for wastewater treatment;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;requiring water meters for all homes being leased, rented or sold from 2025;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;prohibiting use of plastic in flushable products;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;promoting improvements in bathing water standards for inland waters and rivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Dunne added: “I am calling on local councils to check the information which has been published for the first time on the website supporting my campaign, and move a motion in support of my Sewage (Inland Waters) Bill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an easy to navigate map showing the frequency and duration of spills at every water treatment works in England accessible here: &lt;a href="http://www.sas.org.uk/EndSewagePollution-SewageBill"&gt;www.sas.org.uk/EndSewagePollution-SewageBill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Scottish National Investment Bank: An innovative approach to future investment in Scotland</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/scottish-national-investment-bank-an-innovative-approach-to-future-investment-in-scotland/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=scottish-national-investment-bank-an-innovative-approach-to-future-investment-in-scotland" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;The newly launched Scottish National Investment Bank provides an eagerly awaited platform for a more innovative approach to future investment in Scotland. It’s not supposed to operate like other banks; for a start, its shareholders are you and me &amp;#8211; the Scottish people. With a mission to think differently and independently, it’s the champion of innovation and equity. Designed to enable people in Scotland to flourish, increasing productivity and our natural innovation, our new National Investment Bank is also committed to equality of opportunity geographically across Scotland to improve place by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;To achieve this, it will invest its £2 billion starter funding on projects aiming to meet social challenges facing Scotland in the future. This includes supporting the Scottish government’s efforts to tackle the climate emergency, to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045 and to navigate the transition from fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;With its first £12.5 million investment awarded to a new company, M squared, the bank is actively investing as I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;As ever, with opportunity, comes threat and under current constitutional arrangements, the Scottish National Investment Bank will only be able to fully function if the UK Government does not stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;There are two substantial issues challenging progress – that we don’t yet know what is next from Brexit and crucially, decisions around state aid arrangements. In the event of a no-deal Brexit or &amp;#8211; as is more likely &amp;#8211; an insufficient deal, risks to progress around state aid and our economic drivers’ increase further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;State aid rules should not be a barrier to the Scottish National Investment Bank. If we were an independent member state of the EU, we would have the ability to set our state aid parameters within the policy framework, just as other EU nations who run their investment banks have done. It is the decisions of Westminster on Brexit and its infamous Internal Market Bill that threaten our progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;With the UK Ministers delaying dispensation on the Scottish National Investment Bank until the end of 2021, their ability to hamper this venture increases further. Without Treasury dispensation, the bank’s balance will have to be accommodated within Scotland’s overall reserves, limiting opportunities to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;These challenges and constraints further highlight that the current system of government impedes our ability to realise the full potential of our people and economy. To every new policy or venture, there is always another hurdle, another battle with Westminster. There is a better way. As with many of our other policy ambitions, this bank has the potential to inject hope into our communities and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="xmsonormal"&gt;We need to be able to create and deliver policies that meet the needs of our people &amp;#8211; to achieve this; we need to have the control that comes with independence. The Scottish National Investment Bank can be the start of a new, fairer and more responsive economic future for Scotland and our people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

    <title>Three cheers for overseas aid</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2020/11/27/three-cheers-for-overseas-aid/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>I am glad the UK spends money on ships and equipment that go  to assist countries facing flood and tempest. I am in admiration of  our medics and armed forces when they sometimes go to help treat and contain dangerous infectious diseases abroad. I am pleased the UK as one of the leading and richest countries of the world helps alleviate and tackle poverty in the developing nations. </p>



<p>The UK should set out what it can do and what it is good at, and should be generous where need arises and where we have the means to help. I want to see reform of our budgets and our activities in these areas so we achieve more with better value for taxpayers. </p>



<p>I went along with the Conservative leaderships’ support for hitting the 0.7% target of GDP, though I have  misgivings about such targets. I do not think we should commit to spend a  certain proportion of a fluctuating and usually growing number. We should decide on spending on a case by case basis and against our general budget background. We do not pledge to spend a fixed proportion of GDP on health or education or policing, but look at those budgets in the light of needs and costs. I trust the government will now repeal the 0.7% pledge in our law codes.</p>



<p>Labour  will doubtless oppose such a change. They  averaged under 0.4% of GDP on  overseas aid in  their period in government 1997-2010, despite pretending  to support the international commitment to spend around twice as much as they managed. They never explained why during all those years they did not do what now they say we must do. Those who want to see more overseas aid spent might do better to lobby the EU and its member countries who spend together well below the 0.5% the UK is now indicating as a new temporary level. </p>



<p>Last year the UK again spent 0.7% or £15bn on overseas aid. £10bn of this was spent on projects and activities we chose along with the recipient country in so called bilateral aid. The balance of £5bn was spent by our giving the money to the EU and other multinational bodies to spend as they saw fit in so called multilateral aid. As we leave the EU it is a good time to bring our overseas aid spending back in house and decide on how we can best help those in need.  We should also look at the full support we give, which goes wider than the items allowed under international conventions to be called Overseas Aid. Some of our Defence expenditure is aid, being used to help bring peace to strife torn countries and providing assets to tackle disasters. </p>



<p>I want us to identify the areas where we have most expertise and can do most to help. Maybe the UK should specialise in a few areas like the provision of clean water to each home, the provision of primary education to all girls as well as boys in poor countries and the roll out of programmes to tackle infectious diseases. </p>



<p>We should follow certain guidelines. The money should for preference be spent in  the country we are trying to help, using as much local labour and skills as possible. Where we need advanced country inputs these should usually come from people and companies based in  the UK. We should work on  the principle that it is better to teach a hungry person to fish and farm  for themselves rather than sending them food parcels. The aim is to get countries out of poverty, not into dependence. More trade is often of more help than more aid. </p>



<p>It will be great to see us achieve more by concentrating our efforts in areas where we have most to offer, harnessing public and private sectors together, and taking control with more  programmes we run for the benefit of the poorer countries. . </p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/2020/11/26/amber-valley-derbyshire-tier-update-from-the-2nd-december-2020/"><![CDATA[<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

    <title>CADEY committee meets for update on campaign to boost lifesaving defibrillators</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.grahamstuart.com/2020/11/cadey-committee-meets-for-update-on-campaign-to-boost-lifesaving-defibrillators/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The CADEY committee, chaired by Beverley and Holderness MP Graham Stuart, has met virtually for an update on its campaign to increase the number of lifesaving defibrillators across the constituency.</p>
<p>Formed in 2018, CADEY – standing for Community Access Defibrillators East Yorkshire – identified 63 communities without a publicly accessible defibrillator when it was formed. This has since been reduced by more than half by offering match-funding schemes with parish councils, as well as by asking businesses to use community funds to help purchase them.</p>
<p>The committee’s latest meeting on 20th November brought Graham together with representatives from the Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) as well as health and welfare charities the HEY Smile Foundation, Help for Health and NURSE.</p>
<p>With the help of 50% match-funding from NURSE, six new defibrillators are due to be installed in the coming weeks and months, including in South Dalton and Mappleton, while publicly accessible defibrillators in Kilnsea and Rise have now been added to the YAS database so they are able to direct patients to them in an emergency.</p>
<p>Graham said, “So many cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals – 30,000 a year – and only one in every ten people survive. There’s no magic bullet of course, but raising awareness of the importance of CPR and defibrillators can make a massive difference because every minute without treatment reduces someone’s chances of survival by 10%.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted as well that we’ve seen CPR training added to the national curriculum, because some other countries which teach it regularly have almost twice the survival rates.</p>
<p>“Knowing where your nearest defibrillator is and being confident to use it are two simple steps that can save lives.”</p>
<p>Leading charities have raised concerns that survival rates could be getting worse after one-third of British adults said that they didn’t know whether they should be giving CPR during the pandemic, or if it has to be performed by trained clinicians in suitable PPE. Official guidance from the Resuscitation Council recommends placing loose material over the patient’s mouth and nose before performing hands-only CPR.</p>
<p>The CADEY committee is also working up plans to send postcards across Beverley and Holderness, with information about what to do in case of emergency alongside the location of the closest available defibrillator. The committee will be encouraging people to stick these on their fridge, so the information is close to hand in an emergency.</p>
<p>The postcards will also invite people to download the free what3words app, which has given every 3-metre square in the world a unique combination of words. Their system is already used by YAS to quickly identify where to go on call-outs and giving YAS the three words corresponding to your exact location can save paramedics vital minutes to help in the fight to save lives.</p>
<p>The postcards will feature space for people to write in the what3words corresponding to their home address, so that YAS know exactly where to head to and can tell the caller where their closest defibrillator is.</p>

    <title>Isles MP backs staff call to prevent Remote Air Traffic Control</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Isles MP Angus MacNeil is backing calls by Prospect Union to protect island jobs by opposing the centralisation of Air Traffic Control functions to Inverness.</p>



<p>Prospect members in Air Traffic Control at Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) are to be balloted on industrial action over HIAL’s plans to push on with its remote towers project.</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “This is an inevitable consequence of HIAL’s high handed approach to people’s jobs and livelihoods and damaging the island economy by taking critical, well paid jobs out of the area.  It is time now for the Scottish Government to step in.</p>



<p>“HIAL’s answers have not been good enough. Air Traffic Control staff and the public deserve better. The Transport Minister needs to get involved and our Air Traffic Control services need to be kept in Benbecula and Stornoway.”</p>



<p>Prospect have stressed that any industrial action will have no effect on emergency services and if action is taken it will be after the Christmas holiday period.</p>

    <title>Letter from Cllr David Mellen to the PM on COVID Tiers</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2020/11/25/letter-from-cllr-david-mellen-to-the-pm-on-covid-tiers/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Dear Prime Minister,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;Cllr David Mellen&lt;br&gt;Leader, Nottingham City Council&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-34/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I want to send my huge congratulations to staff and students at Ysgol Hendrefelin this week for their accreditation with the prestigious British Council’s International School Award. This award recognises the incredible and innovative work of schools across the UK to connect their pupils to the world through modern languages, classroom exchanges, and connections with young people around the globe. Learning languages is so important – it gives us access to new cultures and ideas and allows us to broaden our understanding of the world.  Well done Ysgol Hendrefelin.</p>
<p>I was pleased to chair a debate in Westminster Hall this week on fuel poverty. This always becomes an issue in the lead up to winter, but this year, there will be an added strain on so many tightened household budgets. One of the major obstacles in tackling fuel poverty is the inefficient nature of our older housing. Poorly insulated properties leak heat and so more energy is needed to keep the house warm. As well as supporting those in fuel poverty in the short-term, we really need a national strategy to not only ensure developers are building energy efficient homes, but also that we are supporting homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient. This will not only contribute to lower household bills, but it will also help us reduce our carbon footprint.  This is an important issue that intersects the economy, social inequality, and the environment, and one which it is vital that we tackle.</p>
<p>This week is Usdaw’s annual Respect for Shopworkers Week which they run as part of their Freedom From Fear campaign which seeks to tackle the rising problem of violence and abuse towards our fabulous frontline retail workers. Our shopworkers have done so much to keep us well stocked and our morale high during this crisis and I am shocked to see the appalling treatment that many of them have experienced. I am pleased to support this campaign and would encourage all constituents to sign <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/328621">Usdaw’s petition</a> to call on the UK Government to enact legislation to create a specific offence of abusing, threatening, or assaulting a retail worker with a penalty that shows that we are serious about stopping these disgusting attacks.</p>
<p>It’s Anti-Bullying Week this week and it’s important to support the campaign. Bullying can have a long-lasting effect on those who experience and witness it, but by working together, by sharing our experiences, and by educating young people, we can reduce bullying. We all have a part to play – parents, teachers, politicians, celebrities, and young people themselves – we can all speak out against bullying and speak up for those experiencing it.</p>
<p>We marked International Men’s Day this week and it’s a chance to make sure men know that reaching out for help with a physical or mental health problem is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength. In 2017, sadly 12,031 men died from prostate cancer, a rise from 11,307 in 2014. It is so important that men go to their GP when something doesn’t seem right – if problems are caught earlier, they are much easier to deal with. In 2018, it is astonishing that 4,903 men took their own lives – that’s 13 men dying every day, making up 3 in 4 of all suicides in the UK. We need to talk more about men’s mental health and make it clear that there is help available for men. Domestic abuse is another area where men have suffered, and evidence shows 1 in 3 people who experience domestic abuse are men.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my work as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <title>We’re halfway there, so well done</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/were-halfway-there-so-well-done/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"/><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"/></div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>As we approach the halfway point of the Government’s nationwide lockdown, I want to thank constituents and businesses for abiding by the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The Government has lost control of the virus, and my first duty is to keep my constituents safe. That is why I voted for the lockdown. Nobody voted for the regulations with anything but a heavy heart. I did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>This period must be used to undertake the transfer of test and trace to local public health departments, including a full resource transfer. In addition, the Government must ensure that the NHS and social care are fully prepared with adequate PPE, as high as possible uptake of flu vaccinations and regular testing regimes.</p>
<p>I have proposed measures to protect the clinically vulnerable and providing ‘supportive shielding’ so that people don’t experience the devastating isolation that happened last time. We must also make sure we have simple, coherent messaging with local community engagement as well as monitoring and enforcement capacity to support people complying during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Local restrictions have had a devastating effect on people living in care homes and their families.  As co-Chair of the APPG on Dementia I have received heart-breaking stories from Oldhamers, unable to visit their loved ones for months on end, and who have seen a marked deterioration in their condition, particularly for those living with dementia.</p>
<p>I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the impact of coronavirus on people living with dementia, their families and carers last week, where I challenged the Minister on these issues. I pressed the Minister to report back to Parliament on her trial of visitor testing which starts on 16<sup>th</sup> November in 30 care homes, with the intention of rolling out testing for visitors across the country in December.  It is essential that family members are able to safely visit their loved ones in care homes, especially as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>I have also been challenging the Government on how they’ve been awarding Covid-related contracts. Billions of pounds of public money has been awarded to private companies often with no experience in delivering medical supplies. The Government’s repeated refusal to come clean about where this public money has left no option but to compel the Government to come clean through the courts. This is why I partnered with Caroline Lucas MP, Layla Moran MP and the Good Law Project in legal action to force the Government to publish details of private covid and PPE related contracts.</p>
<p>Whilst we recognise that at the beginning of the pandemic we needed to move quickly, this does not justify the Government’s wholesale disregard for transparency including the publication of contracts awarded. The Government has now disclosed that at least £17 billion worth of Covid-19 contracts have been awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care since April, with over £4 billion of these contracts being hidden. The transparency gap is therefore growing.</p>
<p>I am pleased that last week the High Court granted our judicial review to challenge the Government’s persistent failure to publish these contracts. The hearing is scheduled for mid-January 2021 and I’ll keep you informed of our progress.</p>
<p>Do look after yourselves and stay safe.</p>

    <title>Emma Joins Advisory Board of the John Mills Institute for Prosperity</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color"&gt;Earlier this month I was delighted to be personally invited by renowned businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist, John Mills to join the advisory board of his new Institute for Prosperity recently. The nine person advisory board is made up of a group of cross-party MPs, former MPs and Peers. All of whom have Ministerial or Shadow Ministerial experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Institute was set up earlier this year by Mr Mills who is also the founder and Chairman of South Shields based consumer goods company JML, which sells high-volume consumer products in the UK and 85 countries worldwide.&amp;nbsp;The Institute’s aim is to increase prosperity, growth and equality by putting a more successful economic future at the heart of British political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Shields, like many towns across the country have been decimated by lack of investment and deindustrialisation and many have been forgotten by successive governments. Growing up I watched this powerful and prosperous industrious town slowly wither and as a result 100’s of skilled jobs, like that of my fathers disappeared too along with much needed investment. So, I am delighted to work alongside John and parliamentary colleagues to do all we can to find a consensus, to provide a platform to bring people with fresh ideas together and to find new solutions to Britain’s economic problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judith tells Government ‘the people of the north will hold you to account’ on rebalancing the economy.</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I took part in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DanJarvisMP&lt;/a&gt; debate on support for the economy in the North. We need a fundamental rebalancing of our economy after Covid. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this Government to account for their promises and their actions. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCcp6jNBhp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCcp6jNBhp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judith Cummins (@JudithCummins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudithCummins/status/1326541226452004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welwyn Hatfield MP and Ex-RAF Serviceman Steve McNamara Remark on Remembrance Sunday 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional remembrance memorial services have halted by the coronavirus pandemic, preventing gatherings around memorials and cenotaphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps believes that this should not lessen our commitment to remembering those who have died in war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting the Hatfield Memorial Garden, Mr Shapps said: “Today cuts very deep inside really because it makes you recall…the ultimate sacrifice that so many have given to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so easy to forget what they went through- the horror of it all- so that we could live in peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve McNamara, an RAF veteran from Welwyn Garden City with grandfathers who fought in both First and Second World Wars, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think every generation has historic, cataclysmic events that define them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this generation, it is probably COVID. It has produced heroes and victims, and I think these will be remembered in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps also spoke of the vital role of the Armed Forces in the battle against the virus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a Remembrance Sunday like no other, as we battle this coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the thing to remember is that a lot of the people that we’re here commemorating and thanking, are actually out there serving right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thousands internationally, but also at home in the battle against the virus- for example in Liverpool, helping with mass-testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps laid a wreath at the Hatfield memorial. He said: “I think in the Armed Forces we have as much to thank today as we ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /divi:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- divi:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why Remembrance Sunday- even remembering it slightly differently than usual is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video of the visit was produced, which you can view below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Financial support for those in the North</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2020/11/04/financial-support-for-those-in-the-north/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It could not be more clear that the North is being treated completely differently to the South. I took the opportunity yesterday to question the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, about what financial support package would be available to businesses and workers going forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior to this lockdown announcement, we had had almost universal calls for an extension to the full furlough scheme in areas with tighter restrictions, which Ministers had rejected for months. Despite that, the Government saw fit to announce a new version of this on Saturday, only hours before the previous furlough was due to be replaced by an inferior scheme for us in the north, as further restrictions were becoming inevitable in many areas. Many people in the north therefore now believe that until workers in the south were to be affected by the national lockdown, they were somehow thought to be worth less. Businesses in Gateshead and elsewhere are desperate for clarity and certainty to help them in planning and so that they know whether and how they can survive. Will the Chief Secretary commit today to publishing details of a comprehensive, ongoing financial support package available to businesses and their workers in areas that will continue to need it, where tiers of restrictions might, sadly, have to continue after 2 December?</p></blockquote>
<p>The full debate can be found at: <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-03a.162.0&amp;s=ian+mearns#g174.0">https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-03a.162.0&amp;s=ian+mearns#g174.0</a></p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>This month sees the end of the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, which was put in place at the start of lockdown to avoid mass job losses. It leaves many people in Bristol South facing a very uncertain future.</p>
<p>I, and my Labour colleagues, have been pushing to see the scheme extended for those hardest hit sectors which are still unable to operate properly due to ongoing restrictions. Disappointingly, the Government chose to ignore the calls from us, from business owners, trade unions, think tanks, the cross-party Treasury Select Committee and some of its own MPs; in doing so, it has let down hundreds of thousands of people working in vulnerable industries such as hospitality, leisure, travel and the arts.</p>
<p>Bristol South does not have lots of large employers which can accommodate mass remote working set up. Families across Bristol South rely on paid work with Bristol Airport and in cafes, bars and restaurants as well as the creative sector. It’s home to lots of small businesses, many of which were struggling before the pandemic hit and this has made things a hundred times harder. I’ve heard from local business owners and self-employed people with heartbreaking stories of their family business, in the community for decades employing local people, suddenly facing financial ruin and closure as a result of this pandemic.</p>
<p>The percentage of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Bristol South has already risen from 3.6% in March to 6.2% this summer, and this is likely to increase further. I’m hearing from lots of people who’ve always worked and have never had to apply for government support before. And it’s hitting women and young people particularly hard. We must act now to avert the biggest jobs crisis of a generation.</p>
<p>The Government announced the launch of a Kickstart scheme to support younger jobseekers in August, but we’re yet to see this in action and there appears to be no job guarantee at the end of it. I welcome the offer of extra paid incentives for businesses taking on new apprentices and would encourage employers in Bristol South to explore this further, but they too will need jobs at the end of their training and, at the moment, there is no guarantee there either.</p>
<p>This piecemeal approach is not enough. We need a national plan for job retention and creation as well as retraining. I will continue lobbying the Government on this and am working on plans for my 2021 jobs and apprenticeships fair to help link local people up with jobs and training opportunities. In the meantime, there is help available locally to support people with job hunting and employability skills, see <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/16/support-for-employers-and-jobseekers/"><strong>here</strong></a> for more details.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/28/opinion-karin-smyth-mp-on-a-rise-in-unemployment-in-bristol-south/" target="_blank">OPINION: Karin Smyth MP on a rise in unemployment in Bristol South</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Garforth Station – step free access ready for planning permission.</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.alecshelbrooke.co.uk/garforth-railway-station-step-free-access-ready-planning-permission/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Network Rail is preparing the final stages of delivering step-free access at Garforth Railway Station, it has been announced. </p>
<p>Alec had been campaigning for new step-free access at Garforth for over a decade before finally securing funds direct from the Department for Transport. Alec will continue to work closely, cross-party, with Garforth’s Independent Councillors to represent the views of residents through the planning process. </p>
<p>Announcing the scheme in 2014, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “After years of false starts and broken promises under Labour, it is a testament to the local Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke’s persistent campaigning that I can announce that this scheme is finally happening for the people of Garforth”.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Alec has been in regular contact with Transport officials pushing for firmer plans and no further delays. He also raised the matter several times in the House of Commons Chamber. </p>
<p>But today it has been announced that the final stage before construction is now underway.</p>
<p>Alec said: “Today I’m delighted that Network Rail has formalised a plan with four options for stakeholders to choose from before the submission of a full planning application to Leeds City Council. It is my hope that Leeds City Council can deal with the application swiftly to avoid no further delays”.</p>
<p>“I have been campaigning for step-free access at Garforth Station for many years. We had an original plan submitted but this then incurred unnecessary delays along the way but I have been committed to providing disabled people and pushchair users with the same access to travel as everyone else – and delivering step-free access at Garforth station will help thousands more people travel easily and without additional cost, time or stress”.</p>
<p>Previously, Garforth resident Mrs Morris said: “We’ve waited far too long for disabled access at Garforth. The elderly, disabled and those with pushchairs have not been able to use the station so we’re extremely grateful to Alec for fighting alongside us to deliver this disabled access”. </p>
<p>The Government’s Access for All programme was first launched in 2006 and has delivered more than 200 accessible routes into selected stations so far.</p>
<p>A further 1,500 stations have received smaller scale improvements such as accessible toilets, platform humps to reduce stepping distances and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment.</p>
