<p>Tim encouraged ministers to look at a proposal drawn up by Cumbrian charity Brathay about bringing outdoor education professionals to come into schools to re-engage children with learning and support their mental health.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"I've raised with the Prime Minister directly the issue of the Government directly commissioning outdoor education centres, of which there are dozens in Cumbria which are excellent, to make use of their skills and talents to help re-engage young people with a love of learning.</em></p>
<p><em>"Would he engage with me and with Brathay, the charity in my constituency that has written the draft proposal to see if we can make that a reality in schools right across the country, not just in Cumbria?"</em></p>
<p>In response, the Minister for Schools Nick Gibb said: <em>"We share the honourable gentleman's ambitions.</em></p>
<p><em>"These outdoor education centres are wonderful places, no more wonderful than in the Lake District where he represents.</em></p>
<p><em>"I'd be very happy to discuss these issues with him further."</em></p>

    <title>Covid mortality rate for Sikhs worsened between the first and second wave </title>

          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP has called on the Government to urgently address health disparities between religious groups after new Covid data shows growing divergence.  </p>
<p>The latest ONS data emphasises the alarming Covid mortality rates among Sikhs, Hindus, Jews and Muslims compared to Christians and people of no faith. </p>
<p>Even more worryingly, this data shows that the Covid mortality rate for Sikhs and Muslims compared to Christians has worsened between the first and second wave. For Sikh men, the age-adjusted risk increased from 1.3 times to that of Christians, to 1.7 times. </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “Given the great pain experienced by the Sikh community during the worst of the first wave last year, it is extremely disturbing to see that not only has the work done on health disparities failed to keep up with the problem, it’s gone backwards” </p>
<p>“We know that structural inequalities stretch through every aspect of life and have a part to play in the enormous differences we have seen between different ethnic groups. However, these inequalities cannot be explained by ethnicity alone, and this new data paints a complex picture.  </p>
<p>“I have written to the equalities minister to ask that the lack of routine data collected on Sikhs is addressed. Currently, the ONS advises public bodies to only use the existing ethnic categories in the census to deliver public services. This excludes information for groups including Sikhs and Jews. Given the fact that this new information on Covid mortality rates shows stark differences between majority Asian religious groups, it seems increasingly misguided to ignore these factors. </p>
<p>“Better data and knowledge is integral in addressing disparities, especially when as it stands routine data collection for Sikhs does not exist. Public bodies must have better information on the communities they serve in order to address these shocking health inequalities.” </p>
<p>Dr Sukdev Singh, a resident in Edgbaston constituency, not only sadly lost a loved one to Covid but is also Chair of the Sikh Doctor’s Association and has had to support patients and families throughout the pandemic.  </p>
<p>He commented, “It is really concerning to see inequalities seemingly grow between Sikh people and those from other backgrounds. I’ve seen first-hand how devastating this virus has been to my family and my community. It’s disappointing that the Government hasn’t done more to protect those that are being the worst affected by the pandemic, particularly given the national debate on equality that was widely publicised following the first wave. </p>
<p>“The Government now needs to step up and support those who are worse affected so that we can recover from this crisis. But before these inequalities can be put remedied, the Government needs to start with understanding exactly how many people are from a Sikh ethnic background so that the right resource and funding can be sent to those communities.” </p>
<p>To read the letter from Preet Kaur Gill MP to the equalities minister, where she asks for an explanation on the steps being taken to ensure the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Sikhs is explained and in turn addressed with future monitoring of public service provision, please visit: <a href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-responds-news-covid-death-inequalities-worsened-between-waves" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-responds-news-covid-death-inequalities-worsened-between-waves</a> </p>

There is a reason!

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Telecoms firm Openreach, the offshoot of BT working to install fibre broadband across the UK, have announced that thousands more premises in Beverley and Holderness are set to benefit from being connected to new, ultrafast full-fibre broadband, capable of delivering speeds upwards of ten times faster than before.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2,895 premises in Beverley and Holderness are to be included in Openreach’s expansion, which will deliver full-fibre broadband to at least 3 million more homes and businesses in some of the UK’s hardest-to-reach rural communities. All in all, Openreach will be connecting 25 million properties by an earlier deadline of December 2026, helping to meet the Government’s commitment to deliver gigabit-capable broadband to 85% of the UK by 2025.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The news has been welcomed by Beverley and Holderness MP Graham Stuart, who has been campaigning for his constituents to benefit from better internet connection, and encouraging residents suffering from poor broadband to contact his office in order to encourage new builds from Openreach and KCOM.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The local MP said, “Delivering better broadband is all the more crucial for people and businesses in my constituency as we recover from the effects of the pandemic.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“Covid restrictions have also shown us that we can benefit from better remote access to work and education, and research shows that Openreach’s national rollout could allow more than 1 million more people to access or return to employment, particularly older workers or those with caring responsibilities.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“It could also boost the UK economy by up to £59 billion, with particular benefits for rural communities like ours, and could cut carbon emissions as fewer people travel for meetings.”</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Alongside the expanded rollout’s benefits for consumers, Openreach have announced that it will create a total of 7,000 new jobs across the supply chain, with recruitment for the first 1,000 of these roles already beginning. Since 2017, 9,000 apprenticeship jobs have been created by Openreach’s national rollout.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The news follows Graham Stuart’s recent meeting with KCOM CEO Dale Raneberg, where plans to bring the telecoms firm’s ultrafast ‘Lightstream’ broadband to “sluggish” parts of the MP’s constituency were discussed.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham added, “I want my constituency to benefit from better broadband sooner rather than later, which is why I’m encouraging residents interested in improving their internet speeds to get in touch with me directly, so I can see if anything can be done.”</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">At the beginning of June Transport for London reached an agreement with the Government which extends financial support for services until December 2021. The additional £1.08 billion of base funding means that TfL will be able to:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Continue to <strong>attract customers back </strong>and <strong>support the recovery of London;</strong></li>
                    <li>Advance with the <strong>completion of major projects</strong> such as the Elizabeth line, Northern line extension, expansion of the London Overground to Barking Riverside, upgrading signalling on the Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines, and the rebuild of Bank station;</li>
                    <li>Continue with innovative and creative schemes to <strong>decarbonise transport and to clean up London’s air quality</strong> through the expansion of ULEZ, further electrifying the bus fleet, promoting active travel and improving road safety</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>London’s Transport Commissioner Andy Byford said:</strong>
                <em>“The pandemic – during which our staff have worked so magnificently to keep London moving – has shown our financial model, with such a disproportionate reliance on fare revenue, to be not fit for purpose…..</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>“….. The conditions placed on us by the Government agreement and the amount of funding we will receive means we need to find a further £900m of savings or new income this year compared to our approved Budget and on top of the £730m of savings already assumed in our Business Plan.”</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The Government has explicitly required TfL to deliver at least an additional £300m in savings and/or new income within this financial year. But even with the additional funding there is a funding shortfall which means TfL will need to find nearer £900m in savings and/or new income.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <strong>Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: </strong>
                <em>“It’s important to remember that TfL only needs emergency funding from the Government because its income from fares dropped by up to 90 per cent because Londoners followed the rules by staying at home and avoiding public transport during the lockdown.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>“This short-term settlement is yet another sticking plaster so I will seek to work with the Government over the months ahead to agree a longer-term funding deal for TfL that is both fair and right for Londoners and the whole country.”</em>

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has today backed a campaign calling on the Government to rethink its pandemic recovery measures for children and young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two separate letters to the Prime Minister, coordinated by Fair Education Alliance and the National Children’s Bureau, and signed by over 240 leaders from across business, education and the charity sectors, campaigners have again urged the Government to invest in their stated intention of levelling up and show real ambition for the recovery for children and young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter and the campaign follow the recent resignation of the Government&amp;#8217;s education recovery commissioner Sir Kevan Collins after ministers allocated just £1.4 billion in funding for the next phase of their catch up plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir Kevan Collins had called for around £15 billion to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic. In his resignation letter, Sir Collins wrote that the government&amp;#8217;s funding measures fell &amp;#8216;far short of what is needed&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed £1.4 billion equates to around £50 per pupil, which pales in comparison to the £1,600 and £2,500 per pupil allocated by the United States and the Netherlands respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government loves to talk the talk about levelling up, but they have yet to show that they are serious about it. You simply cannot level up the country or &amp;#8216;build back better&amp;#8217; without funding the futures of babies, children and young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to rethink these funding proposals. The childhoods and futures of young people have been massively impacted by the pandemic, and repairing them cannot be done on the cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am therefore proud to be supporting the National Children&amp;#8217;s Bureau and the various charities, organisations and business leaders who have called for a proper funding plan for our young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.walker4worcester.com/2021/06/worcester-residents-will-benefit-as-parliamentary-constituency-boundaries-remain-unchanged/"><![CDATA[<p>A major review of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England have recommended no change to the boundary of the Worcester constituency. The proposals will lead to some constituencies undergoing major change and some will be abolished altogether, but Worcester MP Robin Walker believes the continuity will benefit Worcester residents.</p>
<p>The recommendations published this week follows extensive research by the Boundary Commission for England, an impartial body responsible for recommending on boundary changes independent of political or parliamentary influence. Boundary reviews take place at regular intervals to account for population changes which lead to varying constituency sizes. Previous proposals involved reducing the  number of Members of Parliament to 600, although this plan was dropped due to the additional workload created for MPs by Brexit.</p>
<p>The initial proposals will see England gain 10 seats, though the West Midlands will lose two. Minor changes will take place in Worcestershire, with no change to the name or boundaries of the Worcester constituency. Their first report will now be open to consultation where members of the public can share their view of the proposals.</p>
<p>Worcester MP Robin Walker was elected in 2010. He said:</p>
<p>“I have spent the last 11 years working to improve Worcester and the lives of people who live here and the current boundary proposals allow me to continue doing that. Despite being the most politically challenging seat for us in Worcestershire I am proud to have increased my vote share at every election since 2010, and I will continue working to push that further.</p>
<p>“Many people recognise that meaningful change can take years to achieve and many years of hard work have recently paid off recently as we have received a major investment into our high street, £15 million for the A&amp;E at Worcester Royal and, of course, today’s incredible announcement of nearly £20 million to transform key Worcester town centre sites. I am working on a number of other key campaigns including better rail services for Worcester and better education facilities for young people in Worcester.</p>
<p>“In addition to that, I have an established team who have spent years getting to know residents, key issues and incredible community groups who I work with on a day to day basis as the MP for Worcester. I have good working relationships with officers and councillors across the political spectrum at Worcester City Council and am glad we will be able to continue working together.</p>
<p>”It is worth noting that these proposals are still only drafts but I can say that I fully support the proposals and believe they will benefit Worcester residents.”</p>
<p>The review will make its final report in 2023 and the boundaries will come into force for the subsequent election. Any resident wishing to make a comment about the boundaries can do so at <a href="https://www.bcereviews.org.uk/">https://www.bcereviews.org.uk/</a>.</p>

    <title>Carers Week</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/06/carers-week/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Carers have gone to extraordinary lengths over the past year to look after and support those they care for, with many caring around the clock often without any breaks. This has come at a huge personal cost, and left many exhausted, feeling burnt-out and increasingly worried about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many carers are worried about their ability to continue to care without access to more support and the opportunity to take meaningful breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carers UK and the other charities supporting Carers Week 2021 are calling on the UK Government to urgently provide an additional £1.2 billion of funding for carers’ breaks, so all carers providing significant hours of care can take a break. Specifically, they are calling for a £50 a week increase in personal budgets in England, and additional funding for the devolved administrations, which could be used flexibly by carers for essential breaks to enable them to continue caring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Recovery is underway</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/06/09/recovery-is-underway/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;       With Brexit behind us and Covid calmed by a comprehensive vaccination programme  which most people welcomed, the U.K. economy is set to grow quickly from here. The U.K. is forecast by international bodies to grow faster this year than the EU. Sterling has risen against the dollar, the Euro and the yen following our exit from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        The U.K. authorities have provided a much smaller monetary and fiscal stimulus than the USA relative to the size of the economy. Money growth has been running at half the US level. The Treasury in the U.K. is planning big cuts in the deficit in future years whilst the US President is planning two more $2trillion packages of extra  spending. The Congress may water that down, as some are becoming alarmed by the scale and duration of the planned debt build up and by the inflationary forces unleashed by  the twin stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.K. the Bank of England needs to avoid premature tightening before recovery is well set. The Treasury needs to speed up ending the special expenditures on companies to cushion the blows of anti pandemic policy, whilst getting us back to work promptly from June 21. Furlough needs to end. Many of the jobs will be there again. Where jobs are lost there will be plenty of new job opportunities as the whole economy opens up and employers seek people to get things done and the orders dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already too many shortages needing more recruitment and more investment. We are short of cement and semiconductors, of HGV drivers and of chefs, of electricity capacity and of home grown fruit and vegetables. I have been asking Ministers to work with business to tackle these shortages urgently, to cut inflationary pressures and create more better paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of opportunities for business creation and expansion as the U.K. embarks on its most rapid and substantial recovery ever recorded. Government needs to make sure the public sector responds by cutting tax rates, granting necessary permissions, negotiating good trade deals and spending its budgets wisely using U.K. suppliers wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>We should roll out open banking to open everything, setting the new global standards for simple, safe data sharing in future and establishing a strong digital image of a new post-Brexit global Britain.</p>



<p>When was the last time you switched to a different bank? This week? This decade? Ever?</p>



<p>For most of us, no matter how much we may grumble about unexpected account fees or lousy foreign currency rates, the answer is ‘never’. And that’s not so bad if we’re broadly happy with what we’re getting. For lots of us, life is too short to spend time worrying about a service that’s fairly trouble free, and which lets you manage your finances from your phone wherever you are.</p>



<p>But sometimes it really isn’t OK. If you want a better deal from your bank but whoever has your current account won’t play ball or wants to charge a small fortune, you’ll want to shop around. And that’s where the UK is sitting on a hidden gem. It’s called open banking, and it means you or I can ask our bank to send any of our financial details to a competitor or a financial advisor, to see if they can find us a better deal.</p>



<p>It’s simple and secure, and it upends the balance of power between banks and their customers. Gone are the days of putting on a suit and tie to impress the bank manager; they know they can’t take anyone who uses open banking for granted anymore, because it’s suddenly so easy for you or me to see if we’re being quietly ripped off, and to take our business elsewhere whenever we want.</p>

Here’s my comment in full: “Time and again, the weight of Ofcom rules about coronavirus coverage upon broadcasters’ legal departments has been explained to me by people with direct experience. “While the actual rulings made appear entirely reasonable, we can only speculate on the extent to which risk aversion within the main broadcasters prevented serious broadcast journalists from applying proper scrutiny to policy.

    <title>Christina Rees MP welcomes phased move to alert level one in Wales</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><span class="s3">Christina Rees, MP for Neath, has welcomed the news confirmed by the First Minister that Wales will begin a phased move to alert level one from Monday. This means up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors and large organised outdoor activities will be able to take place, such as music events and sporting activities.  Additionally, from Monday the size of extended households can increase to up to three households, </span><span class="s3">and </span><span class="s3">a </span><span class="s3">further single adult </span><span class="s3">household </span><span class="s3">is </span><span class="s3">also </span><span class="s3">able to join. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3">Ahead of June 21, Ministers will review the public health situation again and determine whether indoor events can restart from this date.  This two-stage approach will enable more people to be vaccinated and receive both doses before the resuming of indoor events, in light of concerns surrounding the spread of the delta variant of the virus. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3">The full list of changes to regulations from Monday 7 June, and the changes to be considered later in the month can be found here: </span><a href="https://gov.wales/first-minister-confirms-phased-move-alert-level-one"><span class="s4">https://gov.wales/first-minister-confirms-phased-move-alert-level-one</span></a><span class="s3">. </span></p>
<p><span class="s5">Christina Rees, MP for Neath, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">“It is brilliant news that from Monday we can begin the phased move to alert level one in Wales, and enjoy this fabulous summer weather as outdoor events restart.  </span></p>
<p><span class="s3">“It’s really important that we continue to take steps to protect ourselves in light of the new delta variant of the virus, but rates across Wales remain low and the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out at the quickest rate in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="s3">“This phased moved to alert level one wouldn’t be possible without the efforts of people in Neath and across Wales in following the rules to keep each other safe and stop the spread, so thank you and please do take up your vaccine when offered.”</span></p>

<p>Mr Shapps attended a clean-up at the front of the station, helping clean the area of litter, as part of the ‘Great British Spring Clean- organised by Keep Britain Tidy.</p>
<p>At the station Mr Shapps met with Network Rail and station staff, donning protective gloves and a litter picker.</p>
<p>Of the visit, Mr Shapps said: “I’ve challenged Network Rail to clean up the network as much as possible before people start coming back, as we hope, get to the next stage of the unlock.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really important to make people feel more confident about being on the railway. I’m a big believer that if people find that the environment around them is clean, they feel happier and healthier. It helps people’s mental health [and] also helps with physical health as well.</p>
<p>“The Great British Spring Clean is a fantastic initiative, and I’m incredibly happy to be able to support it.”</p>
<p>Paul Rutter, Chief Environment and Sustainability Officer for Network Rail said: “So far, the local team have cleared 500 bags- nearly 5 tonnes rubbish- in the local area between Hatfield and Brookmans Park. Now we’re going to continue through to Finsbury Park and closer to London.</p>
<p>“[We are doing this] not just to make it look better, but also safer for employees and the travelling public.”</p>
<p>The Spring Clean runs until the 13<sup>th</sup> June. So far over 160,000 volunteers have pledged to tidy over 1 million miles of roads, rivers, beaches, and countryside.</p>
<p>Details about the campaign can be found here: <a href="http://www.keepbritaintidy.org">www.keepbritaintidy.org</a></p>

&lt;p&gt;SNP MP Angus MacNeil has met with Transport Scotland auditors to discuss the proposals that HIAL have to remove jobs from the islands to centralise in Inverness, which has an extra cost to the public purse of £2 million each and every year going forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting Angus MacNeil said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I had a fruitful discussion with Transport Scotland Auditors today to understand what role they will play in this process. They will audit the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland&amp;#8217;s costs of HIAL’s project, but they cannot intervene as such. They are referees rather than active players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time I have met auditors about government expenditure. This shows how concerned I am about the obvious waste of public money coming down the track.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“One thing I was anxious to impress was that we don’t want a result on this afterwards which says that this is going to cost an awful lot more, once the jobs have been removed from the islands and HIAL have completed community vandalism in the islands. Hopefully, common sense will prevail and the cheaper options that have been put forward by air traffic controllers themselves and the union Prospect, will be looked at as options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hopefully, this is something the Transport Minister, Graeme Day, will look at. It would be a great feather in his cap if he can save the government £2 million each and every year. It would also reassure the communities. We don&amp;#8217;t want to see something which is technically questionable, which might cause staff turnover, and which has no legislative basis from the UK Government, yet will cause community damage and a cost to the government. That is at least five good reasons why this should not be going ahead.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re: Award of Elite Academy licenses for 2022-2027&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am concerned at the recent announcement from the Rugby Football League (RFL) on the award of Elite Academy licences for 2022-27.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach taken and the outcome would appear to represent a reduction in opportunity in the community heartlands of the sport and a concentration predominantly in the hands of leading Super League clubs.&amp;nbsp;It has also thrown up some worrying outcomes&amp;nbsp;and raises a number of questions about its objectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chair of the decision making panel, Air Commodore Dean Andrew OBE stated afterwards that: “We did not work to award a set number of licences”. This is clearly not the case and&amp;nbsp;is at&amp;nbsp;odds with the RFL statement&amp;nbsp;that there was “an agreement that a maximum of 12 licences should be awarded – up to nine in ‘Core Affinity Areas’, up to two in ‘Emerging Affinity Areas’, and up to one in France.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is this&amp;nbsp;latter part&amp;nbsp;gives rise to concerns that this was about quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and potential and that crucially, deep roots into the community game may have had little weight in the consideration. I find it worrying that such links to the grass roots of the sport appear&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have been set aside.&amp;nbsp; It is, after all, the affinity of our communities for the sport and the part it plays in the life of towns and cities across the north that is the beating heart of the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;disconnect&amp;nbsp;appears most starkly illustrated by the&amp;nbsp;decision not to award an Elite Academy licence to Bradford Bulls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Bulls Academy has been&amp;nbsp;productive and respected&amp;nbsp;for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bradford Bulls is a rooted in the communities of Bradford, the people and the fans. The club sits at the apex of a vibrant local community rugby league structure, particularly in South Bradford. It acts as a powerful incentive and objective for young local players starting out in the sport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RFL’s decision endangers those deep social roots in an area with a huge affinity for the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also find it concerning that the club indicate that they have not had an explanation of the reasons that their application was unsuccessful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate a clear explanation and rationale for the approach taken for developing the&amp;nbsp;Elite&amp;nbsp;Academy&amp;nbsp;model, how this fits with developing players from the community game, and why Bradford’s well established and productive academy program was unsuccessful in that context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your consideration of these matters. I look forward to your reply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><b>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, criticises the Government’s decision allow billions to leave the country in unpaid tax</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has criticised the Government’s decision not to back a global minimum corporation tax on Monday. The proposed minimum corporation tax rate of 15% would have applied across the world. This multilateral agreement is intended to reduce tax avoidance by huge corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill on Monday, urging the Government to support the US proposals. Karin Smyth, voted in favour of the amendment, but the entire Conservative Party voted to reject it. The UK is now the only G7 country not to back a global minimum corporation tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals would introduce a minimum global corporation tax rate starting at 15%, and analysis by Tax Justice UK suggests that a global minimum corporation tax would generate billions a year. This could be used to inject funding into the NHS and support vital public services. </span></p>
<p><b>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is deeply disappointing that the UK is the only G7 country who has failed to support the proposals for a global corporation tax, a move that would protect British businesses and ensure billions remain in the UK economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is more important than ever that the Government prioritises job creation and economic growth. Yet the Government has failed to deliver a financial plan to help people in Bristol South back into work or to help local businesses that are struggling, and now they have rejected an amendment which could help the UK to tackle the economic challenges left in the wake of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Government’s Finance Bill has failed the people of Bristol South. It has no plan to deal with the ongoing costs from the Covid-19 pandemic and has ensured that public services are in desperate need of funding. The Chancellor’s Budget revealed that NHS England core resource spending would be reduced from £147.7 million to £139.1 million in the next year. Yet he refuses to back a plan that would secure £13.5bn a year for the Treasury.”</span></p>

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-34/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about the changes next week to the lockdown rules, as well as on a couple of other local issues.</p>
<p>It is worth saying that although many of the rules on what you can and cannot do will change on 17 May, other restrictions do remain in place.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is the guidance from 17 May:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>You should continue to work from home if you can. When travelling within the UK, you should aim to do so safely and plan your journey in advance.</em></p>
<p><em>You should <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/">get a test</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a> if you have COVID-19 symptoms.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Gathering limits will be eased. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 30 people and indoor gatherings will be limited to 6 people or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>New guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-friends-and-family-covid-19">meeting friends and family</a>will emphasise personal responsibility rather than government rules. Instead of instructing you to stay 2m apart from anyone you don’t live with, you will be encouraged to exercise caution and consider the guidance on risks associated with COVID-19 and actions you can take to help keep you and your loved ones safe. Remember that the risks of close contact may be greater for some people than others and in some settings and circumstances, there will be specific guidance that you will need to follow even when you are with friends and family.</em></li>
<li><em>Indoor entertainment and attractions such as cinemas, theatres, concert halls, bowling alleys, casinos, amusement arcades, museums and children’s indoor play areas will be permitted to open with COVID-secure measures in place.</em></li>
<li><em>People will be able to attend indoor and outdoor events, including live performances, sporting events and business events. Attendance at these events will be capped according to venue type, and attendees should follow the COVID-secure measures set out by those venues.</em></li>
<li><em>Indoor hospitality venues such as restaurants, pubs, bars and cafes can reopen.</em></li>
<li><em>Organised indoor sport will be able to take place for all (this includes gym classes). This must be organised by a business, charity or public body and the organiser must take reasonable measures to reduce the risk of transmission.</em></li>
<li><em>All holiday accommodation will be open (including hotels and B&amp;Bs). This can be used by groups of up to 6 or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</em></li>
<li><em>Funeral attendance will no longer be limited to 30 people, but will be determined by how many people the COVID-secure venue can safely accommodate with social distancing. Limits at weddings, wakes and other commemorative events will be increased to 30 people. Other significant life events, such as bar/bat mitzvahs and christenings, will also be able to take place with 30 people.</em></li>
<li><em>The rules for care home residents visiting out and receiving visitors will change, allowing up to five named visitors (two at any one time), provided visitors test negative for COVID-19.</em></li>
<li><em>All higher education students will be able to access in-person teaching.</em></li>
<li><em>Support groups and parent and child group gathering limits will increase to 30 people (not including under 5s)</em></li>
<li><em>There will no longer be a legal restriction or permitted reason required to travel internationally. There will be a traffic light system for international travel, and you must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">rules when returning to England depending on whether you return from a red, amber or green list country</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions feel free to contact me, though I cannot promise to have all the answers.</p>
<h2>Chalk Pit Epsom</h2>
<p>In my last update I mentioned the issue of the current use of the Chalk Pit in Epsom. I am pleased to say that since then the Environment Agency have stepped up their monitoring and rule enforcement at the site. They have already issued a number of breach notices against the users of the site, and have begun the processes to take stronger action if the problems continue. Those problems have not all gone away yet, though, and I am keeping in contact with local residents and the Environment Agency team to make sure that improvement action continues. I will also continue to press the County to reject the retrospective planning application for the current use.</p>
<h2>Volunteering</h2>
<p>I know that many of you offered to help the voluntary sector during the lockdowns over the past year, and in fact that there were more offers of help than were needed. But if you are still a would-be volunteer, a local charity, Surrey Care Trust is recruiting volunteer mentors. Mentoring is a simple but effective way for a person to give their support to someone who is going through a tough time or needs encouragement to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Surrey Care Trust volunteer mentors are people from the local community who give their time to help young people aged 11-18 and/or families with children aged 5-19, who are struggling to cope with their feelings and may be self-harming, are being bullied at school or are affected by relationship breakdown or domestic abuse at home. With the support of their mentors the young people feel better about themselves, cope better at school, and achieve a goals like going to college or improve relationships and family life at home.</p>
<p>Training for the volunteers and the service are all provided free of charge.</p>
<p>If you are interested in finding out more details are at <a href="http://www.surreycaretrust.org.uk">www.surreycaretrust.org.uk</a></p>
<p>I hope that you are able to enjoy a good summer as the lockdown restrictions ease.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus &#8211; support for local businesses &amp; high streets:</span></strong></p>
<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
