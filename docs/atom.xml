    <title>Time to unlock</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I understand the caution of advisers specialising in controlling CV 19. For them there may indeed be a mutant virus around the corner that beats the vaccine, or a new variant that spreads faster. The task of government is to weigh that advice in the balance with the advice coming from people wanting to re open their businesses, get back to work, have a less restricted social and family life who think the current restrictions have gone on long enough.</p>
<p>Earlier in the pandemic debates I suggested  a range of measures to help keep people as safe as possible whilst locking down less of the economy. Some were adopted. The basis of the whole package was the principle of helping all elderly and medically vulnerable people to stay away from others who might be a centre of infection whilst allowing others unlikely to get a serious version of the disease more freedom if they wished. It was important to make it as easy as possible for those isolating to get deliveries of the things they needed from phone or on line orders, and for them  to keep in touch by phone or zoom or social media.  The measures adopted anyway had to allow a large minority freedom to work to keep the rest of us supplied with food and water, power and broadband. It also had to allow all of us the choice to go to food shops and to take some exercise. As the official figures for cases and deaths built up around the world there was no simple relationship between length and severity of lockdown and death rates. Countries like Belgium and Hungary with lockdown policies suffered worse than others not taking so many measures.</p>
<p>The UK government did well in early identification of vaccines to back, offering cash and orders to companies that seemed likely to develop and test a successful vaccine. It also took up the idea of testing existing drugs for their efficacy in treating the disease to cut death rates for those infected. I also urged more work on air flows and air extraction to make public venues safer, and better infection control in  health establishments.</p>
<p>Yesterday the government announced a continuation of measures for another four weeks. This will harm a range of businesses still locked down, and continue to impede other businesses operating well below  normal capacity thanks to social distancing rules. I urge them to review this decision as soon as new data becomes available. It appears that the vaccines are very effective, and that practically everyone vulnerable to bad version of the disease has now had a vaccine. I favour letting people make more of their own decisions about how much risk they are willing to run in their lives. If someone still has a fear of this virus then of course the employer, the family and the community should be sympathetic and help them to do as much as possible without social contact. For others who are at very little risk of a bad version of the disease, let them make more of their own choices.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This week (14-20 June 2021) is the first ever <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/npto/pages/7493/attachments/original/1622556836/GR_Renters'_rights_awareness_week_list_of_events.pdf?1622556836"><strong>Renters’ Rights Awareness Week</strong></a> and Generation Rent have organised a number of <a href="https://www.generationrent.org/Events"><strong>online events</strong></a> in conjunction with trade unions such as the GMB, Community and Unison and the week itself is funded by The Barrow Cadbury Trust.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Whether you’re new to renting, having problems with your landlord, or just feel you need a refreshment on your rights, these free online events are the perfect fit for you. At each event you’ll get the latest renters’ rights information, be able to ask questions and share your renting experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> <em>“More and more people are relying on the private rented sector, and it is crucial that tenants are aware of their rights, particularly when faced with rogue landlords. Organisations like Generation Rent offer an invaluable source of information to ensure that renters know their rights and what they are entitled to.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                <em>“With a high number of my constituents across Dagenham and Rainham living in privately rented accommodation I hope many will take the time to attend some of the events this week. There are some very knowledgeable speakers throughout the week and their advice could make all the difference to those facing a complex housing situation.”</em>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Generation Rent’s recent renter survey showed only 7% of private renters were confident about their rights as a tenant. Similarly, some 19.3% admitted they knew very little about the rights they do have. One in eight private rented homes in England are considered unsafe. Overcrowding and poor housing conditions are significant safety concerns, which can affect private renters’ health, safety and wellbeing. These statistics are worrying when we consider that in terms of security, cost and quality, the situation is far worse for private renters as compared with those in social housing or in owner-occupation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Many private renters’ find it hard to know exactly where they stand if they face difficulties. This week’s events will be an important source of information, support and advice for many. Find out more and register below.</p>

  <summary type="text">South Lakes MP has spearheaded a letter signed by over 60 MPs, heads of medical colleges and leading oncologists, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent tens of thousands of needless cancer deaths.
It comes as the latest figures from NHS England reveal that in March just 52% of cancer patients in the Morecambe Bay CCG area started their treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral - the second lowest rate in the country.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>South Lakes MP has spearheaded a letter signed by over 60 MPs, heads of medical colleges and leading oncologists, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent tens of thousands of needless cancer deaths.</p>
<p>It comes as the latest figures from NHS England reveal that in March just 52% of cancer patients in the Morecambe Bay CCG area started their treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral - the second lowest rate in the country.</p>
<p>Signed by chairs of All-Party Parliamentary Groups, former cabinet ministers and a former cancer minister, the letter warns that "without urgent action we face a second devastating health crisis as the Covid wards empty and the cancer wards fill."</p>
<p>It calls on the Government to recognise the urgency of the backlog and deliver a new radical national plan, driven from Ministerial level and backed by investment in equipment, technology, IT and workforce and to sweep away bureaucracy that restricts cancer care capacity.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"It feels like Ministers and NHS leaders are hearing our words but still not accepting the magnitude of this COVID caused cancer crisis.</em></p>
<p><em>"We keep hearing that 'everything is in hand' and that there are 'encouraging signs' but this flies in the face of warnings from frontline staff, patients and cancer experts.</em></p>
<p><em>"The impact of COVID has laid bare the weaknesses in our underfunded cancer service and highlighted the need to do things differently.</em></p>
<p><em>"This crisis can't be solved by just exhorting the already exhausted staff to 'work harder'.</em></p>
<p><em>"We urgently need the Prime Minister to intervene and ensure we have a radical national plan backed with a real cash "super-boost" to give cancer services the tools and capacity they need to catch up."</em></p>
<p>Leading oncologist and co-founder of #CatchUpWithCancer, Professor Pat Price said: <em>"The cancer community is pleading with the Prime Minister to take this on as a national priority.</em></p>
<p><em>"He has said he wants to 'bust the backlog" but it has been over a year since the alarm was raised by the cancer community. And too often it feels like we are shouting into a void.</em></p>
<p><em>"The entire cancer pathway needs urgently restoring throughout the country, staff are exhausted and we simply don't have the capacity to catch up.</em></p>
<p><em>"The human cost of failing to act is simply unacceptable. And the economic cost of failing to act will undoubtedly be greater than putting it right. It simply doesn't have to be this way.</em></p>
<p><em>"The cancer community stands ready to help. Clinicians are brimming with ideas and innovative solutions. But we won't beat the backlog by talking our way out, or by asking NHS staff to "just work harder".</em></p>
<p><em>"We need proper investment, backed by the political leadership to ensure that investment gets to where it is needed most. The Prime Minister has shown what can be done with the vaccine program. Now, it's a national imperative that he works with us to do the same for cancer."</em></p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>South Shropshire MP, Philip Dunne, has expressed his disappointment at the delay to the government’s roadmap for lifting coronavirus restrictions, but said more time was needed to deliver vaccines against the Delta variant. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Prime Minister confirmed a four week delay to the roadmap, with the possibility of lifting restrictions after two weeks, should the data change to a more positive outlook. In a change to the current rules, the Prime Minister confirmed that weddings will be allowed to go ahead with more than 30 guests from 21st June, provided social distancing can be observed. </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Hospital admissions in England have increased by 50% in the past week, with over 70% of patients admitted aged under 65 - in contrast to previous waves, where the majority of hospitalisations due to covid were for older people. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: </span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>“The Prime Minister’s announcement of four-week delay is clearly very disappointing for everyone hoping restrictions would have been relaxed next Monday. In Shropshire, the case rate has quadrupled since late May - from a low point of 4.6 per 100,000 people for the seven days to 24th May, to 18.6 for the seven days to 8th June. </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>While this is a significant increase, it remains much lower than the average in England or the West Midlands, but the exponential increase is already leading to an increase in hospitalisations, predominantly now affecting younger, unvaccinated people. While one dose of the vaccine offers around 26-40% protection against the Delta variant, two doses offers 76-84% - and two doses provide around double protection of one dose against hospitalisation from the Delta variant, up to as much as 98%. </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The additional four weeks of lockdown will give time to ensure more people have received both doses of the vaccine, and the PM set out that by July 19th, every adult will have been offered at least one jab. I know for so many people, wedding delays have caused immense disappointment and difficulty, so I was pleased the PM confirmed weddings with more than 30 guests will be permitted from 21st June, provided social distancing can be observed.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But while this four week delay is in place, I encourage people to observe the rules and think carefully about the way in which the new variant is spreading fast here in Shropshire and across the country.”</span></span></span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="http://johnpenrose.org/wp/2021/06/11/pinsent-masons-fca-introduces-rule-to-protect-customers-from-insurance-loyalty-penalty/"><![CDATA[
<p>The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has introduced a remedies package aimed at improving competition in the insurance market, while ensuring that existing customers do not pay more than new ones.</p>



<p>Under the new rules, insurers will be required to offer renewing customers a price that is no higher than they would pay as a new customer. Although the FCA said the rules would likely mean that firms would no longer offer “unsustainably” low-priced deals, it estimated the measures could save consumers £4.2 billion over 10 years.</p>



<p>The rule change follows a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/fca-reform-general-insurance-pricing-governance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market study&nbsp;</a>carried out last year into insurance pricing. In a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-5.pdf" target="_blank">policy statement</a>&nbsp;(217 page / 1.92MB PDF) announcing the package, the FCA said there was general support for the pricing remedy, but respondents to its consultation had asked for more information about how the rules would operate in practice. As a result, the FCA included more guidance and detail on areas such as the treatment of incentives in the final rules.</p>



<p>The remedies package also includes measures to make it easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals, requires insurance firms to do more to consider how they offer fair value to their customers, and requires home and motor insurance firms to report data to the FCA.</p>



<p>Insurance law expert&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/people/iain-sawers">Iain Sawers</a>&nbsp;of Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law, said: “This is a full package of measures that has relevance beyond just home and motor insurance. All general and protection insurers and intermediaries will be affected and should be working to understand how the measures will apply to their businesses.</p>



<p>“In what will be challenging implementation periods, these will require significant changes to firms’ pricing, product governance and reporting processes, and to their customer journeys and distribution agreements,” Sawers said.</p>



<p>Competition law expert&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/people/angelique-bret">Angelique Bret</a>&nbsp;of Pinsent Masons, said: “The FCA’s remedies package is a significant milestone in ongoing efforts by UK regulators to tackle so-called loyalty penalties, and address their perceived detrimental impact on competition and consumers.</p>



<p>“Loyalty penalties, which can involve ‘price walking’ practices, and associated conduct such as certain auto-renewal arrangements, have been an area of focus since 2018 when the Competition and Markets Authority [CMA] received a super-complaint concerning business practices in mobile, broadband, savings accounts, mortgages, and household insurance sector,” Bret said.</p>



<p>“Since then, sector regulators have undertaken work to better understand and address loyalty-penalty concerns in their respective areas of competence; the FCA’s newly announced measures are a culmination of its work involving home and motor insurance products, whilst Ofcom has carried out projects to achieve improved business practices and fairness for consumers of mobile and broadband services and the CMA is conducting two investigations targeting auto-renewals in the anti-virus software and online console video gaming sectors,” Bret said.</p>



<p>Bret said the FCA rules followed increased calls in recent years to strengthen UK consumer law enforcement, to facilitate regulatory action against loyalty penalties and other practices seen as unfair or harmful to consumers. Earlier this year&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/penrose-review-uk-competition-consumer-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an independent report from John Penrose MP&nbsp;</a>recommended that restrictions on price discrimination and loyalty penalties should be extended beyond the financial services sector to be a general consumer protection regulation across the entire economy.</p>



<p>Rules changes to pricing, auto-renewal and data reporting come into effect on 1 January 2022. Other rules on systems and controls, product governance and premium finance take effect from the end of September 2021.</p>

<p>The collapse of Greensill Capital and the subsequent revelations about its relationship with the Government and Whitehall have raised significant concerns about the links between business and government in the UK. In light of this, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) has launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of rules to prevent conflicts of interest and regulation of access by current and former politicians and officials – the propriety of governance in light of Greensill. On Tuesday we heard evidence from the Rt Hon Lord Maude of Horsham, a former minister at the Cabinet Office, Ian Watmore and Sir John Manzoni KCB, both former Permanent Secretaries at the Cabinet Office, and Bill Crothers, a former Government Chief Commercial Officer at the Cabinet Office and former Director at Greensill Capital. From the evidence that we heard it is clear that adequate checks are not being undertaken to ensure that appointments are free from any conflict of interest. Our democracy is founded on the idea of fair play and equality – these links between business and the government whom they are likely to lobby undermine that foundation, regardless of the actions of those involved. We must safeguard our government processes from accusations of corruption and shady relationships if we are to maintain trust of the electorate in our abilities to govern fairly and without undue influence.  I look forward to working with the Committee to make sure this is the case.</p>
<p>This week, we have seen the Government’s plan for education recovery post-pandemic going from bad to worse. It is clear that they have no idea how to tackle the inequalities in education that have been highlighted by the pandemic nor how to support children get back on track after the last year. They seem to fail to understand that school is not simply a holding pen for our children during the day while parents are at work; it is meant to prepare them for adult life, to provide them with the tools they will need to navigate the world, both professionally and personally.  Children across the country have had an incredibly difficult year, and one that has the potential to affect them negatively in the long run – it is staggering that the Government are refusing to implement the recommendations of the advisor they appointed!  Money spent on education is one of the best investments we can make – but this Government’s short-sightedness will have a serious and negative impact on the future prosperity of our children and our society.</p>
<p>The Labour Party held a debate on the justice system for one of this week’s Opposition Day Debates, and called on the Government to do more to tackle the damage that a decade of underinvestment has wrought.  With record low conviction rates for perpetrators of sexual violence and an epidemic of misogyny that makes women and girls feel unsafe, this Government is treating victims of violence as an afterthought. And by doing so, they risk dissuading victims from reporting crimes.  This cannot continue.  Labour is putting tackling sex-based violence at the very top of our agenda and will work to ensuring that violence against women and girls remains in the spotlight until this Government take adequate action.</p>
<p>I was very pleased to visit Ashton Court, the Artspace Lifespace today. In May 2018, Artspace Lifespace took over the running of the Arts Mansion at Ashton Court and have worked to make it into a space for exhibitions, workshops, theatre and dance rehearsals and performances, and community activities. The pandemic has reminded us all of the importance of culture and the arts.  Lockdown would have been so much more difficult without the streaming of musicals and plays into our homes, without the virtual choirs, and without the plans made to get back into our cultural and social venues. Art is incredibly important to our wellbeing – as a way to express ourselves, as a way to relax and enjoy the world around us, as a way to see the world in a different light. I’m really excited at the plans Artspace Lifespace have for the coming months and years and am looking forward to visiting the exhibitions and seeing the performances they have planned.</p>
<p>I also met with Minister Nick Gibb MP and the Regional Schools Commissioner to discuss how the Government are holding schools in south Bristol to account for education outcomes for our children. It’s of the utmost importance that these meetings are arranged because ministers can become detached from what is happening on the ground. I have long said that I will do all I can to improve educational outcomes in south Bristol and securing the ministers attendance with our Regional Commissioner is one such method I can use to do this.</p>

<p>On the 31<sup>st</sup> May 2011 a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20084254">BBC Panorama documentary</a> revealed appalling abuse of people with a learning disability and/or autism at the Winterbourne View Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU).</p>

<p>10 years of missed targets later and there are still 2,040 people with a learning disability and/or autism living in ATUs that are completely inappropriate for their needs. The decade of failure to deliver on promises made after Winterboune View is the worst I’ve seen in 25 years of working in health and social care.</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-55/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This week I chaired a number of debates as part of my duties as a member of the Panel of Parliamentary Chairs. Ruth Jones MP for Newport West secured a very important Westminster Hall debate to consider the UK Government’s new funding streams which have replaced EU structural funds post-Brexit. In particular, the effect that the Community Renewal Fund (CRF) and the Levelling Up Fund (LUF) will have in Wales. Ruth opened the debate stating that the Prime Minister has let Wales down, and quoted Mark Drakeford “a plan made in Wales without Wales”. That the two new funds should be transparent, fair and balanced, and the process should not be in competition with home nations and regions of England, but that both funds fail in these respects. Ruth is a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee and she quoted from a recent evidence session which found that: the new funds will not be enough to replace existing EU funds; there is insufficient communication; the bidding system is unclear; decision making is confusing; the competition procedure not welcome; the timeline is too short (deadline next week); and Welsh Government (previous administrators of EU funds) will be by-passed. During the evidence session, the Under Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, thought that the Welsh Office would be involved, but the Minister for Regional Growth and Local Government, Luke Hall, thought that his Department would be administrating the funds. Ruth urged Minister Luke Hall, who was responding for the U.K. Government in her debate, to explain all the issues she raised. Gerald Jones MP Responded as Shadow Wales Minister and stated that we will always welcome extra funding to Wales, but the Welsh budget is still lower per person in real terms than it was in 2010. Gerald criticised the centralised Whitehall approach, which by-passes devolution and 20 years of the Welsh Local Government Association working together with Welsh Government to deliver successful regeneration projects all over Wales. Caerphilly CBC, which covers two and a half constituencies, and has some of the most deprived communities in Wales, has been excluded from the priority list for the CRF which is mind boggling. And the £8 million provided for the UK Government’s Free Port schemes is little compared with the £25 million given to England. Gerald asked the Minister specific questions: why Caerphilly and Bridgend had been excluded from the priority list; will the criteria for the CRF be the same for the U.K. Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF); will the Minister reconsider deprivation as a factor; will funding be allocated on a Local Authority basis rather than on a constituency basis and will the Minister reconsider working in partnership with Welsh Government and Local Government. Minister Luke Hall stated that his UK Government were committed to its levelling up agenda across all regions of the UK. The LUF was worth £4.8 billion across the UK and that Wales would get 5% of the £800 million allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland over 21/22 and 24/25. That he wanted Local Authorities and communities to be directly involved; the new funds allow cross border bids; 17 of 22 Local Authorities are on the priority list; the short timeline was designed to get Local Authorities to put a move on; the £125,000 to each local authority was to encourage them to develop a new relationship with UK Government and where he thinks appropriate he will consult with the Welsh Office. From a chair’s perspective, it looked as though both sides of the debate were talking past each other.</p>
<p>The next debate was secured by Jamie Stone MP Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross asking the BEIS Minister Paul Scully about delivery charges in the Highlands and Islands. Whilst chairing debates it is always a pleasure to learn about new topics. People in the Highlands council pay an average £14.67 more than people in the south of Scotland. Resolver found that delivery rip off charges are the second biggest complaint, behind online shopping. Jamie suggested to U.K. Government Minister Eddie Hughes that people across the four nations are upset about their experiences. In 1840 the penny post guaranteed that a letter arrived anywhere in the UK for a flat rate penny charge, and a parcel cost slightly more. Jamie suggested that: the two governments (U.K. and Scotland) should work together and sort it out; fix the roads and invest in infrastructure; use local delivery firms; that firms should be transparent with customers about delivery charges; introduce a flat rate fee that does not discriminate regarding postcodes and legislation to impose Royal Mail standards on delivery firms. Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for BEIS Eddie Hughes responded on behalf of the UK Government. The Minister stated that the UK Government recognises that delivery costs can be higher when reaching some parts of the UK but should be based on the real costs of transportation and has ensured access to an affordable, consistently priced postal service under the Royal Mail. That consumer protection laws are robust and state that information given by traders to consumers regarding delivery costs must be up front and transparent. And breaches of this law should be reported through <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/sVtrCwVJBfj3JEYuqzvOq?domain=deliverylaw.uk">deliverylaw.uk</a> but the UK Government has no role in interfering with business decisions, and the market is hugely competitive. That the Consumer Protection Partnership runs a dedicated working group of consumers, trading standards, and government representatives, including Scottish Government, and will continue to look at this issue. Ofcom is conducting a review of its future regulatory framework and will publish its consultation of postal services later this year. The Minister said that his priority is continued enforcement of the law and he thanked all postal workers who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep us all connected.</p>
<p>The next debate was moved by Tim Loughton MP East Worthing and Shoreham on the future of the learned societies at Burlington House. The society of Antiquarians, the Geological Society, the Linnaean Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Royal Society of Chemistry form the learned societies who have been in Burlington House in Piccadilly since 1850. These charities have preserved our histories, furthered our understanding of the world, and promoted discoveries and advances in the field of science, history, astronomy, natural history and earth sciences. Burlington House was where Darwin explained his theory of evolution. However, the future of the learned societies is threatened because their landlord, the UK Government’s Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has increased their annual rent by 3,000% in the past 10 years, and are set to double it in the next decade. When the learned societies signed the lease in 2005, they accepted that by 2085 they would be paying a commercial rent, but would have 45 years to adapt to a new model of income. But the increase started after 7 years and the learned societies haven’t had time to adapt. The lease prevents additional income generation through subletting or opening a cafe. They conducted a public value contribution analysis by PwC in 2019 and the result found an annual public benefit of £47,368,500. The UK Government has proposed a rent freeze, a rent holiday, and adjustments, but the rent is now unaffordable. Since 2019 the rent has increased by a further 39% at a time worsened by the pandemic, and the U.K. Government needs to produce a long-term, fair, and sustainable settlement. The official opposition spokesperson Jeff Smith MP Manchester Withington made the point that many businesses are struggling with commercial rents as a result of the pandemic and the UK Government has issued a code of conduct for landlords to encourage them to negotiate with tenants to find a workable solution for both parties and in this case the UK Government, as landlord to the learned societies, needs to lead by example. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Eddie Hughes MP stated that he could not refer in detail to the ongoing negotiations, but the UK Government wants to continue working closely with the learned societies to ensure that they remain in Burlington House. From the chair that sounded like a fudge.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I attended the AGM of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for the Olympics and Paralympics and was honoured to be re-elected as vice-chair, along with Lord Colin Moynihan and Baronness Tani Grey-Thompson. Sir David Ames MP was re-elected as chair. We discussed the forthcoming Tokyo Olympic Games to be held next month, and the possibility that we may hold a reception for the GB Team later in the year, should pandemic restrictions permit. I suggested that we should invite Lynn “The Leap” Davies from Nantymoel, who won his long jump gold medal at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games with a 8.23m jump that is still a Welsh record. Lynn and I trained together many years ago when we were both based at the National Sports Centre in Cardiff.</p>
<p>As a life member of the British-American Parliamentary Group, I attended a confidential webinar hosted by the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) with Congressman Adam Schiff, Chair of the US House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, entitled “The Threat to Liberal Democracy”. Adam Schiff and I became friends when I visited Washington in 2015 as part of a UK Parliament working group to study the US legislative process. Adam visited Neath later that year and enjoyed a tour of my constituency meeting many people. Adam stayed in the Castle Hotel, which flew the American flag during his stay. My dear friend Hywel Francis, who tragically passed away in February 2021, played a prominent role in organising a reception in Seven Sisters RFC, with Onllwyn Choir, and Bronwen Lewis put on a special concert for Adam in Dove Workshop, Banwen. Adam and I have kept in touch and it was so good to see him on the call. I’m sure that when travel restrictions are lifted, Adam will visit Neath again.</p>
<p>As a member of the Employers Initiative on Domestic Abuse (EIDA), I attended a teams meeting panel discussion hosted by Thames Water. Elizabeth Filkin, Chair of EIDA presided over the event. We heard from Nicole Jacobs, the first Domestic Abuse Commissioner, whose role has now been enshrined in the Domestic Abuse Act which has received its Royal Assent. Steve Maule, Moderator at EIDA, Leanne Wood from Vodaphone, Chris Luff Watford and West Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce. The Domestic Abuse Act will be implemented across criminal justice systems and agencies later this year, and the panel discussed what the Act would mean for employers. Several of its measures set out support for employees disclosing abuse, or for colleagues who suspect a member of staff is being abused. EIDA has a fact sheet on its website and will produce regular updates as measures of the Act are implemented.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, I presented my report of the work of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group to the Wales Council Co-operative Party zoom meeting. The Co-operative Parliamentary Group has continued to campaign for protection for retail workers against the violence, threats and abuse that they suffer in the workplace, and tabled amendments to the UK Government’s Police, Crime and Sentencing Bill that would introduce specific offences for assaulting retail workers. The UK Government’s response, that the current provisions are sufficient, is contrary to the weight of evidence. Preet Kaur Gill MP, chair of our Co-operative Parliamentary Group has lead the official opposition to the UK Government’s damaging cuts to the foreign aid budget, calling for a recommitment to the 0.7% target. At a time when the world’s poorest are suffering from so many problems, such as the pandemic and climate change, these cuts are undermining our efforts to tackle many global challenges. We have called on the UK Government to adopt President Biden’s proposal for a global minimum corporation tax rate, and have continued our campaign on Food Justice. The UK is one of the richest countries in the world and no one should go hungry, yet people are struggling to feed themselves and put food on the table, because of the UK Government’s pernicious policies. At the Wales Council Co-operative Party zoom meeting we said a fond farewell to our wonderful Deputy General Secretary and Wales Regional Officer of the Co-operative Party, Karen Wilkie after 26 years of dedicated service. Before the meeting, I delivered an engraved Welsh Slate plaque, a gift voucher (so that Karen can buy a pair of her favourite Doc Martin boots!) and a bunch of flowers to Karen’s neighbour. During our meeting Karen answered her door to her neighbour who gave Karen her surprise presents. Members of the Wales Council would have loved to have been there physically, but this was second best. To say that Karen was thrilled is a massive understatement, and we all wish her well for the future.</p>
<p>I was pleased to be able to speak in a Westminster Hall debate this week on the importance of the steel sector. Steel is a foundational sector across the UK and is particularly important in Neath Port Talbot county borough where the local economy depends on the supply chains that it creates. Port Talbot’s steelworks reaches all the surrounding communities and thousands of Neath constituents have worked there, know someone who works there, or work in its supply chain—my father did. To say it has been a difficult few years for the steelworkers in Neath Port Talbot would be an understatement. Competing in a global market, the absence of anti-dumping tariffs, the lifting of lesser duty rates and rising UK energy prices have conspired to create uncertainty and fear. Over 2,000 local jobs have been lost since 2014. Steel and the steel industry are vital to Wales and its economy. The idea that the steel sector does not have a future is unthinkable, but our steelworkers are as robust as the steel they make. They have bounced back from every adversity so far—but the situation is about to get much worse.</p>
<p>I recently signed a letter with colleagues to the UK Government on the recent Trade Remedies Investigations Directorate recommendations on the existing steel safeguards, which, if implemented, could be catastrophic for the UK steel sector. The lifting of safeguards would open up UK markets to trade diversion and have a negative impact on the remaining measures. The interconnected nature of UK steel means that a threat to one product category will have consequences for the others. This is the first major trading test for the UK in post-Brexit times, and the UK Government must establish a fair-trading environment for the UK steel industry and our communities. In contrast to their UK equivalents, the Welsh Labour Government has been standing up for steel, making an £8 million commitment to help secure a £30 million power plant at Port Talbot; offering £17 million of support for skills development; investing in energy efficiency; planning to reduce carbon emissions; and offering research and development funding for new product development. At critical times, the Welsh Labour Government has provided direct financial support to sites right across Wales, protecting our jobs and communities.</p>
<p>Labour’s chosen topic for one of last week’s Opposition Day Debates was the subject of the failures in the justice system. The backlog in the Crown Court is at record levels of more than 57,000 cases – and sat at 39,000 even before the pandemic began. The backlog has been exacerbated by the pandemic but it was created by the Conservatives closing half of all courts in England and Wales between 2010-19 and allowing 27,000 fewer sitting days than in 2016. Labour called for a package of emergency measures during the pandemic, including mass-testing in courts, the extension of Nightingale Courts, reduced juries until restrictions were lifted – all of which the UK Government ignored. Labour is now calling for a guaranteed 33,000 extra sitting days and more Nightingale Courts to clear the backlog. As a former barrister, I know how hard former colleagues have been working to continue supporting clients and how hard court staff have worked to keep the justice system afloat. A decade of underinvestment and undervaluing of the work that is done in the justice system has led to this crisis. A functioning and efficient legal system is vital to our democracy and to fairness. The UK Tory Government must put the investment into the justice system where it is needed most and fix this crisis so that once again, our legal system is a strong defender of justice and fairness.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues that fall under my role as an MP and want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

<p>Angus MacNeil MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar is urging any constituent who is an EU citizen to ensure they have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) before the deadline of June 30.</p>



<p>Irish citizens and people with indefinite leave to remain do not have to apply but all other EU citizens must apply to the scheme to continue living or working in Scotland.</p>



<p>Both adults and children need to apply.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “It is the Scottish Government’s view that EU citizens should not need to apply to protect the right they already have to live, work and study here but the UK Government has made it a requirement.</p>



<p>“The deadline is the end of this month and so I would urge any constituent who is an EU citizen who has not already done so, to apply.”</p>



<p>Scotland’s Europe Minister Jenny Gilruth has requested that the UK Government make a series of urgent changes to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) – including extending the 30 June deadline.</p>



<p>Full details on how to apply can be found here: <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/help-eu-citizens">https://www.mygov.scot/help-eu-citizens</a></p>

I’m proud to be a patron of the <a href="https://www.forl.co.uk/">Friends of Real Lancashire</a>. Every year I get Tameside Council to fly the red rose flag from Denton Town Hall on Lancashire day, but this year we’ve gone one better. There was a little-known regulation change a few years back when Eric Pickles was the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. He altered the transport regulations which previously stated that only administrative areas could be marked at boundaries to include the historic counties.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? On one level it doesn’t. Nothing changes. The boundaries set in the 1972 Local Government Act remain for both administration and ceremonial purposes. But our historic counties matter because they give us a fixed sense of place, identity and community pride.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the historic counties are ancient. Most predate the Norman Conquest of 1066. Lancashire is newer. It was created in 1182. It was given Duchy or Palatinate status in 1351. That meant that the Duke of Lancaster could exercise sovereign rights over the county as though he were King. Of course today, the Queen is Duke of Lancaster, but she still exercises Duchy rights within the historic boundaries. For example, if you die without a will and no obvious successor in Audenshaw, your property goes to the Duchy. In Dukinfield it goes to the Treasury.</p>
<p>People blame the 1972 Act for confusing the boundaries, but it started with the 1888 Act that created County Councils. You see, many of those councils did not follow the actual county boundaries. Towns that straddled the boundary were placed under the administration of one county council. So Stalybridge (part-Lancashire and part-Cheshire) was put into Cheshire County Council’s administration (though it retained a Lancashire Ward on the old borough council). Likewise, Mossley (part-Lancashire, part-Cheshire and part-Yorkshire) was put solely into Lancashire County Council’s administration; although to this day the Town Council has three Wards named Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire.</p>
<p>So now we have four new signs recognising our fascinating historic boundaries. These signs sit at Stockport Road, Mill Lane and Broomstair in Denton and at Shepley in Audenshaw. None of the funding came from Tameside’s highways budget, but from several separate sources, including the Denton Twinning Association and FORL. I’m now working with the Dukinfield Councillors to get Cheshire equivalents installed at the Tame too.</p>
<p>But having pride in the past doesn’t mean replacing our enthusiasm for the future. We are Tameside. It’s a great place, and part of the amazing Greater Manchester City region.</p>
<p>As we celebrate the past, we must continue to shape the future. We need to move forward with creating better transport links, greener jobs, and a cleaner local environment. Still, whilst we’re busy creating history, it’s always nice to recognise our own.</p>

    <title>Covid mortality rate for Sikhs worsened between the first and second wave </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/covid-mortality-rate-sikhs-worsened-between-first-and-second-wave" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP has called on the Government to urgently address health disparities between religious groups after new Covid data shows growing divergence.  </p>
<p>The latest ONS data emphasises the alarming Covid mortality rates among Sikhs, Hindus, Jews and Muslims compared to Christians and people of no faith. </p>
<p>Even more worryingly, this data shows that the Covid mortality rate for Sikhs and Muslims compared to Christians has worsened between the first and second wave. For Sikh men, the age-adjusted risk increased from 1.3 times to that of Christians, to 1.7 times. </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “Given the great pain experienced by the Sikh community during the worst of the first wave last year, it is extremely disturbing to see that not only has the work done on health disparities failed to keep up with the problem, it’s gone backwards” </p>
<p>“We know that structural inequalities stretch through every aspect of life and have a part to play in the enormous differences we have seen between different ethnic groups. However, these inequalities cannot be explained by ethnicity alone, and this new data paints a complex picture.  </p>
<p>“I have written to the equalities minister to ask that the lack of routine data collected on Sikhs is addressed. Currently, the ONS advises public bodies to only use the existing ethnic categories in the census to deliver public services. This excludes information for groups including Sikhs and Jews. Given the fact that this new information on Covid mortality rates shows stark differences between majority Asian religious groups, it seems increasingly misguided to ignore these factors. </p>
<p>“Better data and knowledge is integral in addressing disparities, especially when as it stands routine data collection for Sikhs does not exist. Public bodies must have better information on the communities they serve in order to address these shocking health inequalities.” </p>
<p>Dr Sukdev Singh, a resident in Edgbaston constituency, not only sadly lost a loved one to Covid but is also Chair of the Sikh Doctor’s Association and has had to support patients and families throughout the pandemic.  </p>
<p>He commented, “It is really concerning to see inequalities seemingly grow between Sikh people and those from other backgrounds. I’ve seen first-hand how devastating this virus has been to my family and my community. It’s disappointing that the Government hasn’t done more to protect those that are being the worst affected by the pandemic, particularly given the national debate on equality that was widely publicised following the first wave. </p>
<p>“The Government now needs to step up and support those who are worse affected so that we can recover from this crisis. But before these inequalities can be put remedied, the Government needs to start with understanding exactly how many people are from a Sikh ethnic background so that the right resource and funding can be sent to those communities.” </p>
<p>To read the letter from Preet Kaur Gill MP to the equalities minister, where she asks for an explanation on the steps being taken to ensure the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Sikhs is explained and in turn addressed with future monitoring of public service provision, please visit: <a href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-responds-news-covid-death-inequalities-worsened-between-waves" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-responds-news-covid-death-inequalities-worsened-between-waves</a> </p>

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Telecoms firm Openreach, the offshoot of BT working to install fibre broadband across the UK, have announced that thousands more premises in Beverley and Holderness are set to benefit from being connected to new, ultrafast full-fibre broadband, capable of delivering speeds upwards of ten times faster than before.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2,895 premises in Beverley and Holderness are to be included in Openreach’s expansion, which will deliver full-fibre broadband to at least 3 million more homes and businesses in some of the UK’s hardest-to-reach rural communities. All in all, Openreach will be connecting 25 million properties by an earlier deadline of December 2026, helping to meet the Government’s commitment to deliver gigabit-capable broadband to 85% of the UK by 2025.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The news has been welcomed by Beverley and Holderness MP Graham Stuart, who has been campaigning for his constituents to benefit from better internet connection, and encouraging residents suffering from poor broadband to contact his office in order to encourage new builds from Openreach and KCOM.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The local MP said, “Delivering better broadband is all the more crucial for people and businesses in my constituency as we recover from the effects of the pandemic.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“Covid restrictions have also shown us that we can benefit from better remote access to work and education, and research shows that Openreach’s national rollout could allow more than 1 million more people to access or return to employment, particularly older workers or those with caring responsibilities.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“It could also boost the UK economy by up to £59 billion, with particular benefits for rural communities like ours, and could cut carbon emissions as fewer people travel for meetings.”</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Alongside the expanded rollout’s benefits for consumers, Openreach have announced that it will create a total of 7,000 new jobs across the supply chain, with recruitment for the first 1,000 of these roles already beginning. Since 2017, 9,000 apprenticeship jobs have been created by Openreach’s national rollout.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The news follows Graham Stuart’s recent meeting with KCOM CEO Dale Raneberg, where plans to bring the telecoms firm’s ultrafast ‘Lightstream’ broadband to “sluggish” parts of the MP’s constituency were discussed.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham added, “I want my constituency to benefit from better broadband sooner rather than later, which is why I’m encouraging residents interested in improving their internet speeds to get in touch with me directly, so I can see if anything can be done.”</span></span></p>

<p>Mr Shapps attended a clean-up at the front of the station, helping clean the area of litter, as part of the ‘Great British Spring Clean- organised by Keep Britain Tidy.</p>
<p>At the station Mr Shapps met with Network Rail and station staff, donning protective gloves and a litter picker.</p>
<p>Of the visit, Mr Shapps said: “I’ve challenged Network Rail to clean up the network as much as possible before people start coming back, as we hope, get to the next stage of the unlock.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really important to make people feel more confident about being on the railway. I’m a big believer that if people find that the environment around them is clean, they feel happier and healthier. It helps people’s mental health [and] also helps with physical health as well.</p>
<p>“The Great British Spring Clean is a fantastic initiative, and I’m incredibly happy to be able to support it.”</p>
<p>Paul Rutter, Chief Environment and Sustainability Officer for Network Rail said: “So far, the local team have cleared 500 bags- nearly 5 tonnes rubbish- in the local area between Hatfield and Brookmans Park. Now we’re going to continue through to Finsbury Park and closer to London.</p>
<p>“[We are doing this] not just to make it look better, but also safer for employees and the travelling public.”</p>
<p>The Spring Clean runs until the 13<sup>th</sup> June. So far over 160,000 volunteers have pledged to tidy over 1 million miles of roads, rivers, beaches, and countryside.</p>
<p>Details about the campaign can be found here: <a href="http://www.keepbritaintidy.org">www.keepbritaintidy.org</a></p>

    <title>Worrying Questions over RFL’s elite academy decision</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/rlf-ead/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;As Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group, Judith has written to the RFL seeking an explanation on its elite academy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"&gt;&lt;ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"&gt;&lt;li class="blocks-gallery-item"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="737" height="1024" src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter1A-737x1024.png" alt="" data-id="2501" data-link="https://judithcummins.org.uk/worrying-questions-over-rfls-elite-academy-decision/appgrflletter1a/" class="wp-image-2501" srcset="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter1A-737x1024.png 737w, https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter1A-216x300.png 216w, https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter1A-768x1066.png 768w, https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter1A.png 911w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="blocks-gallery-item"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="732" height="1024" src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter2A-732x1024.png" alt="" data-id="2502" data-full-url="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter2A.png" data-link="https://judithcummins.org.uk/worrying-questions-over-rfls-elite-academy-decision/appgrflletter2a/" class="wp-image-2502" srcset="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter2A-732x1024.png 732w, https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter2A-214x300.png 214w, https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter2A-768x1075.png 768w, https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/APPGRFLLetter2A.png 911w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re: Award of Elite Academy licenses for 2022-2027&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am concerned at the recent announcement from the Rugby Football League (RFL) on the award of Elite Academy licences for 2022-27.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach taken and the outcome would appear to represent a reduction in opportunity in the community heartlands of the sport and a concentration predominantly in the hands of leading Super League clubs.&amp;nbsp;It has also thrown up some worrying outcomes&amp;nbsp;and raises a number of questions about its objectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chair of the decision making panel, Air Commodore Dean Andrew OBE stated afterwards that: “We did not work to award a set number of licences”. This is clearly not the case and&amp;nbsp;is at&amp;nbsp;odds with the RFL statement&amp;nbsp;that there was “an agreement that a maximum of 12 licences should be awarded – up to nine in ‘Core Affinity Areas’, up to two in ‘Emerging Affinity Areas’, and up to one in France.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is this&amp;nbsp;latter part&amp;nbsp;gives rise to concerns that this was about quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and potential and that crucially, deep roots into the community game may have had little weight in the consideration. I find it worrying that such links to the grass roots of the sport appear&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have been set aside.&amp;nbsp; It is, after all, the affinity of our communities for the sport and the part it plays in the life of towns and cities across the north that is the beating heart of the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;disconnect&amp;nbsp;appears most starkly illustrated by the&amp;nbsp;decision not to award an Elite Academy licence to Bradford Bulls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Bulls Academy has been&amp;nbsp;productive and respected&amp;nbsp;for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bradford Bulls is a rooted in the communities of Bradford, the people and the fans. The club sits at the apex of a vibrant local community rugby league structure, particularly in South Bradford. It acts as a powerful incentive and objective for young local players starting out in the sport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RFL’s decision endangers those deep social roots in an area with a huge affinity for the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also find it concerning that the club indicate that they have not had an explanation of the reasons that their application was unsuccessful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate a clear explanation and rationale for the approach taken for developing the&amp;nbsp;Elite&amp;nbsp;Academy&amp;nbsp;model, how this fits with developing players from the community game, and why Bradford’s well established and productive academy program was unsuccessful in that context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your consideration of these matters. I look forward to your reply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/coronavirus-covid-19-34/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about the changes next week to the lockdown rules, as well as on a couple of other local issues.</p>
<p>It is worth saying that although many of the rules on what you can and cannot do will change on 17 May, other restrictions do remain in place.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is the guidance from 17 May:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>You should continue to work from home if you can. When travelling within the UK, you should aim to do so safely and plan your journey in advance.</em></p>
<p><em>You should <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/">get a test</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a> if you have COVID-19 symptoms.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Gathering limits will be eased. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 30 people and indoor gatherings will be limited to 6 people or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>New guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-friends-and-family-covid-19">meeting friends and family</a>will emphasise personal responsibility rather than government rules. Instead of instructing you to stay 2m apart from anyone you don’t live with, you will be encouraged to exercise caution and consider the guidance on risks associated with COVID-19 and actions you can take to help keep you and your loved ones safe. Remember that the risks of close contact may be greater for some people than others and in some settings and circumstances, there will be specific guidance that you will need to follow even when you are with friends and family.</em></li>
<li><em>Indoor entertainment and attractions such as cinemas, theatres, concert halls, bowling alleys, casinos, amusement arcades, museums and children’s indoor play areas will be permitted to open with COVID-secure measures in place.</em></li>
<li><em>People will be able to attend indoor and outdoor events, including live performances, sporting events and business events. Attendance at these events will be capped according to venue type, and attendees should follow the COVID-secure measures set out by those venues.</em></li>
<li><em>Indoor hospitality venues such as restaurants, pubs, bars and cafes can reopen.</em></li>
<li><em>Organised indoor sport will be able to take place for all (this includes gym classes). This must be organised by a business, charity or public body and the organiser must take reasonable measures to reduce the risk of transmission.</em></li>
<li><em>All holiday accommodation will be open (including hotels and B&amp;Bs). This can be used by groups of up to 6 or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</em></li>
<li><em>Funeral attendance will no longer be limited to 30 people, but will be determined by how many people the COVID-secure venue can safely accommodate with social distancing.

<h2>Chalk Pit Epsom</h2>
<p>In my last update I mentioned the issue of the current use of the Chalk Pit in Epsom. I am pleased to say that since then the Environment Agency have stepped up their monitoring and rule enforcement at the site. They have already issued a number of breach notices against the users of the site, and have begun the processes to take stronger action if the problems continue. Those problems have not all gone away yet, though, and I am keeping in contact with local residents and the Environment Agency team to make sure that improvement action continues. I will also continue to press the County to reject the retrospective planning application for the current use.</p>
<h2>Volunteering</h2>
<p>I know that many of you offered to help the voluntary sector during the lockdowns over the past year, and in fact that there were more offers of help than were needed. But if you are still a would-be volunteer, a local charity, Surrey Care Trust is recruiting volunteer mentors. Mentoring is a simple but effective way for a person to give their support to someone who is going through a tough time or needs encouragement to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Surrey Care Trust volunteer mentors are people from the local community who give their time to help young people aged 11-18 and/or families with children aged 5-19, who are struggling to cope with their feelings and may be self-harming, are being bullied at school or are affected by relationship breakdown or domestic abuse at home. With the support of their mentors the young people feel better about themselves, cope better at school, and achieve a goals like going to college or improve relationships and family life at home.</p>
<p>Training for the volunteers and the service are all provided free of charge.</p>
<p>If you are interested in finding out more details are at <a href="http://www.surreycaretrust.org.uk">www.surreycaretrust.org.uk</a></p>
<p>I hope that you are able to enjoy a good summer as the lockdown restrictions ease.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

    <title>A Vision for Social Care</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/05/13/a-vision-for-social-care/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&amp;nbsp;of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. &lt;/p&gt;

        <p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

&lt;p&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&amp;#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to&amp;nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Coronavirus Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&amp;#8217;s handling of the pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can read the full letter &lt;a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for a nurses pay rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all they&amp;#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&amp;#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&amp;#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating St Patrick&amp;#8217;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting to safeguard employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&amp;#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Reed calls on Council to work with residents to save South Norwood Library</title>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>Successful cross-party letter with nearly 100 signatures supporting my School Breakfast Bill</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/successful-cross-party-letter-with-nearly-100-signatures-supporting-my-school-breakfast-bill/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I recently coordinated a cross party &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first – about the main characteristics of the product, on the second – about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well – involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

    <title>ROBERT JENRICK DAILY TELEGRAPH OP-ED 2.11.2020</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://robertjenrick.com/dailytelegraph2-11-20/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more facts, and to find out what this multi-million-pound government investment in our local NHS will mean for you and your family, visit the following website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk/faq"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk/faq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

	With Northern Ireland once again in politcial crisis and continuing divisions within unionism, we need to consider carefully the consequences, both for the Union itself and for efforts to create a shared future here.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
