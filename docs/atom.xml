    <title>The state of the public finances</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2023/02/22/the-state-of-the-public-finances/" type="text/html"/>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It is becoming more and more difficult to see an accurate picture of the nations finances given changes to the definitions and runs of data and the  accounting methods deployed.</p>
<p>Yesterday we learned that there was a £5bn surplus of revenue over expenditure in January., This was considerably   better than the OBR recent forecast. We should expect there to be a healthy surplus each January, as substantial sums of self assessment income tax, CGT and other annual taxes are paid following the filing of returns.</p>
<p>I found the more interesting figure was the one for the government’s cash surplus last month. That was a much healthier surplus of £21 bn for the one month. That is the excess of revenues over total bills paid by the government that month. The big discrepancy with the headline figure of just £5bn can be explained by non  cash items like the payment of £4.2bn of taxpayer  cash  to the Bank of England for its losses, where the cash sent to the Bank remains within the wider public sector, and the so called interest bill including the indexation changes on indexed government borrowings. The state does not pay these out as cash payments but they are rolled up until the maturity date of the bond which may be 20 years or more away. It will then be reborrowed, not  requiring tax revenue to pay out.</p>
<p>The figures suggest there is what the Treasury call headroom for some tax cuts in the  budget. The OBR will score lower tax rates  as losing the state revenue. There is an issue with this, as cuts in tax rates for taxes like Corporation Tax and higher rate Income Tax have always in the past led to more revenue  not less. Overseas experience as I highlighted yesterday is a lower rate of  business tax brings in much more revenue, encouraging so many more businesses to locate and invest in low tax jurisdictions. The headroom will be enlarged by Treasury accounting. By the year end when many expect the inflation rate to have more than halved there will be a big saving in the interest programme as the Treasury charge the  non cash item of indexation increases on inflation linked state debt to the debt interest programme. The energy subsidy programme will also produce large savings after the wind down in April.</p>
<p>Among the ideas the Treasury should adopt to assist growth and more capacity in our economy are cancelling the Corporation tax rise, improving the tax system for the self employed, raising the VAT threshold for small  business and suspending VAT on domestic fuel.</p>

  <summary type="text">On the floor of the House of Commons this afternoon, MP Tim Farron challenged the Minister for the Environment to force water companies to use their profits to clean up Cumbria's lakes and rivers.

  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On the floor of the House of Commons this afternoon, MP Tim Farron challenged the Minister for the Environment to force water companies to use their profits to clean up Cumbria's lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Speaking during an Urgent Question on Water Company Performance, Tim said: <em>"We have seen £2.8 billion in water company profits, £1 billion in shareholder dividends, and a 20% rise in executive water company pay, 60% of which has been in bonuses.</em></p>
<p><em>"In my book, bonuses are for doing a good job, not a terrible one.</em></p>
<p><em>"Meanwhile in Cumbria, the River Eden at Kirkby Stephen has had 101 days of sewage outflows, Swindale Beck at Brough has had 115 days, the River Eea at Cark and Cartmel has had 252 days, and Windermere lake at the heart of the English Lake District has had 71 days.</em></p>
<p><em>"All of that, outrageously, is legal. When will the Government force the water companies to clean up not only their act, but our lakes and rivers too?"</em></p>
<p>In response, the Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: <em>"If I might say, the honourable gentleman is a fine one to talk.</em></p>
<p><em>"I believe the water Minister in the coalition was a Liberal Democrat: what exactly did he do?</em></p>
<p><em>"It is this Government who are taking action now on the water companies.</em></p>
<p><em>"This Government introduced the storm overflows reduction plan and, in addition to that plan and all the requirements it puts on the water companies, just this week the Secretary of State has asked that a plan be submitted for every single storm sewerage overflow, with water companies' proposed actions clearly outlined."</em></p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim said: <em>"The minister is living in cloud cuckoo land if she seriously believes this government is stopping sewage being dumped in our lakes and river.</em></p>
<p><em>"People in Cumbria have had enough of empty promises from the Government - we need action now."</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was very impressed by my visit to a local
Stroke Association group which helps stroke sufferers recover from the
physical, mental and emotional difficulties that a stroke can bring. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So often a&amp;nbsp;stroke comes out of the blue and is a
life-changing event having a major impact, not only on the sufferer but on
their family as well, affecting everything from employment and financial
circumstances to relationships social life. &amp;nbsp;So it was heart-warming to
hear first- hand, that as soon as a stroke patient is discharged from hospital,
the local Stroke Association makes contact and offers a whole range of
expertise and support. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The support group that I visited is part of that on-going
support: it meets once a month and enables sufferers and their families to
access support and information as well as to share knowledge and experiences
with those who find themselves in similar positions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The help provided by the Stroke Association in
Carmarthenshire continues to be invaluable and it was encouraging to see and
hear directly from each individual how they have been supported, with the
Stroke Association often enabling them to resolve or pre-empt difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;

<p class="x_ContentPasted0">Recently, it was reported that instances of criminal damage to shops, schools, leisure centres and businesses have increased by more than 30% over the last year.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">These figures will come as no surprise to local people, who have felt the harsh reality of the rise in antisocial behaviour over the last 13 years. Stinging cuts to community police has meant that we now have around 1,000 fewer PCSOs in the North West, hamstringing local police services and damaging public confidence in the safety of their communities.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">What’s worse, even when perpetrators are caught, we’re seeing a reduction in community sentences being handed out and applied. According to the Ministry of Justice, just 71,138 community sentences were given in 2021, that’s down from 189,333 in 2010.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">These statistics are shameful and should be a wakeup call to a Government that has been asleep at the wheel when in comes to antisocial behaviour. It just isn’t acceptable that local people no longer feel safe where they live and are watching offenders get away scot-free time and time again.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">I’ve always been a strong believer in clamping down on antisocial behaviour. That’s why I’m so proud to support Labour’s plans to prioritise tackling antisocial behaviour if elected at the next General Election. This includes creating mandatory antisocial behaviour police officers in every community, and reimposing ‘respect orders’ which would create a new criminal offence for repeat adult antisocial behaviour offenders.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">We would also set up Community and Victim Payback Boards, which would see victims and community leaders getting a say on appropriate punishments and making perpetrators accountable to the community that they have damaged.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">This would come alongside 13,000 extra neighbourhood police on Britain’s streets, including at least 10,000 more officers, PCSOs and specials.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">I have worked closely with local police, and there have been some notable improvements. However, until we start seeing the Government take antisocial behaviour seriously, we are facing an uphill battle.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">I’m confident that Labour’s plans would be a hugely effective at tackling the criminal behaviour which has become all too common in our communities.</p>
<p class="x_ContentPasted0">So, my message to the Government is simple; either get a grip and make our communities safe again, or move out of the way and let Labour get on with the job.</p>

&lt;p&gt;I asked the Minister if he would wish &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NUFC?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NUFC&lt;/a&gt; well in Sunday&amp;#39;s final and if he would commit to an Independent Regulator and give fans real power over the beautiful game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t get an answer to either but he did tell me he had a ticket! &lt;a href="https://t.co/tUhpTz5amW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tUhpTz5amW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;p class="hs_Para"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are on our way to Wembley, and I am sure the Minister will join me in wishing every success to Newcastle United in the league cup final on Sunday. However, he must know that even that success will not erase the years of anger and frustration at unsuitable, unaccountable, and sometimes downright dodgy ownership within a Premier League that is out of touch and does not seem to care about fans. Fans should be at the heart of football, but this Government are messing with the heart and soul of fans. Will the Minister commit now that the White Paper will institute an independent regulator and that fans will have real power in the beautiful game, and that those measures will be in place by the start of the next season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Feeding Leicester is the programme to end hunger in the city and I have chaired this work for the last four and a half years.</p>
<p>At our last meeting we heard from local hospitals who are having to provide free and low-cost food to patients, visitors and staff, and from Leicester’s two universities who are helping students also struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p>Leicester City Council also told us about the brilliant work they are doing to provide free food and activities for children during the school holidays.</p>
<p>We will continue to work together to help anyone struggling to access food so they don’t go hungry, and provide advice so people get the money they are entitled to. For more information, click <a href="https://leicester.betteroff.org.uk/#/home">here</a>.</p>

    <title>WEST DUNBARTONSHIRE RESIDENTS URGED TO REDEEM ENERGY VOUCHERS BEFORE DEADLINE</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://martindocherty.scot/2023/02/20/west-dunbartonshire-residents-urged-to-redeem-energy-vouchers-before-deadline/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Households in West Dunbartonshire with prepayment gas and electricity meters are being urged to ensure they have redeemed their energy rebate vouchers.</p>



<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes is working to support families impacted by fuel poverty, and called on those with prepayment meters to check that they’ve received their vouchers ahead of the deadline.</p>



<p>Almost one in five households in Scotland use prepayment meters for their gas or electricity, according to figures from Advice Direct Scotland.</p>



<p>Most households will have £400 automatically taken off their electricity bills in six instalments or will have the money added to their accounts, through the government’s <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/energy-bills-discount">Energy Bills Support Scheme</a>. However, those on traditional prepayment meters need the vouchers to get the discount.</p>



<p>Figures show that 1 in 5 eligible households have yet to redeem their December vouchers, which have a deadline of 8th March. Customers who have not yet redeemed their January vouchers have until 9th April. If your voucher does expire, you can ask for it to be reissued. All vouchers <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-energy-bills/getting-discount-energy-bill">must be redeemed by 30th June 2023.</a></p>



<p>Residents on prepayment meters are being urged to check unopened mail, in case the vouchers have been missed. They can also get in touch directly with their energy suppliers – using contact details found on bills, statements, and official websites – to check if they’ve received the support they’re entitled to under the Energy Bills Support Scheme.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“This winter has been a struggle for many of my constituents due to the soaring costs of gas and electricity. Those on prepayment meters have been especially at risk of falling into fuel poverty.</p>



<p>“It’s vital that families ensure they are receiving every penny of support they’re entitled to. I’d urge anyone in West Dunbartonshire with a prepayment meter to double-check they’ve redeemed their energy vouchers ahead of the upcoming deadlines.</p>



<p>“The advice is to check unopened mail, in case the vouchers have been missed, and get in touch with energy suppliers – using contact details found on bills, statements, and official websites.</p>



<p>“If there are any difficulties with your energy supplier then please get in touch with my office and I’ll do all I can to assist.”</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my February email newsletter. It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks since the start of the year in Parliament, and I&#8217;ve been pleased to raise local and national issues in the House on issues such as pensions, road improvements and recycling/waste changes, which you can find more about below. I&#8217;ve also included some local updates on projects such as the Heanor High Streets Fund works and the long-awaited installation of step-free access at Alfreton, as well as access to health appointments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there are any issues you&#8217;d like to discuss further or that I can help with, please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch via the contact details at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>War in Ukraine – President Zelensky visit</u></strong></p>



<p>In Westminster we had the great honour of welcoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to give an address to parliament. He spoke about bravery when faced with the horrors of war, praising the courage of the men and women in Ukraine who are defending their country, and highlighting how the people of the United Kingdom embody these values themselves. It was a moving yet tongue-in-cheek speech, demonstrating that the Ukrainians share the classically British sense of humour in the face of adversity.</p>



<p>We should be incredibly proud of the support we have given to Ukraine, and the impact that we have made in helping them to defend their country. I wholeheartedly support the Government’s efforts to support Ukraine, and the equipment and training which has been provided to the Ukrainian military. It is right that the United Kingdom continues to stand up for freedom and democracy on the world stage, and to defend these values as we have done before.</p>



<p>I will be speaking to Radio Derby about the war in Ukraine as part of their coverage of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion.</p>



<p><strong><u>Pensions debates update</u></strong></p>



<p>We’ve certainly had the time to cover pensions over the last few weeks in the House of Commons. As part of my role on the Work and Pensions Committee, I’ve had the chance to speak at length in a number of debates on various aspects of pensions, and the future of our pension system.</p>



<p>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February, I chaired a Backbench Business debate on State Pension Age. We had cross-party consensus in favour of postponing a further increase to the state pension age, and discussions were had on life-expectancy in the UK. I argued the case that any further increases must consider differing effects of manual vs professional workers, and high-earners vs those who earn the least. Given the consensus against a further increase to 68, I urged the Government to factor our discussion into their upcoming review of the State Pension Age.</p>



<p>On the 6<sup>th</sup> of February, the House of Commons debated the plans to uprate pensions and benefits with inflation. I spoke strongly in favour of benefits and pensions increasing by 10% in line with inflation and argued further that there needs to be a review to work out whether the benefits and pensions given to individuals across the UK are in line with their expected living costs. Families and pensioners relying on Government support should be given enough to cover their basic needs and housing costs.</p>



<p>Finally, on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February, I attended a debate in Westminster Hall on protecting pension savers. Our discussion focused on ensuring self-employed people, gig-economy workers, full-time carers and women are all protected and supported in saving sufficiently for retirement. These groups have historically found it more difficult to save, and discussions were had on how to protect and improve their pensions. I spoke repeatedly about reforms to protect these vulnerable groups, and also on the Government new plans for an online dashboard, which will help people more easily track and plan their pension savings.</p>



<p>There are a number of changes on the way to modernise and improve the pension system, and to ensure not only that pensioners are appropriately supported in retirement, but that people are easily able to track their pensions and empowered to save sufficiently for their futures.</p>



<p>I am proud to be a part of these ongoing discussions about our pension system and the support provided to pensioners in the UK and you can find my recent contributions in the House in these debates in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-02-07b.247.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g251.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>APPG Cleaning &amp; Hygiene update</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of January I chaired a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cleaning and Hygiene. It was enlightening to speak to professionals working in cleaning services and the manufacturing of cleaning products about the industry and its importance in supporting out NHS and preventing the spread of disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was happy to be joined in this meeting by John Hines from SC Johnson Professional, who have a manufacturing plant in Denby.</p>



<p>The group was able to discuss our recent report on the role which the cleaning and hygiene industry can plan in pandemic resilience and response, as well as supporting the NHS and reducing the spread of winter flu. One of the outcomes of the report was to encourage people continue the good habits we all developed during the pandemic, which will help keep our homes and families safer and healthier.</p>



<p><strong><u>Junction 28 improvement works debate</u></strong></p>



<p>Whilst Junction 28 of the M1 isn’t directly in Amber Valley, the delays currently caused at peak times as a result of the daily congestion in this area regularly back up into our area, sometimes as far as Alfreton and Swanwick.</p>



<p>Neighbouring MP, Mark Fletcher, within whose Bolsover constituency J28 lies, is campaigning for a capacity upgrade to reduce congestions and delays, and I was pleased to support him and his campaign during a recent Westminster Hall debate in Parliament.</p>



<p>I took the opportunity to raise related issues such as noise from the A38, capacity on the roads and the importance of improvements to Junction 28 to driving growth as well as reducing the problems currently being caused.</p>



<p>You can read the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-01-11b.293.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g297.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Recycling &amp; EPR</u></strong></p>



<p>There will be a lot of changes to our waste and recycling systems coming forward over the next few years, to encourage less landfill and more recycling.</p>



<p>As a result, I recently raised a question in Parliament about the introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) for packaging, and the potential impacts of this. You can read my question and the Minister’s reply, as well as the debate in full, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2023-01-30.135354.h&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g135354.q0">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Heanor Future High Streets Fund project update</u></strong></p>



<p>Work is progressing on the Heanor Future High Streets Fund and regeneration projects. I’ve been pleased to join the programme board overseeing progress.</p>



<p>Final designs for the new Heanor marketplace have come forward and these are coming out to consultations on the 21<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> February at St Lawrence Church, as well as being recorded and available on the AVBC website shortly after. If you’d like more information on these, please contact <a href="mailto:regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk">regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, works is progressing on the plans for the regeneration of the former Heanor Grammar School into the Heanor Hub. The planning application is still live but essential works have been taking place to prevent the further deterioration of the building, with works to the roof and the removal of asbestos. I was pleased to recently visit the Grammar School to have a look around the site.</p>



<p>Finally, the remediation and regeneration of the land at Whysall Street as part of the brownfield regeneration fund is also moving forwards. Surveys have started, and a £1m grant has been secured to tidy up the site prior to turning it into 40 new affordable homes.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP &amp; dental appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have been in touch regarding access to GP and dental appointments. As one specific example, Brooklyn Medical Practice in Heanor has recently moved into the Royal Primary Care Trust.</p>



<p>I’m working to arrange update visits with them and other local GPs and dentists to discuss issues they may be facing, and feed back on issues which have been raised with me by constituents.</p>



<p>I also continue to regularly meet with our local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to discuss updates and hospital treatment updates/waiting lists with them.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to cash &amp; banking services – new deposit service announced for Ripley</u></strong></p>



<p>I know that access to cash and banking services is an issue many constituents have contacted me about, and whilst I can’t stop banks who sadly decide to close their high street branches, I have been regularly meeting with them to discuss this and maintaining access to banks for residents.</p>



<p>In addition to this, Link and Access to Cash UK are working on new ways to maintain banking services in our high streets.</p>



<p>As part of this, I’m pleased that Ripley was recently selected by Link to have a new shared deposit service in the town. This will provide consumers and businesses with convenient and accessible ways to deposit cash even if they cannot visit a bank branch.</p>



<p>I’m scheduling a meeting with Link to discuss this further, as well as access to cash in Amber Valley’s other towns, and I’ll keep you updated. Please let me know if you have any views or suggestions in the meantime though. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Step-free access for Alfreton Station update</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been in contact with Network Rail to chase updates on the long-awaited Alfreton Station access for all scheme, which is due for completion by April 2024.</p>



<p>Whilst I’m disappointed by the delays to date, I’m pleased by the progress that is now being seen, with work on the various reports and surveys now taking place. For instance, Network Rail are progressing the coal mining, topographical, ecological and drainage surveys which will then inform the final draft designs and plans.</p>



<p>I’m meeting with Network Rail over the next few weeks to get further updates and timetable information, which I’ll update you on in my next newsletter.</p>



<p><strong><u>Shared Prosperity Funding Success &#8211; £2.9 million additional funding for Amber Valley</u></strong></p>



<p>I’m pleased that confirmation has been received that the Borough Council is receiving £2.9 million in Government granting funding through the Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF). This is part of the Levelling Up agenda, and the funding will be spent across Amber Valley over the next few years.</p>



<p>In particular, projects which will receive investment include improvements to our town centres, new community sports and leisure facilities, including investment in our local parks and play areas. There will also be £240k for community and voluntary sector organisations to bid for to support specific projects and improvements.</p>



<p>Specific projects so far confirmed include a new skatepark for Heanor, shop front improvement grants and the installation of solar panels on our local leisure centres.</p>



<p><strong><u>Residents’ survey reminder</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been out and about across Amber Valley delivering a survey to as many residents as possible to ask for your views and priorities for this year ahead. If you haven’t received one yet, or if you haven’t completed it, please take just a couple of minutes to let me know your views on local and national issues online <a href="https://fs22.formsite.com/nmills002/form1/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Events at a hotel housing asylum seekers in Liverpool are a reminder of what happens when government loses control of something like immigration and those bent on trouble take the law into their own hands.</p>



<p>This government has been talking tough on immigration for thirteen years. During that time, the criminal gangs have multiplied and the number of people whose claims aren’t being dealt with has steadily risen. Among those languishing in dodgy hotels are women and children, doctors, nurses, school teachers and other skilled people. Many are from war zones or places like Iran, from which it shouldn’t be too difficult to decide their refugee status.</p>



<p>We need a fast and efficient processing system that allows us to weed out those without a real claim from proper asylum seekers. Genuine refugees should be allowed to stay and put their skills to use, especially in those areas where we have shortages. Those without a legal entitlement should be deported.</p>



<p>The latest government plan is to hand Rwanda £144 million and send people there, but evidence from places like Australia and Israel shows it doesn’t work. The gangs just move part of their operation and pick people up as they get off the plane, to take them once again on a perilous journey that will end up with small boats trying to cross the channel. Labour says that money could be better spent by putting an extra 13,000 police officers and PCSOs on our streets, expanding the National Crime Agency to smash the smuggler gangs and setting up legal processing centres in places like France and Turkey.</p>



<p>While the government continues to talk tough but fails to tackle the problem, it encourages the kind of ugly behaviour we saw in Liverpool. It fuels the gangs and with them the drugs and prostitution which are part of their evil trade, and it punishes genuine refugees who could be an asset to this country.</p>



<p>When you’re in a hole you stop digging. It’s time to come up with a better solution, one that’s fair, compassionate and tough on the right people.</p>

              &lt;div class="field--item"&gt;  &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shropshire boost to drug &amp; alcohol recovery and treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;South Shropshire MP Philip Dunne welcomes grant to Shropshire Council of £1 million in extra funding to combat drug and alcohol misuse over the next two years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This funding will help to improve services for people addicted to drugs and alcohol and will contribute to curbing related crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This funding builds on the Government’s ambition in the next 10 years to deliver a state-of-the-art treatment and recovery service for those struggling with addictions – whilst helping to deliver and reduce drug use to an all-time 30-year low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The extra funding means Shropshire Council has seen a 22% boost in funding to provide services, taking the overall committed spending to £3.3 million until 2024/25. The overall national funding will enable the creation of over 50,000 high-quality places for drug and alcohol treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Funding will also enable the local authority to hire more staff to work with people with drug and alcohol problems, support more prison leavers into treatment and recovery services, and invest in enhancing the quality of treatment they provide. More people will benefit from residential rehabilitation or inpatient detoxification, while improvements to the recovery services will sustain them outside of treatment – helping to reduce relapse rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Dunne said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Drug and alcohol misuse has a massive impact on the wider community including families of those suffering from addiction. Staggeringly we see more than 3,000 people pass away each year due to misuse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This funding locally in Shropshire will provide life changing recovery services. These are crucial for rehab and will provide a high quality setting where those who struggle with addiction can be provided with specialised staff trained to deal with addiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many other countries on the continent have much lower rates of relapse credited to their treatment and recovery services. Today’s announcement is a step in the right direction to helping get people’s lives back on track. This in turn will reduce the pressure on the NHS in helping those suffering with addiction, who often attend A &amp; E.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will also help drive down crime, where about half of thefts, burglaries, and robberies, are related to addiction.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Karin Smyth MP backs Labour’s plan to bring back neighbourhood policing, as statistics show a 35% cut to PCSOs across the South West</title>

<p>Karin Smyth – MP for Bristol South – has welcomed Labour’s plan to make Bristol’s streets safer and bring communities closer so that the causes of crime can be tackled. </p>
<p>Labour have attacked the Tories’ failure to keep local communities safe, as shocking new analysis shows huge reductions in staffing for neighbourhood policing in the South West.<br/>
The number of PCSOs across the South West has collapsed by 35% since 2010. </p>
<p>The most recent crime statistics show a 67% increase in reported robbery since 2015 and 85% increase in knife crime in the South West.</p>
<p>Labour has pledged to bring back neighbourhood policing by putting 13,000 more neighbourhood police on Britain’s streets, including recruiting at least 10,000 more officers, PCSOs and specials. </p>
<p>Labour’s plans are the equivalent of giving every constituency in England and Wales 15-20 extra neighbourhood police – formed of officers, PCSOs, and Specials.</p>
<p>Across the country, the number of PCSOs has halved since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. In the same period, the proportion of people saying they never see a police officer on the beat has doubled.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“Under the Tories neighbourhood policing has been cut to the bone. Without a local police presence on our streets or an outreach officer in our schools we will not be able to tackle the root causes of crime.</p>
<p>“The last 13 years of Tory mismanagement of policing and our courts has seen 67% increase in robbery in the South West and a disgraceful 85% rise in knife crime. All the while PCSOs were cut by 35%.</p>
<p>“Labour’s plan to rebuild neighbourhood policing from the ground up will ensure that communities across south Bristol can feel safe once more. When we last had a Labour Government crime was at a record low and prosecutions were swift. The next Labour Government will do this once more.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/02/16/karin-smyth-mp-backs-labours-plan-to-bring-back-neighbourhood-policing-as-statistics-show-a-35-cut-to-pcsos-across-the-south-west/">Karin Smyth MP backs Labour’s plan to bring back neighbourhood policing, as statistics show a 35% cut to PCSOs across the South West</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.</div>

    <title>Nottingham deserves a fair share from Government</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Nottingham City Council’s executive board will next week consider a paper with proposals to set a balanced budget over the four years of the Medium Term Financial Plan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920-1024x698.jpg" alt="money, loose, coins" class="wp-image-2931" width="399" height="272" srcset="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920-300x205.jpg 300w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920-768x524.jpg 768w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920-1536x1047.jpg 1536w, https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/coins-g06f3a83a2_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Government cuts to funding have cost all Nottingham residents over the past decade &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The council must set a balanced budget by law – but Nottingham has had funding taken from it by the Conservatives year on year – with Revenue Support Grant falling from £126.8m a decade ago to £26.7m last year. This is the equivalent of £694 less this year for every household in Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City residents will recognise form their own stretched budgets the costs of fuel and general inflation that have hit councils hard up and down the country. Council staff who worked so hard for our city during COVID have had a well deserved nationally agreed pay rise but that comes without any additional funding from Government. Like many city residents, they are actually getting a real-terms cut when inflation is considered – but this also represents an additional cost to council budgets that has not been covered by national grants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Adele Williams, Deputy Leader and Portfolio Holder for Finance in Nottingham, said: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Nottingham people will remember Rishi Sunak bragging that ‘Labour shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas and that needed to be undone. I started the work of undoing that.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nottingham deserves better than an out of touch Tory government that drains funding from our hardworking city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are amongst the lowest charging local authorities when ranked by average council tax paid – 45th out of 309 last year, but we know any increasing costs at all are unwelcome when people are facing rising food, rent and energy costs and mortgage rates are going up after the disastrous reign of Liz Truss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Council tax is going up to fill the gap left by the very thing Rishi Sunak was boasting about. They managed to fix the funding formulas to take money from Nottingham, but they never managed, despite repeated promises, to fix adult social care so Nottingham council taxpayers get the bill for that too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government has shifted responsibility to local council taxpayers to fund statutory areas such as adult and children’s social care and the costs of homelessness. In both the adult social care precept rise and increased council tax, local people pay for the Conservative failure to fix the scandal of adult social care funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Council tax isn’t fair and it isn’t fair that Nottingham people have to fill the hole the Conservatives in Westminster have left in council budgets. We will speak up for a fairer deal for Nottingham in our full council meeting when the budget proposals are considered in March. We ask Nottingham voters to send a powerful message to the Tories through the ballot box in May. The Conservatives have wreaked havoc in our economy, council and household budgets. Nottingham has had enough.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ARTICLE: Our Name Stands For Democracy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/article-our-name-stands-for-democracy/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=article-our-name-stands-for-democracy" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have all learned to laugh at the term ‘Liberal Democrat’. And little wonder. They have proven themselves neither liberal (they enabled the Tory austerity bandwagon), nor democratic as they repeatedly collude to deny the people of Scotland democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lib Dems care nothing for the Parliamentary majority for Independence and thoroughly deserve their tortuous descent into irrelevance in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Labour’ has also woefully failed live up to its title. What is labour about a party, complicit in, and now supportive of Brexit and the subsequent bonfire of EU workers’ rights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A party happy go along with the associated work force crisis imposed on business, industry, the Health Service – and to see those working in it put under even more strain and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour’s failure to stand up for those forced to strike is notable, with MPs banned from showing picket line support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of demanding that our NHS is supported they push the line that more, not less, privatisation is needed. What a shower. They talk the big talk on the value of democracy but are just empty shirts when it comes to the crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They bend over backwards – no contortion too demeaning – to deny the reality of Parliamentary democracy in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I come to the Tories. The term ‘Conservative’ is supposed to mean conventional, stable even old fashioned… do you recognise any of that from the Tory politicians of your lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, since Thatcher, they have gradually, then rapidly, become dangerous, right wing radicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their disastrous Brexit, ‘go home’ vans, creation of the ‘hostile environment’, Rwanda and ‘rape clause’ policies they are openly dangerous, while their toxic, ideological, and illogical, self-harming has been terrible, especially for Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservative and Unionist Party’s brazen, brass necked, dishonest approach to politics leaves too many examples to list – but I’m about to have a go. And their obvious utter contempt for our nation’s rights are laid bare in the House of Commons on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two parties are much the same, just not in government. So cronyism, cash for peerages, law-breaking lockdown parties, dodgy ‘fast lane&amp;#8217; contracts is a story told across all unionist benches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Worse Together’, the Westminster parties have squandered the money that has come from YOUR natural resources and taxes by the countless billions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time they want to talk about Scottish ferries (hundreds of Clyde shipbuilding jobs saved incidentally), they might want to reflect on the £4 BILLION spent on new RAF Nimrods that were scrapped before they ever flew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they’ll consider for a moment the now, probably useless, AJAX tanks, described by a Parliamentary committee as ‘beyond a joke’, five years late and at £5.5 BILLION from the original £2 BILLION budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they will recall the unusable PPE kit at £10 BILLION; £105 million for UNUSED plans for Euston Station; £43 million on the never built London ‘Garden Bridge’ or the financial horrors of the HS2 shambles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s not omit their recently proposed new royal yacht – a snip at £250 million – now sunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s much more too, too much, by far, to cover here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though they are brazen, in their denial of Scotland&amp;#8217;s democratic right to choose, they reached new heights thanks to Tory top man – the soon to be Lord – Alister Jack, a consistent, if incoherent denier of Scotland’s democratic rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alister (let’s call him Ali), recently produced a new whopper: despite Scotland’s 62 per cent EU remain vote and polls of around 70 per cent for re-joining the EU, he claimed ‘There is no appetite in Scotland for re-joining the EU.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s comical Ali. But all this is no joke. Take my word, keeping tempers and doing our best to represent our country and constituents at Westminster is so difficult in the face of the unionists’ dangerous game: an ever-decreasing circle of obstruction and denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNP stands for Scottish National Party. But that is far more than a just name. It signals we stand for all of Scotland and her right to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the year unfolds we will look to all parties and politicians that respect and cherish democracy to support us as we work at Westminster to ensure that democracy, and more importantly, Scottish democracy, prevails.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Isles MP urges island households to redeem energy rebate vouchers before deadline </title>

&lt;p&gt;Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is urging island households with prepayment gas and electricity meters to make sure they have redeemed their energy rebate vouchers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to figures from Advice Direct Scotland, almost one in five households in Scotland use prepayment meters for their gas or electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most households will have £400 automatically taken off their electricity bills in six instalments or will have the money added to their accounts. However, those on traditional prepayment meters need the vouchers to get the discount. PayPoint said that 79 per cent of customers have so far redeemed their December vouchers, which have a deadline of March 8. Customers who have not yet redeemed their January vouchers have until April 9.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mr MacNeil said: “I would urge any households in Na h-Eileanan an Iar who use prepayment meters to check if they have received vouchers. With energy prices still incredibly high, it’s vital that households get all the support they’re entitled to.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advice Direct Scotland urges households to:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check unopened mail, in case the vouchers have been missed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check with energy suppliers, using contact details found on bills, statements, and official websites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Local Update</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/local-update-10/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear constituent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with a further update about a number of local issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Draft Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly and most importantly for those who live in or adjoining Epsom and Ewell, the Borough Council has now published its draft local plan, setting out where it intends to allow new homes to be built in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan involves the construction of about 5,000 new homes. Some of this is on uncontroversial brownfield sites, but unfortunately they have not so far adopted my proposals for the redevelopment of the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas. Instead the proposal involves substantial development on green belt sites around Epsom, particularly the Horton farm area, which is the open farm land next to the old hospital site developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now have to consult on the proposals, and I would encourage everyone to read what is planned and to contribute to the consultation. You can find all the details about how to do this via this link, as well as the list of sites which they plan to develop. You have until 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March to respond to the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/local-plan"&gt;www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/local-plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do circulate this to your friends and family locally so that everyone has the opportunity to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also be worth conveying your views to your local Residents Association, as it is RA councillors who control Epsom and Ewell and are the decision makers on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Properties for Ukrainian Families&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked by the local refugee network to explore again whether there are any landlords willing to make properties available to rent to some of the Ukrainian families who have been welcomed into our area. Sadly the war is continuing and many cannot yet hope to return, and they are now working locally and expecting to be here for a while. Many are looking for private accommodation which enables them to move out from the homes of the families who have been kind enough to host them so far. If you can help, please email &lt;a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tree Planting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrey County Council has a programme to plant over a million trees during this decade as part of its environmental strategy. I have been approached by a local resident who has been working to get trees planted in their street about the process for doing this, and asking me to highlight the opportunity for anyone else who is interested. If you would like to get trees in your street, the details of how to do so are here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/permits-and-licences/planting-trees"&gt;www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/permits-and-licences/planting-trees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please though do bear in mind that this does not work in every street, as sometimes trees damage pavements and make it more difficult for elderly and disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make a Difference Awards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, BBC Radio Surrey has asked me to highlight its “Make a Difference Awards” to celebrate people who have done positive things in the local community over the past year. If there is someone that you know who has done amazing things locally and you would like to nominate them, you can find a full list of categories &amp;#8211; and details of how to nominate someone &amp;#8211; at &lt;a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/tJNGCr8AwC86q6L0Iy47DD?domain=bbc.co.uk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bbc.co.uk/makeadifference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominations are open now and close on 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March at 11:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Grayling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local MP Grant Shapps met with Jamie, an aspiring politician who attends the day service at Woodhall Community Centre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woodhall Opportunities Project is a service provided by St John of God Charity, which helps adults with disabilities to reach their full potential and achieve their personal and professional goals through educational support and real-life experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of Jamie’s key objectives was to become more engaged with the local community, which he swiftly acted upon by visiting the MP&amp;#8217;s Office to express his interest. Mr Shapps was keen to meet Jamie in person to discuss his ambitions further and organised a visit to Woodhall. Jamie has since thrown himself into voluntary work around Welwyn Garden City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting, Jamie commented: “I loved meeting Grant. He was nice, signed my documents, and will help me with my goal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The service manager at Woodhall, Mo, was thankful for Mr Shapps’ visit: &amp;#8220;Jamie has been very excited to get involved in local politics and asked us to help him do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are grateful to Grant Shapps and his team for making the time to visit Jamie who has been looking forward to the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps appreciates all the incredible work that Woodhall Community Centre does and is so impressed with Jamie that Mr Shapps has invited him to Downing Street:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I have high hopes for Jamie, he has a very bright future ahead of him!” said Mr Shapps. “I look forward to seeing him in Downing Street soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Care to ensure that defibrillators are available both at school and in the wider community is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>That is why I’m delighted the Government has announced a new £1 million Community Automated External Defibrillators Fund to provide match-funding for new public access defibrillators. This will help to ensure that areas with the most need for defibrillators have them. I would encourage all local charitable and non-profit organisations to apply for the grant.

    <title>Our Letter to the Prime Minister on Fulfilling Dementia Commitments</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/our-letter-to-the-prime-minister-on-dementia/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"><h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;">We Demand that the Government <span style="color:#06396a;">Fulfils its Commitments on Dementia</span></h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Today I joined Alzheimer’s Society Ambassadors Vicky McClure and Dame Arlene Phillips as well as Elliot Colburn MP and Ananga Moonesinghe, who lives with dementia, to deliver an open letter to PM Rishi Sunak at Downing Street, demanding the Government urgently fulfil their promises on dementia.</p>
<p>Launched by leading dementia charity Alzheimer’s Society, the open letter has been signed by over 36,000 members of the public and famous names including Choreographer Dame Arlene Philips and actor Vicky McClure. We were joined at the hand-in by my colleague on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, Vice-Chair Elliot Colburn MP, showing cross-party support. It urges Rishi Sunak to deliver on previous Conservative Party commitments to dementia and not let the UK’s biggest killer fall down the political agenda.</p>
<p>Previous Conservative Prime Ministers have actively committed to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. Now Rishi Sunak must deliver on promises to reform social care, double dementia research funding and release a ten-year plan for dementia which gives the condition the priority it deserves. The 36,000 people who signed the open letter are making themselves clear – they don’t just want to hear empty promises, they want to see action. People with dementia can’t and won’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates still sitting below pre-pandemic levels, national figures reveal people are waiting up to two years in some areas for a diagnosis, thereby missing out on vital treatment and support. Alzheimer’s Society research also shows three in five people affected by dementia struggled to get social care in the past year, with half of family carers revealing they ended up in crisis, such as rushing their loved one to A&amp;E due to lack of support</p>
<p>The charity is concerned the deepening workforce crisis in social care – with vacancies sitting at 165,000 – risks leaving people with dementia desperate for help while living costs soar. Alzheimer’s Society say it’s more important now than ever for the Government to prioritise dementia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Government has made many commitments on dementia, promising to deliver a ‘visionary ten-year plan’ for dementia, to reform the social care system and double spending on dementia research by 2024.  Alzheimer’s Society says the delivery of these will be transformational for the lives of the 900,000 people living with dementia but calls on the Government to urgently make these a reality to prevent a deepening crisis in dementia care.</p>
<p>This follows the news last year that a new drug, lecanemab, was shown to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this breakthrough will mean little if diagnosis rates remain stagnant and often inaccurate. This treatment works best for people with early Alzheimer’s disease. Without early and accurate diagnosis, we risk hopeful advancements like this having minimal effect.</p>

    <title>What is the Impact of Distance Learning in Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/what-is-the-impact-of-distance-learning-in-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We’ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-85/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I attended the funeral of my dear friend Ceridwen Rogers, known as Crid. Many years ago I met Alan Rogers, former MEP and former MP for the Rhondda, and his wonderful wife Crid. We saw one another often from 1983 until 1998, but we have lost touch over the subsequent years. However, I was delighted to meet their daughter Catherine, Acting Principal of NPT College Group, chair of Welsh Netball, and their son-in-law Mark Dacey (married to another daughter, Alison), Principal of Neath College, in 2014 and we have become close friends. Crid was a pillar of the local community wherever they lived all over the world. A socialist, feminist, Alan’s office manager, member of Cefn Hengoed Ladies Choir (who sang at her funeral) and so much more. Gelligaer Church was full of Crid’s family, friends, and members of community organisations. RIP my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As part of the Stonegate Group’s annual investment programme, it has invested £174,000 into the Castell-Nedd Arms in Neath town centre. I was delighted to take my staff to visit and see the improvements. We met with the operator of the pub Kayleigh Strinati, the Group’s area manager Danny Cross, and the bar staff. Kayleigh told us that she had worked in the pub trade for a number of years, and she felt that it was time to take that step up to managing the Castell-Nedd. She completed the training requirements, and then Covid struck. But when the pub re-opened again, the customers gradually came back to what had become a social hub for many people who live in Neath. The new challenge is the “cost of living crisis”, but Kayleigh is providing a very warm welcome for people to gather, talk, listen, watch TV, use the Wi-Fi, as well as great refreshments. The refurbishment includes new windows and seating area overlooking Angel Street, a pool and darts section, and many more facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2712"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2712" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1D2F4A81-ED7E-449E-8944-5797D4A54227-560x420.jpeg" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I visited the Churches Together Nativity Scene which this year is displayed in the Greyhound Trust Charity Shop Window, instead of in the Town Square. It is secure and able to be seen by all passers by. Massive thanks to the charity shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I met with Mark Fisher, NPT Council Unison Representative, to discuss Fair Funding for the council. Mark has always done a fantastic job representing Unison members, and although it was announced this week that NPT has received a better than anticipated settlement of 7.1% from Welsh Government, he shared his concerns about pressure on future budgets, and the continuing “cost of living” challenges faced everyday by every one of his members. Mark will be holding a Fair Funding Event at NPT Council for local elected representatives and his Unison members on Friday 13th January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;After the meeting, Mark and I joined the Royal Mail workers who are striking for a fair pay settlement and no diminishing of their terms and conditions, on their Picket Line which was outside the Royal Mail Sorting Office in Neath. There was a great turnout, and many passers-by supported the strike. People were dropping off food to keep the workers going in the freezing, sub-zero temperatures. In solidarity, I bought all the strikers coffee from our superb local coffee shop, Brew &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2713"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2713" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/71AD8D08-F334-4B81-ADF0-2D1614C1BD81-560x420.jpeg" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Mynydd Fforch Dwm Windfarm is a proposal by &lt;a href="https://mfdwindfarm.co.uk/about-us/"&gt;Naturalis Energy&lt;/a&gt; to provide clean, carbon free energy to homes and businesses across South Wales, including a renewable energy park near Tonmawr. Naturalis is a joint venture between Falck Renewables and REG Windpower energy companies. A number of constituents have contacted me regarding the proposal, asking me to call into the one of the Naturalis public consultation sessions. I dropped into the one held at Neath Little Theatre to view the plans and listen to a presentation by Naturalis staff. As part of the Development of National Significance (DNS) planning process Naturalis are required to undertake a comprehensive programme of pre-application engagement consultations. As an MP I have no remit over Welsh Government or Local Authority Planning applications. My role is to pass on the views and concerns of all my constituents to the stakeholders involved in a particular planning application. Please email me and I shall make sure that your questions are passed onto the stakeholders involved in this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My brother James was suddenly taken seriously ill and was rushed to Basingstoke Hospital. My daughter Angharad and I visited him in hospital, but James died following his fight against his illness which turned into pneumonia. My big brother was always there to look after me, after the death of my father, when I was seventeen. James was an industrial pharmacist, worked all over the world, and had many friends and colleagues. James was brought up by my grandparents who owned the Walnut Tree Pub in Kenfig Hill. He was a product of Bridgend Grammar School, Loughborough and Cardiff Universities. James organised the old boys network for former pupils of his old school. My grandfather was a founder of Kenfig Hill RFC, and my parents managed the bar. Rugby was part of James’ life, and he was proud to play number 8 at schoolboy rugby for Wales. I have lived with my brother all over the world at various times during my life. He was my mentor, my hero, my rock. I am devastated at the passing of my beloved brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Being a member of the congregation of St David’s Church Neath has been a great source of comfort to me. The people who go to my church are genuine, caring, supportive, never forget that life is very challenging, and we are always there to help each other through the good and the not-so-good times. It was so good to see my friends at the Choir Coffee Morning at St David’s Church, Neath. Many thanks to everyone who came to help and support. Coffee, cake, festive music with loyal friends in the beautifully Christmas decorated church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s an honour to be a patron of YMCA Neath and I really enjoyed the Christmas Fayre. There were stalls, arts and crafts, jewellery, face painting, glitter tattoos, pottery painting, tombola, lucky dip, raffle prizes, and refreshments. It was so good to catch up with Centre Manager Claire Hicks, and Admin Officer Jessica Kennedy. As a lifelong vegan, it was good to meet YMCA staffer Rhys Oliver who has recently started her delivery business “Vegan Kitchen – Food with a conscience – Made in Wales”. Rhys was selling a taste of her produce, vegan sausages, pasties, and chocolate cakes. Her menus are changed weekly and are made freshly on the day of delivery. And all packaging is environmentally friendly. Please email Rhys on DaffodilBach@gmail.com or telephone 07947715435 to place your orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I dropped into The Haven to meet my dear friend Major Mary Wolfe, her successor Major Neil Duquemin, and Skills Coordinator Christina Davies. On the day of my visit, The Haven had provided 48 Christmas lunches to their regular clients, but their door is always open to anyone who wants to call in and have a substantial breakfast for 50 pence, and a choice of lunch for a pound. On Wednesdays, agencies are based in The Haven for the day to offer help and advice, including Citizens Advice, the Wallich, Medical Staff, and Jobcentre Plus. Christina delivers skills courses including “budgeting on benefits”, and “cooking on a limited income”. My heartfelt thanks to Mary, Neil, Christina and all the volunteers who give up their time everyday for the homeless and people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2714"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/F5AD216A-2D09-4C5D-A382-D5F671130946-560x560.jpeg" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It was an absolute delight to meet the winner of my Christmas Card 2022 Competition Caitlin Vaughan, aged 6, and her mother Hannah. Thank you to all the children who sent in their designs. It is always a very difficult task to select a winner, but Caitlin’s card was exceptional for one so young. Special mention for Gorazd Trajkovski from Skopje, Macedonia, aged 10 who won the International Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2715"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2715" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/8E3138C3-FA2C-4191-A3BE-698499C533AB-560x420.jpeg" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On the last day in the Neath Office, I took my wonderful Neath Office staff for Christmas lunch. This is our first Christmas lunch since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. My I take this opportunity to wish all my constituents a very merry Christmas and a happy, healthy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2716"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2716" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BB5F61DE-C53B-4E60-98D7-9EC5CC5EE178-560x560.jpeg" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd New Warehouse in Andover</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://kitmalthouse.com/2022/berry-bros-rudd-new-warehouse-in-andover/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=berry-bros-rudd-new-warehouse-in-andover" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world’s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It’s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

    <content type="xhtml">

<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p></div>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A&amp;E at The Royal Glam</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.chrisbryantmp.org.uk/ae-at-the-royal-glam/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
