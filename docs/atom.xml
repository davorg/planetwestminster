    <title>Signing international Treaties</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The U.K. has signed too many Treaties in my life so far. They seek to bind the country in for the long term. Where they succeed it offends one of our fundamental democratic principles that one Parliament cannot bind a successor. If a government signs up to a Treaty obligation which the Opposition disagrees with then it is particularly offensive as the incoming Government will find it difficult to disengage. I and my friends had two wins when both main parties wanted to sign the Maastricht Treaty. To secure it through Parliament the government had to gain the opt out from the single currency, the main point of the Treaty. It also secured an exit clause from the EU as a whole, which transformed our options and outlook.</p>
<p>Other Treaties do not offer such good opt outs or fail to include an exit clause. They become ways of freezing policy on an issue to the global consensus at the time of their making which may prove wrong or damaging. I do not think it would be a good idea to sign a binding Treaty designed by the World Health Organisation based on the current level of pandemic knowledge. We should learn from their data and experience and incorporate their best ideas in our future health management but not bind ourselves in.</p>
<p>All Treaties are in practice subject to revision or termination if all the signatories come to agree they are outdated or wrong. Some Treaties are necessary to settle a peace. These should not be disrupted by a losing combatant when they get stronger, but may need UN or other external guarantors. Treaties about everything from the environment to health usually go too far in crimping democracy. Sign too many and swathes of self government are constrained or prevented, or a future government has to exit them or amend unilaterally how to interpret them.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to be invited on a tour of the emergency engineering works currently being carried out around the Tame Viaduct and in Reddish Vale Country Park.</p>
<p>Because of the progressive erosion of the riverbank, one of the viaduct pillars was identified by Network Rail as at threat of collapse. I’m really grateful that Network Rail have acted so quickly to address the consequences of this riverbank erosion.</p>
<p>Crucially, Sustainable Stockport – led by Cllr Sheila Bailey – worked with network rail to ensure that the work didn’t harm or adversely impact the River Tame, or its wildlife.</p>
<p>As I was walking around the vast engineering site, I was reminded about how important it is to be proactive in protecting, defending, and enhancing our precious green spaces. Now I’m not just talking about big structural engineering works, but smaller responsibilities that we all have as members of a community.</p>
<p>I’m always inspired when I see local people out and about on litter picks or community clean-up days. Local Councillors regularly collaborate with residents to organise clean up days, and I’m really proud of all that they have achieved across Reddish.</p>
<p>In particular, I would like to thank Jude Wells, who recently stood down as Councillor for Reddish South. Alongside her exceptional work as Cabinet Member for Adult Care and Health, Jude worked tirelessly to improve our green spaces, but also to engage local residents to recognise the importance of them. I’d like to take the time to sincerely thank Jude for her time on the Council.</p>
<p>We recently had local elections, and whatever your politics, we should all recognise the value of having Councillors who stand alongside and work with residents to improve our communities. Ultimately, this is what politics is all about.</p>

<p>The government announced on 3 February 2022 that a Council Tax Rebate, a payment of £150, will be made from April 2022 and will not need to be paid back. This is different to the Energy Bills Support Scheme. </p>



<p>Households are eligible where, on 1 April 2022, they are liable for council tax on a property which is in council tax bands A-D and which they live in as their main home. This includes those who receive Local Council Tax Support, even if their council tax bill for the year is less than £150. </p>



<p>For those living in eligible properties and  who pay their council tax by direct debit, Birmingham City Council will make the payment directly to your bank account, you do not need to do anything in the meantime. Birmingham City Council have stated that they are preparing the first payment files this week and will confirm the dates once payments commence, your bank statement will show this as £150 received from &#8216;B’ham City Council&#8217;</p>



<p>If you live in an eligible property and do not pay your council tax bill by direct debit, Birmingham City Council will need to confirm your payment details. You can either supply your bank account details so we can make a payment directly into your bank account or ask for the rebate to be credited against your council tax bill. The Grant Approval Website has now been launched so you can tell us this information and can be found here: <a href="https://birmingham.grantapproval.co.uk/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=/Requests/QuickSchemeLink/301A40" rel="nofollow">https://birmingham.grantapproval.co.uk/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=/Requests/QuickSchemeLink/301A40</a>  </p>



<p>Birmingham City Council have also made arrangement&#8217;s made to support council taxpayers who are vulnerable and need help completing their online form. If you need to access this service, please call 0121 303 1113 to arrange an appointment.</p>

    <title>Weekly round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/05/13/weekly-round-up-26/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-26" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div id="fb-root"/>
<p>This week the Government presented its plans for the forthcoming Parliament in the Queen’s Speech. The lack of content and ambition for a positive agenda to end the cost-of-living crisis and level up our country demonstrated again a government out of ideas, out of excuses and out of time.</p>
<p>I can point to things in my Bristol South constituency that were delivered by the last Labour Government—schools rebuilt, a brand-new hospital, and the investment that came there that those people deserved after the 18 long years under the previous Tory Government. Sadly, history is repeating itself. We have had Tory Government for 12 years and once again the public realm has got tatty and services have been ripped from our community.</p>
<p>I spoke in the Queen’s Speech about how, as a new MP seven years ago, my early speeches in the House of Commons were all about apprenticeships, devolution and the need for us to work together locally to grow our local economy and share in the prosperity of Bristol. That has always been my politics. In 2015, apprenticeships were a Tory flagship policy. However, we now know that apprenticeship starts have declined since 2010 by nearly 200,000, or 41%. Apprenticeships are so important in Bristol South because of the poor attainment of people in getting to university. Apprenticeships are also crucial for the small businesses that dominate Bristol South, which are desperately short of skills, and for my constituents, who are desperately short of well-paid, secure work. As we have heard, apprenticeships are crucial to building the green jobs of the future to help us tackle the climate crisis head on. Why not insulate our homes? Why not support those jobs? Why not save energy on the demand side as we face this terrible supply-side crisis? It should not be so hard in a prosperous city such as Bristol to match the desire and needs of business with the ambition of local people.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I was pleased to welcome more than 50 employers, including Agincare and Professional Apprenticeships, who are all based in south Bristol, as well as First Bus, St Monica’s trust, the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, One Front Door and the National Careers Service, to my sixth jobs and apprenticeships fair at the Skills Academy. Apprenticeships offer such vital pathways to young people who do not see their future through an academic pathway at university but who want to learn the skills that will give them the opportunities to make a good living and take on interesting careers. The Government’s failure to appreciate the importance of funding apprenticeships and to support businesses take on apprentices is weakening their levelling up plans and limiting the opportunities of our young people.</p>
<p>It was great to be out in the community today. I visited Bluebird Care and chatted to some of the staff who do such excellent work looking after many of our older loved ones. Providing the services that allow people to grow old with dignity and control over what happens to them is a vital part of our democratic and modern society. The staff at Bluebird are amazing – caring and dedicated to all those they look after. I also talked to the staff at Hawkspring, a community organisation based in Hartcliffe which supports people recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. They have been offering video and telephone sessions with 15 structured support sessions to help them through their recovery. I was also pleased to visit The Park at Knowle West. The centre offers space for community learning, business, support services, and various leisure activities. The staff there try to offer something for everyone and are dedicated to helping people find new interests or pursue qualifications. There are some truly fantastic people working to help build a real community in Bristol South and it was great to meet some of them.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to this month&#8217;s newsletter, which includes a special note on today&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech at the opening of this session of Parliament and the support the Government is introducing to help with the rising cost of living. There&#8217;s also local news on progress with the regeneration of the former Heanor Grammar School, a new training academy in Alfreton and a summary of the recent local election results. </p>



<h2><strong><u>Queen&#8217;s Speech summary:</u></strong></h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech at the opening of Parliament set out 38 new bills focused on helping to ease the cost of living, growing the economy, cutting crime and supporting communities, clearing the backlogs from Covid and making the most of the freedoms offered as a result of Brexit. </p>



<p><em><u>We are growing the economy to improve living standards by:</u></em></p>



<p>• Providing £22 billion of support to help families to tackle the global cost of living increase, easing costs for households.</p>



<p>• Supporting people into high-skilled and well-paid jobs through our multi-billion pound Plan For Jobs, giving thousands of people the security of a job. We have a strong labour market helped by our multi-billion pound Plan For Jobs – with a boosted National Living Wage of £9.50 per hour, an extra £1,000 a year for an average full-time worker, focussing on ensuring work pays.</p>



<p>• Levelling up and regenerating our towns and cities through our landmark Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill, shifting power to local leaders. Our Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill will deliver planning reforms, regenerate towns and cities and shift power and accountability to local leaders giving communities a louder voice which will empower communities across the UK.</p>



<p>• Reforming our higher education system through our Higher Education Bill, raising education standards and increasing fairness within the system. Our Higher Education Bill reforms the higher education system to raise standards and introduce the lifelong loan entitlement – helping every student fulfil their potential wherever they live.</p>



<p>&nbsp;• Introducing our Energy Security Bill, delivering a more secure and homegrown energy system that is more affordable and cleaner, cutting costs for families. Our Energy Security Bill will deliver a cleaner, more secure and affordable homegrown energy system that will create tens of thousands of jobs whilst cutting household bills for families and achieving energy sovereignty.</p>



<p>• Modernising our business rates system through our Non-Domestic Rating Bill, increasing fairness for business owners. Our Non-Domestic Rating Bill modernises the business rates system with more frequent revaluations based on more accurate data, increasing fairness for business owners on the amount of business rates they pay.</p>



<p>• Improving tenants’ rights through our Social Housing Regulation Bill, ensuring better quality and safer homes.</p>



<p>• Introducing our Social Security Bill, allowing more people nearing the end of their life to get fast-tracked accessed to key disability benefits.</p>



<p>• Enabling the sale of Channel 4 through our Media Bill, strengthening the UK’s system of public service broadcasting. Our Media Bill will enable the sale of Channel 4, allowing the channel to embark on a new chapter of its journey and strengthening the UK’s public service broadcasting sector by increasing competitiveness.</p>



<p>• Putting Great British Railways on a statutory footing through our Transport Bill, making our transport system more reliable and efficient for passengers.</p>



<p><em><u>We are using our Brexit freedoms to grow our economy, ease cost of living pressures and support British business by:</u></em></p>



<p>• Seizing our Brexit freedoms through our Brexit Freedoms Bill, putting us in control of our own laws which best deliver for the UK.</p>



<p>• Strengthening our school’s system through our Schools Bill, raising standards for students, reforming funding and encouraging attendance. Our Schools Bill will level up opportunity by delivering a stronger and more highly performing school system that benefits every child, regardless of where they live.</p>



<p>• Introducing our Trade (Australia and New Zealand) Bill, implementing our Free Trade Agreements as we strike out as Global Britain. Our Trade (Australia and New Zealand) Bill will enable the implementation of our Free Trade Agreements with Australia and New Zealand as we strike out as Global Britain and take control of our own trade agreements free from EU restrictions.</p>



<p><em><u>We are making streets safer and cutting crime by:</u></em></p>



<p>• Recruiting 20,000 new police officers, helping to keep our streets safe. We have already recruited 13,576 new and an extra £540 million will be invested by 2024-25 to complete this recruitment.</p>



<p>• Enshrining the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) Act into law, keeping dangerous offenders behind bars for longer. Our PCSC Act introduces whole life orders for child killers, life sentences for drivers who kill while intoxicated, and ends the automatic early release of dangerous violent and sexual offenders.</p>



<p>• Bringing forward a Draft Victims Bill, strengthening rights for victims by placing the new Victims’ Code on a statutory footing. The drafted Victims Bill will set out to restore victims’ confidence that their voices will be properly heard and that perpetrators will be brought to justice.</p>



<p>• Strengthening our approach to modern slavery through our Modern Slavery Bill, protecting human trafficking victims. Our Modern Slavery Bill will strengthen protection and support for human trafficking victims and increases transparency in supply chains – stamping out modern slavery in our society.</p>



<p>• Carrying our Online Safety Bill over from the previous session to improve safety online, making the UK the safest place in the world to be online. Our Online Safety Bill creates a new regulatory framework that improves user safety online while safeguarding freedom of expression – making the UK the safest place in the world to be online.</p>



<p><em><u>We are funding our NHS to clear the Covid backlogs by:</u></em></p>



<p>• Following the unprecedented challenges placed on the NHS by Covid-19, we are investing £36 billion as we clear the backlogs.</p>



<p>• Recruiting an additional 27,000 nurses and investing £1.5 billion to create an additional 50 million GP appointments, tackling the backlogs. We are recruiting 27,000 new nurses and investing £1.5 billion to create 50 million more GP appointments, and we are delivering our manifesto commitment to build 40 new hospitals, alongside £2.3 billion to increase diagnostic activity with ambitions to roll out up to 160 community diagnostic centres over the next three years.</p>



<p>• Bringing forward our draft Mental Health Act Reform Bill, putting patients and the centre of mental health services.</p>



<h2><strong><u>Cost of living support:</u></strong></h2>



<p>Many residents have understandably raised the issue of the rising cost of living as something they are particularly concerned about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we emerge from the pandemic, we have been increasingly confronted by global inflationary pressures caused by the world economy starting up again. Much of this inflation is driven by rising energy costs as worldwide demand grows and supply is unable to keep up &#8211; as well as the effects of the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to these pressures, the Government has announced £22 billion of support for families.</p>



<p>This includes a £200 rebate on energy bills for all households, to be paid back over the next five years at £40 per year starting from April 2023. Secondly, the Government has announced a non-repayable £150 cash rebate for households in Council Tax bands A-D, which include the vast majority of homes in Amber Valley. And finally, the Government will provide local authorities with a discretionary fund of nearly £150 million to help low-income residents in houses outside of Council Tax bands A-D.</p>



<p>In the Spring Statement, the Chancellor also outlined further measures to help families cope with the cost of living by cutting fuel duty, lifting the National Insurance personal threshold, cutting the basic rate of income tax from 2024, scrapping VAT on energy saving materials and doubling the existing Household Support Fund to £1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I welcome&nbsp;these measures as I believe they strike an appropriate balance between remaining responsible with the nation’s finances as we recover from the pandemic and providing families with both immediate and longer-term help with the cost of living.</p>



<p>I know that many are concerned about this year’s pensions and benefits increase being based on inflation figures from September. As inflation figures are now substantially higher than they were in September I share your concern that the increase will not be sufficient, and that a more appropriate measure would be to use the most recent inflation rate from December. Back in February, I spoke in the House of Commons to raise my concerns and outline my position on this issue. While the uplift has remained, I am very glad the Government has confirmed that the pensions triple lock will return next year as planned; so that pensions will rise far more substantially in 2023.</p>



<p>I will continue to support and push for measures to help residents cope with pressures on household budgets. </p>



<h2><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council local elections &#8211; 5th May 2022:</u></strong></h2>



<p>Last week, on Thursday 5th May, a third of the seats on Amber Valley Borough Council were up for election. Within the Amber Valley constituency, voters went to the polls in&nbsp;Alfreton, Somercotes, Swanwick, Ripley, Ironville and Riddings, Codnor and Waingroves, Heanor East, Heanor West, Heanor and Loscoe, Langley Mill &amp; Aldercar, Shipley Park, Horsley &amp; Horsley Woodhouse and&nbsp;Kilburn, Denby &amp;&nbsp;Holbrook.</p>



<p>Congratulations&nbsp;to all successful candidates. You can find the results in full&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudy.email/app/l/BDGlAfE5skafprx5eZHxlg/zpSedWI763dP73qdtMASWlPQ/BSzgv7630Ctm2dqDj5BMruJQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and you can find your local councillor&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudy.email/app/l/BDGlAfE5skafprx5eZHxlg/43Eeo763KdFOUoGfcZOzy0Dg/BSzgv7630Ctm2dqDj5BMruJQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong><u>Progress on regeneration of former Heanor Grammar School site &#8211; purchase completed!</u></strong></h2>



<p>It was recently confirmed&nbsp;that Amber Valley Borough Council have&nbsp;taken ownership of the former Heanor Grammar School building. This is excellent news for Heanor as&nbsp;for too long this building has sat empty at the heart of the town. Despite the building’s potential to elevate the local community, it has become an eyesore.</p>



<p>I have been calling for the building to be repurposed for years, so I was delighted to learn that the Council now plans to restore the building into a new &#8216;Heanor Hub&#8217;. The regenerated site&nbsp;will include a mixture of business space and community facilities for local residents, as well as potentially some leisure activities. The plans also aim to provide new parking and improve links with the Market Place and town centre. This is all being done through&nbsp;the Borough Council’s Future High Streets project, which combines £8.6 million of Government funding, as part of an overall £17.8 million town centre regeneration programme.</p>



<p>This&nbsp;project represents a fantastic opportunity to reinvigorate Heanor town centre after a particularly tough time during the pandemic. Local residents will be able to have their say on the draft plans&nbsp;of the former Heanor Grammar School through upcoming&nbsp;planned consultations and I will keep you updated in future newsletters.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong><u>Investing in local bus services:</u></strong></h2>



<p>Bus services form the backbone of our local transport network and I know&nbsp;that for many residents local buses are vital for getting around. However, bus services have been severely impacted by the pandemic and we also need to make it easier and more accessible to encourage more people to use local bus services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as part of a new Bus Service Improvement Programme, the Government recently announced the award of £47 million of funding over the next 3 years to&nbsp;Derbyshire County Council to maintain and improve our local bus services. The investment is intended to promote cheaper and easier ticketing and invest in bus services by improving information for passengers, investing in bus stops and shelters and making journeys more reliable through road network and traffic improvements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is welcome news for Amber Valley and the whole of&nbsp;Derbyshire and I will continue to push for local areas and services to benefit from this investment.</p>



<h2><strong><u>Visit to Alfreton Qualitrain Engineering:</u></strong></h2>



<p>Education and opportunities for young people in Amber Valley are subjects that are often raised when I speak to local residents. Specifically, the need for more vocational training and employment focused qualifications. It is for this reason that I was so pleased to open the new Qualitrain Engineering Academy in Alfreton, which is specifically designed to offer these opportunities.</p>



<p>The academy is set to offer hands-on apprenticeships to the next generation of engineering and manufacturing professionals. Offering apprenticeships in the form of Level 2 and 3 Improvement Standards in such courses as Engineering Technician, General Welder, Metal Fabricator, and Rail Engineering Technician.</p>



<p>It is clear to me that this is a great asset to add to our local community, and exactly the type of employment focused education we all want to see offered locally. I look forward to seeing the academy’s progress in the coming months.</p>

    <title>Queen’s Speech is a new low even for the Tories</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2022/05/queens-speech-is-a-new-low-even-for-the-tories/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;Chi Onwurah &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&amp;amp;memberId=4124"&gt;(Newcastle upon Tyne Central) (Lab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds East (Richard Burgon) and his passionate calls for action. I have become accustomed to feeling disappointment, dismay, despair and, at times, disgust in response to Government pronouncements, but this Queen’s Speech is a new low. The people of my constituency deserve better than this low-growth, high-tax and, increasingly, high-inflation Government. Under Labour we had growth on average of 2% each year, but under the Tories it is averaging 1.5% and is forecast to go negative. The cost of living crisis brought about by this Government has my constituents flocking to food banks. The choice between eating and heating is real in my constituency. Child poverty rates in the north-east rose by more than a third, to 37%, between 2015 and 2019. Some 61% of children in Elswick in my constituency are growing up in poverty—this is in 2022!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Government’s response? This Queen’s speech is remarkable for what is not in it, not what is: there is no emergency budget, with a windfall tax to get money off people’s bills, as Labour has called for; and it contains no employment Bill, although the Government promised one. We needed a real plan for growth to get our economy firing on all cylinders, with a climate investment pledge, and a commitment to buy, make and sell more in Britain. Instead, the Government hike national insurance; cut universal credit; have real-terms pay cuts for public sector workers; freeze the rate of local housing allowance; and freeze the cap on childcare costs that UC claimants are entitled to. Each of those decisions make it even harder for my constituents to deal with rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this Government do not believe that government can make a positive difference to people’s lives. That leaves my constituents with stagnating wages; the north-east regional economy without the investment it needs; hard-working Geordies facing massive technological and economic change without the skills they need; and the Tyne bridge peeling and our buses infrequent and overpriced. It does not have to be this way, because government can be a force for good. Governments can look ahead and plan—although not this Government, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to show how it can be different by looking at one Bill that was actually mentioned in the Queen’s Speech and that really highlights the point, and by looking at where the Government are creating growth: in online crime. Online, the Conservatives are the party of no law and total disorder. The Home Secretary did not even bother to defend her Government’s record when I challenged her earlier. I am an engineer and a passionate advocate for technology and innovation. It has truly distressed me to see technology go from being boring but useful to exciting but exploitative. Our constituents fear that tech is managing them, tracking, monitoring and analysing their every move, and then serving them up to be trolled, exploited, scammed, groomed or just bombarded with advertising and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online harms are not some future threat but an established current reality about which successive Conservative and Liberal Democrat Governments have done absolutely nothing, because they have believed in and, indeed, promoted the silicon valley libertarian lie that Governments could do nothing about the internet. They have thereby allowed monopolistic platforms to acquire more money and power than many Governments have. That power is used to deny workers’ rights in silicon valley and to delay and minimise regulation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successive Conservative and Liberal Democrat Governments chose to leave it to the market, blinded by their belief that the state was too slow or too stupid to regulate to keep people safe and secure online. They did that while actively cutting the parts of the state—such as the police and trading standards—the job of which it is to protect people. We now see the same dogmatic approach in the Government’s attitude to the cost of living. They refuse to take action, such as by introducing a windfall tax, and instead cut programmes, such as the green homes scheme—axed just six months after it was announced—that could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is possible for Governments to take action. The Labour Government at the time saw the fast-evolving communications landscape of the late ’90s, consulted widely and put in place forward-looking regulation in the form of the Communications Act 2003, which set out a regulatory landscape fit for the next decade. Come 2013, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government chose to ignore the many calls, from me and many others, to do something similar. It is no surprise that the former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister is now Facebook’s president of global affairs, justifying the online harms that deliver billions of pounds of revenue to that company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Online Safety Bill in the Queen’s Speech will not be in place before 2023, so Conservatives have left my constituents unprotected and insecure online for more than a decade. The much-delayed Bill still fails in so many ways. It fails to strengthen child protection across the entire internet; to properly address the harmful impact that social media can have on young people’s  mental health; and to ensure a voice to victims of abuse and harm online. The Bill needs to tackle disinformation online, and to close the loophole that means people are not properly protected from online fraud by ensuring that all platforms take a proactive approach to preventing scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data reform Bill, also in the Queen’s Speech, seems to be more about taking away protections than about giving new digital rights, and the digital markets Bill has no proper enforcer. This Government are constructing a piecemeal, ad hoc and, at times, kneejerk online legislative framework when what we need is a comprehensive, cross-departmental, evidence-based, forward-looking review of digital rights and responsibilities so that we can have a regulatory framework that is fit for the future. This is the security and the respect that the British public deserve in the digital age. It is also mind-numbingly depressing that the Government are repeating their mistakes of a decade ago, ignoring emerging harms, algorithms, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, bossware and data dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in the Bill that addresses the decentralisation inherent in web 3.0 reflected in the use of blockchain as part of the future architecture of the web. Although distributed ledger technology has many strengths, there is also a libertarian dogmatic view that the blockchain can replace regulation in Government. That is a lie, and the Government need to show that they understand that—but, clearly, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need more emphasis on people’s rights, on access to algorithms and their regulation. The metaverse poses significant risk to children, with virtual reality chatrooms allowing children to mix freely with adults. Labour has long campaigned for stronger online protections for children and the public in order to keep them safe, to protect their prosperity from scams and online fraud, to secure our democracy, and to ensure that everyone is treated with decency and respect. Governments can act. This one refuses to do so. To be competitive in the global age, we need to empower everyone to be confident digital citizens. That is an economic imperative. An investment now will bear fruit for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government have failed to rise to the challenge of the digital age, just as they failed to rise to the cost of living crisis, and failed to rise to the challenges of covid, of climate change, and of child poverty. They look at our northern cities and see problems to hide from, not opportunities for investment. Whether we are talking about short-term or long-term planning, this Government are failing. Britain deserves better and I look forward to a Labour Government who are on the people’s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Isles MP calls for action to improve inter-island patient travel arrangements</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/2022/05/12/isles-mp-calls-for-action-to-improve-inter-island-patient-travel-arrangements/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil is calling for joint working to radically improve patient travel arrangements between the islands.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has been contacted by Barra’s main care provider, Cobhair Bharraigh, who have informed him of a patient’s 41 hour return journey to an appointment in Stornoway which took 10 minutes, versus the 28 hours it might take to travel to and from Glasgow.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil is calling on NHS Western Isles, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and the Scottish Government to improve the travel arrangements for patients between Barra, Uist and Stornoway, to allow patients to get to hospital appointments in a timely and decent manner.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil: “Over the last number of years we’ve seen a degradation in the transport system in the Hebrides meaning it is now easier to go to Edinburgh or London or even Brussels faster than it is to go from one end of the Hebrides to the other.</p>



<p>“At the moment, people have unacceptably long journeys, of ferries, overnight stays and then a flight to get to Stornoway, then all day to wait to get a flight back with the hope it is not delayed so there is another overnight stay before getting home.</p>



<p>“For now, the fastest way to get to Stornoway from Barra is via Glasgow. Unfortunately, the difficulty there is that Loganair have been selling PSO seats to day-trippers which fills up the planes. Therefore, action has to be taken, either flying via Glasgow to get to Stornoway or instead using Glasgow hospitals to avoid the difficult journeys patients have had as highlighted by Barra’s Care organisation in a letter to members of parliament, the Comhairle and NHS Western Isles.”</p>

			<p>An opportunity was lost in the Queen’s Speech to create legislation which would make lying to Parliament, and the British people, a sackable offence for MPs.</p>
<p>I was taking part in a late night debate on the content of the Queen’s Speech and criticised the government for not doing enough to tackle inequalities or help people struggling with the cost of living.</p>
<p>In my speech, I said: “Where is the legislation that will build back trust and confidence in our politics and politicians? Legislation that reinforces politics is about public service, about serving our communities and our country, not ourselves or our mates. That addresses, not just the inequality in income and wealth but in power too, including in political power.</p>
<p>“Where is the legislation that would put the Ministerial Code on a statutory footing, as it is in the devolved nations, underpinned by the Nolan principles of selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and leadership, that would make lying to this House and to the people of this country, a sackable offence?”</p>
<p>As the Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Compassion in Politics, I believe we have to change the culture of our politics. Being an honourable member, whether a member of this chamber or of a local authority, should mean something. Our constituents must know we will act with integrity and decency, that we will be on their side.</p>

  <title>MP SAYS GOVERNMENT HAVE LEFT RURAL COMMUNITIES OUT IN THE COLD FOLLOWING QUEEN’S SPEECH</title>

  <summary type="text">On the floor of the House of Commons yesterday, South Lakes MP Tim Farron criticised the government for making no mention of rural communities or farmers and the issues they have been facing.
In his speech, Tim emphasised that farmers are on the front line of providing food to the nation and tackling the climate crisis simultaneously, but the government's current policies are jeopardising farmer's efforts to improve the climate.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On the floor of the House of Commons yesterday, South Lakes MP Tim Farron criticised the government for making no mention of rural communities or farmers and the issues they have been facing.</p>
<p>In his speech, Tim emphasised that farmers are on the front line of providing food to the nation and tackling the climate crisis simultaneously, but the government's current policies are jeopardising farmer's efforts to improve the climate.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"We should also care because our farmers are on the frontline of tackling climate change and providing environmental restoration.</em></p>
<p><em>"Some 70% of England's land mass is farmed, so if we care about tackling climate change and the biodiversity crisis, the reality is that the greenest thing that any Government can do is keep Britain's farmers farming.</em></p>
<p><em>"They are the only people who will make even the greatest plans come to fruition, because the greatest plans in the world will remain just plans in a drawer without farmers to introduce them."</em></p>
<p>Tim also discussed the transition to the new farm payment system outlining the fact that most farmers are now being left worse off under the new system. He said: <em>"In my constituency, every single farmer has lost at least 5% of their basic payments and will lose at least 20% this year. All of the hundreds of farms that I represent are in that position.</em></p>
<p><em>"This year, 13 of the farms that I represent-a tiny proportion, little more than 1%-will be getting anything from the new sustainable farming incentive. The Government's botched transition to the new scheme is costing farmers thousands of pounds a year, with nothing to replace it.</em></p>
<p><em>"So, what will happen? Farmers will either go bust or go backwards.</em></p>
<p><em>"If they do not go bust, they will go backwards and give up on doing any environmental work whatever; they will just get more stock, because that is the only way that they can keep food on their own table."</em></p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim again expressed his disappointment in the Government for their lack of attention to farmers: <em>"This Queen's speech is incredibly disappointing for us, no mention of rural communities or farmers is shocking, we have been neglected and taken advantage of time and time and again."</em></p>

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dunne Secures New Taskforce to tackle ’unacceptable’ delays in Shropshire NHS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the quarterly MPs’ briefing with local NHS Leaders on 29th April attended by Shropshire’s Conservative MPs, Philip Dunne suggested that a taskforce within the NHS in Shropshire be established urgently to tackle delays in patients attended to by ambulances responding to emergency calls.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ambulance response times are being severely impacted by handover delays at acute Hospitals in the county as has been well flagged in recent months. Mr Dunne has raised ambulance services with Government Ministers and held regular meetings with West Mercia Ambulance Services to hold them to account for the substandard service being provided.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;His call for a new taskforce to review the entire patient flow at Shropshire’s two principal hospitals, Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and The Princess Royal Hospital, is hoped to identify steps that can be taken in the immediate and longer term to eradicate the severe A&amp;E waiting times for those conveyed by ambulances for emergencies and tackling the delays in accessing treatment.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earlier this morning, Shropshire MPs and NHS Leaders met with Minster of State for Health, Ed Argar MP to draw these problems to his attention.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Dunne MP commented; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I am pleased that the Minister of State for Health, Ed Argar supported my suggestion to establish a dedicated taskforce within the NHS to tackle the unacceptable delays in patients being treated in Shropshire. A meeting is now being arranged later this month to review the progress of this taskforce.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Minister has also agreed to visit Shropshire in late June or early July to see for himself what measures are being taken to reduce patient waiting times and assess the progress being made.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  
    &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-75/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The House resumed on Tuesday 19th April, because Monday was a Bank Holiday, and I began by attending the UK Steel re-launch of the UK Steel Charter. The event brought together Government Ministers, MPs, steel producers, consumers, and other supply chain partners to discuss the issues of procurement, infrastructure, and steel’s place within it. The event celebrated new signatories, thanked existing ones, and attendees heard from organisations who support domestic supply chains and maximise social values achieved through procurement activities. But the manner by which public and private organisations source steel will fundamentally change in forthcoming years. We were told that the UK Government’s Transforming Public Procurement and Levelling Up white papers, and the Government’s Steel Procurement Task Force publications, commit to harness the power of public procurement to support jobs and local communities. The UK Steel Charter has encouraged this proactive approach for many years, and numerous public and private sector organisations, including BEIS, and devolved administrations have become supportive partners. MPs and Unions have a pivotal role in maximising opportunities and value for the steel sector. I pledged my continued support for the UK Steel Charter and my ongoing commitment for steel workers, employees, in every region of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, there were three Government statements in the Chamber: Global Migration Challenge (Rwanda Plan); Prime Minister’s Statement: Government Update; and BEIS Statement: Energy Security Strategy. The first statement was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel who set out her Government’s plan for immigration published in March 2021, which is based on three objectives – increase the fairness and efficiency to better protect those in genuine need of asylum, deter illegal and dangerous routes, breaking criminal smuggling networks, and remove those without a right to be in the UK. The Home Secretary set out the international agreement with Rwanda, which states that Rwanda is a state party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, operates the seven core UN human rights conventions, and has a strong system for refugee resettlement. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper disagreed and said that this statement was unworkable, shameful, and a desperate attempt to distract from the PM’s lawbreaking, and undermining the rule of law. It didn’t include costs of people transferred to Rwanda, but the Home Office had briefed that it might be £30,000 per person to cover 3 months accommodation, and that is three times the cost of dealing with an asylum case in the UK. Ms Cooper said that the top police chief and anti-slavery commissioner said that this agreement will make it harder to prosecute people traffickers. Former PM Theresa May stated that she did not support it for legal, practical and efficacy grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second statement was led by the PM who stated that on 12th April he received a fixed penalty notice (FPN) relating to an event in Downing Street on 19th June 2020, which he paid immediately, and offered a full apology to the British people, and today on the first sitting day after receiving the FPN he repeated his wholehearted apology to the House. He said that it did not occur to him then or subsequently that a gathering in the Cabinet room just before a vital meeting on Covid strategy could amount to a breach of the rules. The Leader of the Opposition, Keir Starmer MP, did not accept the PM’s assertions, and stated that the public has made up its mind and they do not believe a word the PM says. Many MPs questioned the PM during the 80 minute statement, and many read out heart-breaking stories of their constituents who had lost loved ones during Covid but had obeyed the rules that the PM had made, and consequently didn’t have the opportunity to visit, or pay their respects to loved ones who had died. In total, the PM apologised 35 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third statement was led by the Secretary of State for BEIS, Kwasi Kwarteng, who said that the UK Government’s energy security strategy provides a clear, long-term plan to accelerate transition from expensive fossil fuel prices set by global markets, and is based on well-constituted energy policy, security, affordability and sustainability. Mr Kwarteng quoted the Chancellor’s £9 billion support package, including a £150 council tax rebate, £200 energy rebate in October, and decarbonisation of people’s homes saving low-income families £300 per year. Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero Minister, Ed Miliband MP, disagreed and said that it’s all hype, promises, and fails to live up to the scale of the energy crisis that families are facing, and once again the UK Government cannot deliver what the national interest demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Online Safety Bill Second Reading was led by the Secretary of State DCMS Nadine Dorries, and was debated for two and a half hours, but was not pushed to a division. Therefore, the Bill was carried over for the Committee Stage, following the Queen’s Speech which will take place on 11th May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I attended a drop in event to support the Fan-Led review of football governance organised by Fair Game UK to show that we must build a future for football that puts financial sustainability, good governance, equality standards, and fan community engagement, at the heart of football in the UK. I met former England International John Scales and Niall Cooper, the CEO of Fair Game who have both been instrumental in campaigning for reform after the failure of the European Super League. Football fans must play a central role in reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also dropped in to the RNIB and LEGO Group event to celebrate their amazing initiative to develop LEGO Braille Bricks to help young people who have vision impairment to learn braille. This is a concept that is a play-based methodology which teaches braille to children who are blind or visually impaired. Each brick retains its iconic form, but the studs are arranged to correspond with numbers and letters of the Braille alphabet. Each brick also shows the printed version of the symbol or letter, so that sighted and blind children can play and learn on equal terms. Over the past 15 months RNIB has delivered training to 800 teaching professionals and distributed 2,000 sets of bricks to 220 Local Authorities. I met with teachers and students who have benefited from using the LEGO Braille Bricks and took the opportunity to try out the bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the TSB’s “Tackling Fraud Together” event and report launch which is campaigning for better protections for consumers against fraud. Online fraud has a significant impact on the cost of living for many families in the UK. Research by TSB found that in Wales 26% of people would not be able to afford food, and 21% would not afford their rent or mortgage, for one week, if they lost up to £500 through fraud. 53% of the claims seen by TSB are for less than £500, and I’m supporting TSB in their call for stronger action from the public and private sector to protect people from fraud. TSB has refunded 97% of fraud claims since April 2019 compared to the rest of the banking sector which has refunded less than 50%. I’m calling on other banks to refund more fraud victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the Lords Amendments to the Subsidy Control Bill, the Building Safety Bill, and the Nationality and Borders Bill were debated in the Commons Chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for BEIS, Paul Scully MP, led the first Bill, and the UK Government accepted all the Lords Amendments, apart from 46, which were then agreed to by Members without pushing to a division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour supported the following Lords Amendments regarding the Building Safety Bill when they returned to the Commons:&lt;br&gt;
Amendment 8: major concerns about safety in buildings should be addressed in a timely way.&lt;br&gt;
115: extended the cost protections to leaseholders in buildings of all heights containing two or more residential dwellings.&lt;br&gt;
117: ensured that leaseholders in enfranchised buildings are not excluded from protection.&lt;br&gt;
155: reduced the maximum amount leaseholders could be made liable for fire remediation to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the UK Government were successful in opposing all these Lords Amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a Government concession on Labour Lord’s Amendment 22 which ensured that social housing providers are exempt from the additional financial burden of the Government’s proposed levy, ensuring that council tenants would not subsidise the failures of private developers, and will be enacted through Secondary Legislation. There were 250 Government Lord’s amendments agreed without divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We voted on 12 Lords Amendments to the Nationality and Borders Bill when they returned to the Commons late Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amendment 4B removed the retrospective power of the Secretary of State so that any existing deprivation orders given without notice would have to be reissued through the lawful process in the Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5B ensured that nothing in the Bill authorises policies or decisions which do not comply with the Refugee Convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6B ensured that refugees which have been separated into 2 groups, based on whether or not they have passed through a safe third country, should have the equal entitlements. They will be given Convention and family reunion rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7B provided asylum seekers with a right to work whilst they are still waiting for a decision after 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8B ensured that inadmissibility rules cannot be commenced until there are safe return agreements in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;53B-D removed offshore processing of asylum seekers from the Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10B replaced family reunion rules lost under the Dublin III scheme and provided a route for unaccompanied children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11B provided that the Secretary of State published a target for refugee resettlement each year and put in place resourcing and infrastructure to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13B provided that it is only an offence if someone arrives in the UK in breach of a deportation order, rather than criminalising anyone who arrives without clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20B ensured that anyone rescuing lives at sea would be protected from prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25B narrowed the prosecution of those identified as a “threat to public order” to those convicted of terrorist offences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26B put in place 12 months of support for victims of modern slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Government defeated all these Lords Amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the opposition parties tabled and the House debated a censure motion entitled “Referral of Prime Minister to Committee of Privileges”, which contained: fixed penalty notices in relation to events in 10 Downing St; assertions made by the PM with regard to – the legality of these activities under Covid regulations; that no parties and no regulations were broken; appeared to mislead the House; and that this should be referred to the Privileges Committee to consider whether the PM’s conduct amounted to contempt of the House, but that this should not begin until inquiries by the Metropolitan Police have concluded. Sir Keir Starmer MP opened the debate and Angela Rayner MP closed the debate on behalf of the Opposition. The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General Michael Ellis MP wound up the debate for the Government. Angela said that she hoped it was the last time that the Minister was wheeled out to defend the indefensible, and that members from across the House have spoken about the heart-wrenching sacrifices their constituents made throughout the pandemic, and about the principles of integrity, honesty, and dignity, which are at stake. She also stated that the debate is a historic moment and it’s about the crucial question of whether the PM intentionally misled the House. The Minister said that the PM has made it clear that he is happy to face whatever inquiries Parliament sees fit, and he is happy for the House to decide how to proceed, so the Tories were not whipped, but free to vote. He also stated that the Government Amendment was tabled last night because it wanted Sue Gray to publish her report without delay and the Metropolitan Police to conclude their investigations, but now recognise that these will happen, so the Government is happy for the Labour Motion to go through. The Minister said that the PM has apologised repeatedly for what has happened. He has asked for the House’s forgiveness and should be allowed to get on with serving the country. The debate lasted for over 5 hours and, as the Minister said, the UK Government did not oppose the motion and it passed without a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government also announced that it anticipated that Parliament will be prorogued on Thursday 28th April and will be resumed on Tuesday 11th May, when the Queen will make a speech opening the new Parliamentary session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday 23rd May I was honoured and humbled to join many people from the local community who attended the Ukrainian Vigil in Ynysfach Primary School. A committee made up from Resolven Community Council, the ladies from the Welfare Club, and local residents was set up to organise the Vigil, which took place in the school yard. The pupils had made Ukrainian banners and flags with which they had decorated the yard, and they joined in the Vigil. Neal Francis, the Chairman and Mayor of Resolven Community Council introduced the speakers, including a local resident from Tonna who has family in Ukraine and is raising funds to send over much needed supplies including medical equipment; Jeremy Miles gave an update on Welsh Government support; and Reverend Jane Shaw said prayers and a blessing. We listened to the Black Eyed Peas song for Ukraine “Where is the Love” and the Ukrainian anthem. After the very emotional Vigil, we attended a fund-raising buffet where all the food was made by the WI, and held in Building Blocks Family Centre, hosted by the centre manager Ceri Pritchard. The local shops and clubs had sold ribbons, held raffles and collections. The total raised was an amazing £1196.66. Slava Ukraina. Slava Resolven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last week of the current Parliamentary session started on Monday 25th April. The business in the Chamber was – UK Government statements, Urgent Questions, and Lords Amendments returning to the Commons, to be voted down by the UK Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 3.30pm on Monday, The Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace MP, updated the House on Ukraine. He said that it is 61 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and 74 days since his Russian counterpart assured him that Russia would not invade. The UK Government assessed that 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed, over 2,000 armoured vehicles, 60 helicopters and fighter jets, have been destroyed or captured. Last week the Russians admitted that the Moskva had sunk, and the Russians have refocused to try and capture Donetsk, Luhansk, Donbas, and connect with Crimea via Mariupol. The Minister listed the support he had given Ukraine: 5,000 anti-tank missiles; 5 air defence systems; 1,360 anti-structure munitions and 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives. Also, 90,000 ration packs, 10 pallets of medical equipment, 3,000 pieces of body armour, 77,000 helmets, and 3,000 pairs of boots. The Minister stated that the PM had announced another £100 million of high grade equipment and the Minister said that Stormer vehicles will also be gifted to Ukraine. He said that the next three weeks would be key, and the UK is working with Canada, US, and EU, and that NATO is reassessing how it can deter and defend against threats. The Minister quoted the President of Ukraine who said that if Russia stops fighting there will be peace – if Ukraine stops fighting there will be no more Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next statement was the UK Government’s response to the Fan Led Review of Football Governance delivered by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nigel Huddleston MP, but before he called the Minister, Mr Speaker yet again voiced his disappointment that the UK Government had already released its response to the media the night before. Mr Speaker said that it was discourteous to the House and to Tracey Crouch MP who had chaired the review, and had put so much work into this and she has been cut out, but the Speaker would give her more time to speak in the statement. The Minister said that his Government endorsed all 10 strategic recommendations set out in the review, and would Implement its responsibilities, but the football authorities should implement theirs too. The UK Government also published the findings of a study by Kieran Maguire and Christina Philippou, which confirmed there is a widespread issue of fragile finances across English Football Clubs. The Minister said that the UK Government would publish a White Paper in the summer which will set out details of implementing the recommendations, including a new financial regulation regime, an independent regulator, a new directors and owners test, a minimum level of fan engagement, fans consent before changing stadium, colours, and badge, protection of players welfare, and the UK Government will implement these reforms as soon as possible. The Minister said that the Premier League should strengthen its support through the football pyramid. The Minister said that the UK Government will also launch a dedicated review of women’s football, and that the FIFA Women’s World Cup, and UEFA European Women’s final will be made available to free-to-air broadcasters. Tracey Crouch MP welcomed the UK Government’s endorsement, but said she was concerned about the timeframe for implementation, and asked the Minister to clarify: what does summer mean; will he rule out housing the independent regulator in the FA; will the owners and directors test be split into 2; does he share her disappointment that no progress has been made on discussions between football authorities regarding redistribution and parachute payments; what is his position on the transfer solidarity levy; and will there be a veto for fans on heritage matters. The Minister said that he would bring back further information about: the definition of “summer”; the home for the regulator; financial distribution agreement; and the precise nature of fan engagement and heritage assets in the forthcoming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate on consideration of the Lords Message for the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill followed the statements, and we voted to support the Lords Amendments. The first Lords Amendment group 73, 74 ABCDEFG, and 87 ABCDEFH, removed provisions for police to impose conditions on “noisy” protests, and in-person impact to people in the vicinity of protests – defined as intimidation, harassment, serious unease, serious alarm, and serious distress. We lost by 300-220 votes. The second Lords Amendment group 80 ABCDEFH removed provisions for police to impose conditions on public assemblies, and static protests. We lost by 302-221 votes.&lt;br&gt;
The next debate considered the Lords Amendments for the Health and Care Bill. We voted on Lords Amendment 29B which required workforce projections to be published every three years rather than two years, to reduce the bureaucratic burden, replacing Lords Amendment 29 which we lost last week. We again lost by 278-182 votes. We voted on Lords Amendment 80 which removed the clause relating to a cap of £86,000 on social care costs, and also stated that Local Authority contributions would not count towards the cap. Lords Amendments 80P and Q ensured that the cap cannot be brought in until results of the Trailblazer pilots schemes have been evaluated. We lost by 282-183 votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning I joined the AGM of the Environment All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) and was re-elected as one of the vice-chairs. The Green Alliance was confirmed to continue as the secretariat. Rt Hon Chris Skidmore MP, who was the UK Government Minister who signed net zero into law, was elected as chair. We discussed the work and events programme for the next twelve months, including meetings on energy security with the Minister for Business, Energy and Clean Growth, Greg Hands MP, environment land management with the Minister for Farming, Fisheries, and Food, Victoria Prentice MP, and CBD COP15 with the Minister for the Pacific and International Environment, Lord Goldsmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I chaired the Fifth Delegated Legislation Committee which debated The Industrial Training Levy (Construction Industry Training Board) Order 2022. This instrument will enable the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) to raise and collect a levy on employers in the construction industry. The levy funds the expenses of the CITB in carrying out its functions encouraging training in the industry under the Industrial Training Act 1982. The purpose is to address market failure in the development and maintenance of skills in the construction industry. A previous instrument in 2018 allowed levies to be collected in 2018, 2019, 2020, but the 2021 instrument allowed for a one year levy to halve the 2018 rate in response to the pandemic. The instrument debated in this committee allowed the rates to return to the 2018 levy, and extended it for the levy periods ending in 2022, 2023, and 2024. The increased threshold for small employers remained unchanged. I called on the Minister, Alex Burghart MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Apprenticeships and Skills, to open the debate by moving the motion, but he only managed to read the title of the motion, when the division bells rang, and I had to suspend the debate so that members of the committee could vote on Lords amendments of the Judicial Review and Courts Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour abstained on Lords Amendments 1 and 5, and voted to support Lords Amendment 11, which introduced a new entitlement for bereaved persons to receive publicly funded representation in inquests where public bodies are legally represented (Hillsborough Law) and we lost by 299-168 votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resumed the Delegated Legislation Committee after all the votes had taken place. The Minister moved the motion and opened the debate. The Opposition Spokesperson Toby Perkins MP responded and asked the Minister questions, but did not oppose the instrument, which was passed without a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Government added the Nationality and Borders Bill to the end of Tuesday’s business. Starting at 10.30pm we voted again on three of the Lords Amendments that we had voted to support last week when we were defeated by the UK Government and sent back to the Lords for “ping-pong” (when Lords Amendments to a UK Government Bill are voted down in the Commons and sent back to the Lords to be re-amended or conceded). Labour again supported Lords Amendment 5D, losing 296-206; Lords Amendment 6DEF losing 299-205; and Lords Amendment 7FG losing 288-212. These amendments were then sent back to the Lords for them to decide whether to concede defeat on these amendments or send them back to the Commons for more ping-pong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I joined the APPG on Rare, Genetic and Undiagnosed Conditions for Undiagnosed Children’s Day (29th April). Approximately 6,000 children are born every year with a genetic condition likely to remain undiagnosed. There are multiple factors which stop someone from receiving a diagnosis, for example, some people may not be able to access tests to identify their condition, while others may have a condition so rare it is yet to be discovered. We heard from two speakers: Marie Pritchard, representative from SWAN UK, which is run by the Genetic Alliance UK Charity and provides 24/7 support for its members, on her experience of having a child with “a syndrome with no name” and Nick Meade, Joint Interim Chief Executive and Director of Policy at Genetic Alliance UK, who spoke on the findings from the Good Diagnosis report which underlies the importance of diagnosis for people living with rare conditions and sets out some guiding principles for diagnosis: increasing awareness of rare conditions among healthcare professionals; people with rare conditions should receive information and support throughout their diagnosis; and a good diagnosis patient rights charter should be developed. I asked Nick what he thought of the Welsh Government Rare Diseases Implementation Plan and he said that it was clear, ambitious, and achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elections Bill came back to the Commons on Wednesday night for some “ping-pong”. Labour has advocated that voting is safe and secure in Britain and Ministers should be promoting confidence in our elections, rather than threatening our democracy, by proposing a voting ID system taken from the Republican Party Playbook. In the 2019 General Election, there was one prosecution for voter impersonation out of over 59 million votes. Three and a half million people of the UK electorate do not have access to any form of photo ID. We saw the severe consequences of the Windrush scandal when communities struggled to provide official documentation. Labour supported Lords Amendments 22 and 23 tabled by Lord Judge which removed clauses that make provision for a power to designate a “Strategy and Policy Statement” for the Electoral Commission which will be drafted by the Government, and will undermine the independence of the Commission. Amendment 22 was defeated by 306-215 votes, and Amendment 23 was defeated by 306-213 votes. Labour supported Lords Amendment 86 tabled by Lord Willets, which added a list of documents that would be accepted as a form of identification for electors voting at polling stations, many of which are non-photographic, but this was defeated 306-213. Parliamentary protocol stipulates that because I chaired the Committee Stage of the Elections Bill I was not allowed to vote on the other stages of this Bill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ARTICLE: I Won’t Give Up on Unfair Energy Prices</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/article-energy-prices/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=article-energy-prices" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content"&gt;&lt;div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The UK Parliament was prorogued last week, marking the end of this Parliamentary term. As is the way at Westminster, there is a lot of pomp and ceremony attached to the process, but, in short, prorogation allows the Government to reset parliamentary business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Parliament will recommence on the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May, with the Queen&amp;#8217;s Speech marking the beginning of the new legislative session. At this point, we learn the bills the Government intends to pursue over the course of the next session of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Readers may recall that Boris Johnson was found to have illegally prorogued Parliament during the Brexit negotiations. He used this process to avoid scrutiny by MPs of his Government&amp;#8217;s Brexit deal – which resulted in him having to make a formal apology to the Queen. At the time, it was almost unthinkable that any Prime Minister would act to bring their own Government into disrepute. Now we know it was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before the end of Parliament, my Energy Pricing (Off Gas Grid Households) Bill was published. If passed, the bill would oblige the UK Government to act to ensure households do not have to pay more for energy because they do not have access to mains gas supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The current energy price cap is based on the assumption that households across the nations of the UK consume energy with a split of 80% gas and 20% electricity. However, about one in six homes across the nations of the UK are currently off the gas grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The end of the parliamentary session means this bill will fall, along with many others. I will keep on the issue in the new parliamentary session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last week, I also presented Highland News Media&amp;#8217;s petition on unfair electricity charges to 10 Downing Street. It was great to see so much support across the Highlands to end these unfair charges and rest assured, I will continue to work on this issue on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before I sign off, I want to take this opportunity to wish all the candidates standing for  election to the Highland Council well. Whatever separates us in politics, we all want to see the best for our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To everyone else – don&amp;#8217;t forget to vote this Thursday to elect your local Councillors. If you have a postal vote and haven&amp;#8217;t filled it out yet, there is still time, and it can be returned to the polling station on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong>Home Office granted right to live in UK through tier 1 scheme to 46 people aged 21 or under, FoI request reveals</strong></p>



<p>Anti-corruption campaigners and MPs have warned that “the kids of oligarchs” may have used their parents’ money to buy the right to live in the UK after it was revealed that the government granted “golden visas” to 46 people aged 21 or under.</p>



<p>The Home Office on Wednesday disclosed that it approved 46 applications for the tier 1 investor visa scheme to those aged 21 or under over the last seven years, following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-04/gen-z-millionaires-buying-golden-visas-in-the-u-k-raises-alarm">a freedom of information request from Bloomberg</a>.</p>



<p>The golden visa scheme – which was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/london-laundromat-how-golden-visa-scheme-created-uk-haven-for-dirty-money">scrapped in February over fears that it had been exploited by Russian oligarchs</a>&nbsp;– was designed to attract wealthy people to the UK and required applicants to invest at least £2m.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thousands used it to secure fast-track rights to live and work in Britain, and the scheme was particularly popular with Russian and Chinese families.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/john-penrose">John Penrose, a Conservative MP who serves as “the prime minister’s anti-corruption champion”</a>, said the revelation raised concerns that golden visas could have been “a loophole for kleptocrats’ children to live gilded lives in London funded by dirty money”.</p>



<p>He added: “If golden visas were granted to the brightest and best young entrepreneurs, Britain will have benefited hugely from the jobs, energy and wealth which they will have created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The answer is for the government to publish its long-promised review of golden visas, so we can see what really happened and when. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, as the saying goes.”</p>



<p>It was previously revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/russian-oligarchs-on-uk-sanctions-list-were-granted-golden-visas">eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin</a>&nbsp;were also granted golden visas to live in Britain. The Home Office has declined to name the sanctioned individuals who were given visas, and who Johnson described as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”.</p>



<p>Dr Susan Hawley, the executive director of <a href="https://www.spotlightcorruption.org/">Spotlight on Corruption</a>, said the latest revelation of potential abuse of the golden visa scheme was “deeply concerning”.</p>



<p>“Due to a loophole in the golden visa regime, there were little to no checks on the source of wealth if the money was gifted to the person applying for the visa,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This means the kids of oligarchs may have used their parents’ money, possibly obtained through corruption, to secure UK residency, exemplifying yet again how the regime facilitated the flow of dirty money into the UK.Advertisement</p>



<p>“The government urgently needs to publish a report on the national security risks golden visas posed, so that there is a fuller understanding of these risks, and appropriate action is taken.”</p>



<p>Launched in 2008, but with its origins in an investor route dating back to 1994, the scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights along with their family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The speed with which applicants were given indefinite leave to remain was hastened by how much money they planned to invest in the UK: £2m took five years, while £10m – a higher option introduced in 2011 – shortened the wait to two years.</p>



<p>After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors who were awarded visas from 2008 to 2015. The review has yet to be published.</p>



<p>During a “blind faith period” between 2008 and 2015, 97% of investors were subject to scant checks on the legitimacy of their wealth leading to concerns about undesirable people slipping into the country, say critics.</p>



<p>According to Spotlight on Corruption, 6,312 golden visas – half the number of all those issued – had been reviewed for “possible national security risks”.</p>



<p>Duncan Hames, director of policy at the anti-corruption campaign group&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/">Transparency International UK</a>, said: “Media investigations, court cases and the occasional snippet from ministers have shed some light on the pasts of some visa recipients, but we are still largely in the dark about the true extent of abuse of the scheme.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office">Home Office</a>&nbsp;should publish its long-overdue review, with individual cases investigated where there are concerns that the applicants made their money through crime or corruption. Only through some genuine openness can we hope enough people will learn from the mistakes of the past.”</p>



<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have made it clear we will not tolerate abuse of our immigration system and we closed the tier 1 (investor) route to ensure those who have profited from dirty money cannot gain access to the UK.</p>



<p>“The new Economic Crime Act, which received royal assent after an expedited passage through parliament, delivers a package of measures to bring tougher sanctions against those who facilitate illicit finance in the UK and empowers law enforcement to investigate entities who do not comply.”</p>

    <title>Local MP Visits Oaklands College</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.shapps.com/local-mp-visits-oaklands-college/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=local-mp-visits-oaklands-college" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local MP Grant Shapps visited Oaklands College in Welwyn Garden City following an&lt;br&gt;“Introduction to Your UK Parliament” engagement workshop on campus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the visit to a bustling Oaklands Campus, the Welwyn Hatfield MP took questions from&lt;br&gt;students, who were keen to hear his views on a range of issues, and to learn more about the&lt;br&gt;work of MPs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Students used the opportunity to ask Mr Shapps about what inspired him to get into politics, as&lt;br&gt;well as issues that impacted them locally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to an extensive Q&amp;amp;A with students, Mr Shapps toured the college with Principal&lt;br&gt;Andrew Slade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair discussed many aspects of the college, including its development plans and proud&lt;br&gt;record of producing national-level athletes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When speaking about the visit Mr Shapps said, “it was fantastic to see so many young people&lt;br&gt;with such a burning interest in politics, and as I said during the visit, they should get involved at&lt;br&gt;all levels &amp;#8211; whether that be through campaigning, debating, or even standing for office&lt;br&gt;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I hope many of those in the room today were inspired &amp;#8211; just as I was as a younger person &amp;#8211; to&lt;br&gt;take up the mantle and stand up for what they believe in, regardless of political persuasion.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following Mr Shapps’ comments, Mr Slade added, “I’d like to say a massive thank you to Grant&lt;br&gt;for taking the time to come to Oaklands and talk to our students about Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was great for them to hear first-hand all about the work of an MP, especially a Cabinet&lt;br&gt;Minister, and how Parliament operates.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with one of my regular updates about local issues.</p>
<h2>Chalk Pit</h2>
<p>Firstly the latest on the Chalk Pit in Epsom.</p>
<p>I am waiting for news as to whether the controversial retrospective planning application will be called in by the Government. This does not normally happen if a local authority has given permission for a development, but I am hoping that this case will be different. If it is called in, there will be a proper enquiry into the situation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the business which has been causing most of the problems has been sold and is moving its operation off the site. Unfortunately another firm has been using the site as well, and is now applying to take over the permit for the site. As this firm were ordered to leave a previous site in Morden because of noise and dust pollution, I am strongly opposing the granting of a licence to them. After representations from myself and local residents, the Environment Agency has agreed to treat the application as a matter of high public interest which means it will be subject to a much more detailed investigation and consultation than would normally be the case.</p>
<p>In addition I met the Chief Executive of the Environment Agency before Easter to discuss the problems at the Chalk Pit and I am hopeful that the Agency will now be more robust in its approach to dealing with the noise and dust nuisance there. I know that the high level of nuisance has been continuing and will do all I can to hold them to the promises that they are now making.</p>
<h2>Southern &amp; Southwestern Rail Services</h2>
<p>I have also met the Chief Executives of our two local rail companies to protest about the poor levels of service at the moment. On the Southern Route I have been promised additional trains from Epsom to London Bridge, but I am pushing for them to go south of Epsom as well as the service from Ashtead and further down in Mole Valley is not good enough at the moment.</p>
<p>With SWR I am in particular pushing for additional trains from Ewell West, Stoneleigh and Worcester Park in the peak as crowding levels are clearly now bad again. In particular the service after 8am is much too thin. I will update you when I get a response from them.</p>
<h2>New Hospital Sutton</h2>
<p>I have been asked by some local residents what is happening about the potential new hospital at Sutton. This has clearly been delayed by the pandemic, but I understand that a planning application is due in the coming months. I do not expect the new facility to be open until the second half of the decade, though. For now I do not expect any change to local services.</p>
<h2>Citizens Advice Drop in Hours</h2>
<p>The Citizens Advice team in Epsom have restarted their drop in service at their office in the Old Town Hall after closing it during the pandemic. The service can offer you help and guidance about a range of issues, including benefits, housing, debt, fuel poverty, family issues</p>
<p>The service is available as follows:</p>
<p>Monday – Friday                  10am – 4pm   Adviceline Telephone service</p>
<p>Tuesday (from 17<sup>th</sup> May)    10am – 1pm    Drop in service</p>
<p>Thursday                               10am – 3pm   Drop in service</p>
<p>Address: Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell, The Old Town Hall, The Parade, Epsom KT18 5AG</p>
<p>Adviceline:      0808 278 7963 (free to call)</p>
<p>Email:              <a href="mailto:office@caee.org.uk">office@caee.org.uk</a></p>
<h2>Appeal for Former Scouts</h2>
<p>Finally an appeal for former Scouts in the area.</p>
<p><em>3<sup>rd</sup> Epsom Scout Group is celebrating its 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. Based in the Scout Hall behind St John Chandler Hall on Church Road (just off East Street), we are the oldest continuously running Scout Group in the area</em></p>
<p><em>Did you attend Beavers, Cubs, Scouts or Explorers with the Group when you were younger? Did your children go there? Did you volunteer as a leader there? If so, we would love to hear from you. </em></p>
<p><em>This summer we are holding an event to celebrate our centenary and would love to have old members and other friends of the Group join us. If you have any memories or photos of your time in Beavers, Cubs, Scouts or Explorers, we’d also love to hear from you.</em></p>
<p><em>To join our alumni mailing list and find out more about how we’re celebrating, go to:</em><em> <u><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/F71jCJy3mcqqDPROCVL4Un?domain=3rdepsom.org.uk">https://www.3rdepsom.org.uk/Alumni.html</a></u></em></p>

    <title>Preet demands emergency budget, as figures reveal Brits could spend £10bn extra annually on soaring petrol prices </title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, has called on government to act over the spiralling cost of living crisis with an emergency budget, as figures show the impact of soaring petrol prices on families across Quinton, Harborne, Edgbaston and Bartley Green.</p>
<p>New analysis by Labour has revealed that families in Birmingham and across the country will fork out an extra £10bn on petrol, compared to just this time last year. </p>
<p>The Chancellor made a 5p fuel duty cut the centrepiece of his plan to tackle the cost-of-living. However, it has been entirely overshadowed by skyrocketing fuel costs that have increased prices by as much as 47p/litre in the last year, according to the RAC. </p>
<p>The figures come as oil and gas producers, including Shell and BP, took in billions in profits, with BP hailing “more money than we know what to do with”. </p>
<p>Labour today reiterated its call on the government to bring forward an emergency budget to tackle the Tory cost of living crisis. This would prioritise five measures including with a one-off windfall tax on the soaring profits of oil and gas producers to help households through the crisis with up to £600 in support. Labour would also ramp up home insulation, scrap the unfair National Insurance hike, and provide support for struggling businesses.  </p>
<p>Commenting Preet Kaur Gill said: “This is a savage extra cost for working people, particularly given the tax hike to national insurance that people across our city will be facing this week as they open their pay packets. It is outrageous that the Chancellor has raised taxes 15 times – costing families over £1000 this year.  </p>
<p>“The Conservative Government needs to set out an emergency budget to tackle their cost-of-living crisis and support Labour’s call that would put money back in the pockets of working people.  </p>
<p>“Labour’s plan would help households through this crisis with up to £600 cut off energy bills and turbocharge our transition to clean transport so never again are the British people left so exposed to unstable foreign oil.” </p>
<p><strong>ENDS</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notes to editors: </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Labour has called on the government to bring forwarded an emergency budget – and prioritise five measures that could be enacted now, to make a material difference to the millions of pensioners and working people feeling the crunch from the crisis: </p>
<p>  </p>
<ol start="1"><li>
	Put a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut home energy bills: Bring in a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits, to cut household bills by up to £600, including through a VAT cut on home energy bills and an increase and expansion of the Warm Homes Discount.  
	</li>

	Provide support for struggling businesses: Labour would cut taxes for businesses by giving SMEs a discount on their business rates bill worth up to £5,700 this year, funded by a tax on the online giants. We’d also bring in a £600 million contingency fund, raised by the windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits, for those industries and businesses struggling the most with rising bills like steel and other energy-intensive firms.

<p>Last week Boris Johnson became the only Prime Minister in British history to be found guilty of breaking the law. On Tuesday he made a statement to the House of Commons on the fines issued to himself and the Chancellor as a result of attending an illegal gathering in Westminster.</p>
<p>His mealy-mouthed apology will have offered little comfort to those families in Leicester West who sacrificed so much to follow the rules. You can see the Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, respond to the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement in the video above or read his response <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-04-19/debates/2C3E878D-6ECB-4FF2-9E3A-7B134989EAA6/EasterRecessGovernmentUpdate#contribution-2FDFBE6F-A5E1-434C-96DE-137D0F985771">here.</a></p>
<p>Labour will force a vote this week on allowing a cross-party committee to investigate whether the Prime Minister misled Parliament about breaking covid rules. Conservative MPs should put the country first, and vote to support an investigation. You can see the motion Labour have tabled on this <a href="https://labourlist.org/2022/04/motion-calling-for-investigation-of-pm-over-misleading-parliament-published/">here</a></p>
<p>The Labour Party is clear. Britain deserves better than Boris Johnson. It&#8217;s time to bring decency, honesty and integrity back to our politics. The Prime Minister is not fit to govern. He must resign.</p>

    <title>We must break our dependence on hostile foreign governments</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/we-must-break-our-dependence-on-hostile-foreign-governments/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Households across the country are reeling from the monumental April energy price cap rise. As of April. the average family must now find an extra £700 per year to cover rocketing energy costs, a crippling rise which the Bank of England say is the single biggest shock since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to that increasing fuel and food costs, and the Chancellor’s hike to National Insurance, the bottom line is that even more families are going to have to choose between heating their homes or eating, all when energy companies are posting record profits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces are attacking peaceful Ukrainian villages, towns and cities with missiles and bombs which are killing innocent civilians, including children. As I said to the Prime Minister during recent questions, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Putin continues to appal most of the world and shames the rest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while Britain plays its part in supporting Ukraine against Putin’s invasion, the situation has also shed a stark light on our economic reliance on energy and investment from hostile foreign governments. It is a dependence we need to break.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a Member of Parliament, my first duty is to ensure the safety and security of our nation and its people. Ensuring that we have proper control of our own energy and infrastructure – the very things we need to keep our country running – is a fundamental issue of national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I called on the Prime Minister to double our production targets for domestically produced hydrogen to reduce our dependence on foreign fossil fuels and improve our energy resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister agreed with me when he said “that’s exactly what we should be doing”. However, these words must be followed by government action to ensure our energy infrastructure and so much more is secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, I have presented my bill to Parliament to tackle the anti-social use of quads by giving police the powers they need to be able to track, seize and destroy illegally used quads, and to make wearing of helmets a legal requirement. I will be meeting with ministers in the coming weeks as I continue to push the government to change the law. I have also called for a wider debate to properly discuss the issue. As we move into summer, nuisance quads will become more of a problem as the days get longer and the weather improves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will also be our first summer in several years where we can properly enjoy outdoor festivals and concerts. These events were a growing industry before the pandemic and will doubtless be hugely popular now restrictions have ended. However, I am deeply concerned by the sheer scale of under reported spiking at these events and the lack of focus on tackling these terrible crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More disturbingly, the support offered to victims of spiking, who are predominately women and young girls, is often inadequate. Medical tents focus on life-saving care and offer no continuity of care or proper safeguarding, while security services are, frankly, often there to protect the venue, and not the festival-goers. On top of that, police recording of incidents at these events is patchy, with no central collection of crimes as part of official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combine this with the fact that those under 18 are allowed to attend often overnight without adult supervision, in a place where they lack their usual support networks, creates a huge safeguarding blind spot that leaves them vulnerable to predatory behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This needs to change. I am working with West Yorkshire Police, government and other agencies to find a solution to further protect young people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe an intervention is needed that requires festivals to have a robust safeguarding plan in place to deal with spiking and sexual assault before they are granted a license. There needs to be better security on these sites and improved staff training to recognise the signs of spiking, as well as specialist medical and support services that means young girls and women can receive continuing care. We also need effective national recording and tougher sentences for these vile crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is great news that Bradford has made it to the final four in the competition to be the UK’s City of Culture 2025. It is a spectacular opportunity to showcase the many brilliant, cultural exports that we know makes Bradford the ideal candidate to win this competition. I have always been outspoken in my belief that sport is one of Bradford’s greatest cultural assets, including the legendary Bradford Bulls in my own constituency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m working with Bradford Council, the Bradford Bulls and others to pull together a levelling-up bid to Government that will put sport and Odsal at the heart of Bradford South’s regeneration plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What better way would there be to celebrate the sporting and cultural potential of Bradford than to become the UKs City of Culture in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;

Money they can get to where it is needed through their Rotary International network, &amp; many thanks to everyone who has contributed. </p>

Perjudian online yang sederhana, dengan cepat menjadi industri multi-miliar dolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada sejumlah situs judi online yang menyediakan layanan hiburan dan perjudian kepada pengguna dari setiap bagian dunia. Di sini kita melihat manfaat utama yang bisa Anda dapatkan dari perjudian online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faktor utama dalam pertumbuhan industri perjudian online adalah kenyamanan. Anda dapat memainkan game favorit anda kapan saja dan dari mana saja. akan tetapi masih banyak orang lebih suka bermain dari kenyamanan rumah mereka di mana mereka merasa paling santai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone dan laptop memiliki dampak yang signifikan juga. Bahkan ada penelitian yang dilakukan tentang kapan pengguna paling suka berjudi online. Hasilnya tampaknya mengarah ke waktu sela seperti saat bepergian, menunggu teman, atau membuat janji.  dan juga meningkatkan popularitas karena banyak penjudi yang rajin bermain game saat istirahat di kantor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semua game di bawah satu atap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tawaran Promosi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat Anda mengisi ulang, Anda pasti akan mendapatkan hadiah dan uang ekstra untuk dimainkan dalam hal bonus. Semakin banyak judul game yang Anda ingin mainkan, semakin banyak poin yang terakumulasi yang pada akhirnya mengarah pada lebih banyak hadiah dan peningkatan dalam uang mereka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penawaran lain juga tersedia di mana para pemain dapat mulai bermain tanpa harus menyetor satu sen pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opsi Perbankan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Matt Warman welcomes £1.5M funding boost for Lincolnshire to support domestic abuse victims</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2022/02/17/matt-warman-welcomes-1-5m-funding-boost-for-lincolnshire-to-support-domestic-abuse-victims/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br/>
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

    <title>City Council Leader Responds to “Levelling Up” Announcement</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/02/02/city-council-leader-responds-to-levelling-up-announcement/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&amp;#8217;s long overdue &amp;#8220;Levelling Up&amp;#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&amp;nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carolyn Harris MP stands up for Menopause Warriors in Wales during Welsh Grand Committee debate</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.carolynharris.org.uk/carolyn-harris-mp-stands-up-for-menopause-warriors-in-wales-during-welsh-grand-committee-debate/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Benefits of Distance Education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.lucianaberger.com/benefits-of-distance-education/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.&lt;br /&gt;
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;amp;E.&lt;br /&gt;
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times&lt;br /&gt;
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
