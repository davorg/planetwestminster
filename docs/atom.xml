    <title>Planning for winter</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It is difficult to fathom why the Treasury would want to base a budget on out of date forecasts or on forecasts they expect to be wrong, yet that is what the press allege. They  tell us there is an earlier pre budget cut off date for the forecasts than usual, and that the Treasury accepts the deficit and debt forecasts which have already proved wildly pessimistic this year to date as they did last year. Surely the Treasury should push back hard on the OBR estimates and say they will only treat them seriously if they improve markedly.</p>
<p>It may be that the aim is to follow a tax rise and spending cut policy to slow the economy more to get closer to the poor forecasts. That could work, but why do it when you could have a policy that got you better outcomes on growth and on the deficit.It is clear the tax rises already announced and the Bank of England rate rise threats have slowed the economy badly in recent weeks, alongside the media driven petrol scare and the Lack of wind power.  </p>
<p>It appears that there some gas turbine power stations that have been closed that could be brought back into use quite quickly and  cheaply. The Business Department should  commission them  for stand by and back up power for when renewables fail. </p>
<p>The supply issues over petrol and diesel are resolved. The shortages were caused by panic top ups, not an underlying  shortage of fuel. The HGV driver shortage will take a bit longer to clear, but training and recruitment numbers are rising. The on line delivery networks have shown the right offers  can secure a big  expansion of capacity. </p>
<p>The Budget needs to go for growth. An austerity budget now would be a bad idea. Injecting some good control over spending to secure more value for money is also crucial. The Treasury needs to slim Test and Trace and redirect some of the additional £64 bn awarded to the NHS in the last two years to tackling  waiting lists and non covid treatments.</p>

<p>There are many questions and some quite astonishing proposals following the life sentence given to the evil murderer of Sarah Everard.</p>



<p>The Met Police said any woman who feels threatened should try to flag down a bus.</p>



<p>There were the unbelievable remarks, of the Tory Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, that women need to get a bit more streetwise if they wish to avoid being kidnapped, raped and murdered.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also seen a suggestion that the police only be allowed to arrest in pairs. Not sure how that could work numberswise, at a time when the PM has failed to replace even half the 21,000 officers the Tories cut.</p>



<p>I thought I&#8217;d heard it all but now our Home Secretary Priti Patel, the woman responsible for keeping the streets safe, employing enough police and ensuring we can trust them, has suggested that the answer is a phone tracking system.</p>



<p>All any law-abiding woman will be required to do is report her plans for the evening.</p>



<p>She can then be monitored, in the same way tagged criminals are tracked, and if she fails to reach her destination an alert will be raised.</p>



<p>That wouldn&#8217;t have done much for poor Sarah Everard.</p>



<p>Even worse, this whole system is designed to rely on a triple 8 phone number.</p>



<p>After the fiasco of the NHS App or the experiences of those trying to contact the police on 101, this sounds like yet another dud in the making.</p>



<p>It also has a rather sinister element, it subtlety shifts responsibility to the victim.</p>



<p>She becomes responsible for her safety, rather than the Home Secretary having to answer awkward questions.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure our daughters and granddaughters should be forced into a battery of elaborate precautions before they can enjoy a night out.</p>



<p>I want to know why are there so few police?</p>



<p>Why are our streets so unsafe? And what kind of country have we become where a young woman can be raped and murdered by a police officer who&#8217;s been vetted for the diplomatic protection service and authorised to carry a gun?</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Local MP, Philip Dunne, has called for the safe resumption of services at Bishops Castle Community Hospital as soon as possible, following announcement of a temporary closure.</p>

<p>Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust (Shropcom), which runs Bishops Castle’s hospital, has had longstanding issues attracting qualified nursing staff to run the hospital safely, so has relied on agency staff. The pandemic has exacerbated the situation, and recently shifts have been run with between 75% and 100% of nurses on duty being agency staff, with concerns about patient care.</p>

<p>The Trust has decided to close the hospital to new admissions, and it is anticipated all remaining patients will have been transferred off site or discharged by 31st October.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have discussed this planned closure to new admissions with Shropcom’s new Chief Executive, who has assured me this a temporary measure, pending recruitment of new qualified nursing staff. While it is not clear how long this will take, I have been assured that the decision has been taken on patient safety grounds, and once sufficient staff have been recruited, the hospital will resume normal service.</p>

<p>“The hospital at Bishop’s Castle has been dependent on qualified agency nursing staff, in recent weeks, which is not sustainable. While new staff are being recruited, I am concerned to ensure that existing staff are deployed in the local community or at Ludlow Community Hospital, to give them the stability they need during the interim period. I know the excellent GP medical practice in Bishop’s Castle is working closely with the Community Trust and hospital staff to provide advice and support to local patients.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Adrian Penney, of Bishops Castle Medical Practice, added:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Practice has and will continue to support the Hospital, and recognises the loyalty and commitment of all the staff and is determined to retain them to work locally in the community they know. The Practice would like this to be an opportunity to develop the provision of other medical services locally in the community.”</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>Improving Norfolk’s infrastructure has been one of my central missions since becoming MP for Mid Norfolk just over a decade ago. However, I have always argued that it must not come at the expense of our rural way of life, which is what makes our corner of the world such a wonderful place to live and visit.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Having helped set up the South of the A47 Taskforce two years, I have supported their efforts to lobby Norfolk County Council Highways and National Highways officials for proper mitigation methods and support to alleviate the likely rat-running increases that would be seen during and after the dualling of the A47 between North Tuddenham and Easton, and again once the Norwich Western Link has been constructed. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>That’s why I was delighted to attend a briefing yesterday, alongside Jerome Mayhew MP, Norfolk County Council officials and councillors, to discuss mitigation further – and I was pleased to see that all of the positive progress being made by the local South of the A47 Taskforce was indeed being reflected in the wider Norwich Western Link project. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Jerome Mayhew is supporting communities in his own constituency with similar rat-running concerns and I welcomed confirmation that NCC are doing all they can to look at the issue in the round – determined not to shift the problems to other communities elsewhere, and instead deliver a mitigation package that works best for everyone.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I look forward to continuing my support for the local Taskforce in the months to come.</span></span></span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="http://johnpenrose.org/wp/2021/10/15/weston-mercury-therewithyouthiswinter-weston-mp-to-call-for-lower-energy-price-cap/"><![CDATA[
<p>Weston&#8217;s MP has said that a spike in energy prices could not have come at a worse time following the Covid pandemic&nbsp;and has pledged to push for a more affordable energy price cap to help reduce fuel poverty.</p>



<p>As part of its #ThereWithYouThisWinter campaign, the Mercury recently published figures from the&nbsp;Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) which shows 10 per cent of Weston residents were in fuel poverty pre-pandemic.</p>



<p>Fuel poverty is defined as being when a household is pushed below the poverty line by housing costs and the energy bills needed to have a warm, well-lit home.</p>



<p>John Penrose&nbsp;said: &#8220;Money is tight for everyone after the pandemic, so spiking international gas prices couldn’t have come at a worse time.</p>



<p>&#8220;The good news is that there are more job vacancies than ever before, but some people will still need help, which is why the new&nbsp;£500million Household Support Fund is welcome, on top of the&nbsp;Warm Home Discount Scheme, Cold Weather Payment, and Winter Fuel Payment schemes too.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Household Support Scheme is a fund available to councils across the country to provide small grants for food, clothing and utilities.</p>



<p>Recently, North Somerset Council&#8217;s deputy leader, Cllr Mike Bell, estimated that 13,000 residents across the district would be worse off, and potentially in fuel poverty, due to the end of a £20-a-week Universal Credit uplift on October 6.</p>



<p>There were 5,145 out of&nbsp;51,059 Weston homes (10.1 per cent) in fuel poverty in the year before the Covid pandemic, the DBEIS is yet to release up-to-date figures.</p>



<p>Mr Penrose added that the energy crisis could also be eased through better-insulated homes and further reductions to the Energy Price Cap,&nbsp;the maximum amount that energy suppliers are permitted to charge per kWh of gas and electricity per year.</p>



<p>He said:&nbsp;“The simplest and greenest route to lower heating bills is to use less gas through better-insulated homes, which is where the Green Homes Grant, Home Upgrade Grants and ratcheting up the energy efficiency ratings of rented housing are all helping.</p>



<p>&#8220;But in the short term, the Energy Price Cap is sheltering millions of homes from the worst of the international gas price spike.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am arguing it needs an upgrade so it works even better for customers, and I am pushing ministers and regulators to consider an overhaul as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to speak at Progressive Britain’s conference fringe, ‘Rebuilding Labour and the Nation’. Progressive Britain commissioned a report on how voters view Labour, and how Labour can rebuild trust with the country, and I was invited to reflect and contribute my thoughts on this.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing we’ve learned from recent history, it’s that voters are volatile and that politics can change quickly. It is not enough to simply attack the Tories and hope they fail &#8211; we need to show we have changed.</p>
<p>Labour is most successful when we focus on what matters to voters, rather than us telling them what to care about. We need a positive and optimistic vision for the future, rather than looking to the past, and ensure we appeal to a wide range of voters, not just those who already vote for us.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-234447" src="http://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BEE-NETWORK-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BEE-NETWORK-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BEE-NETWORK-300x157.jpg 300w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BEE-NETWORK-768x401.jpg 768w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BEE-NETWORK-1080x564.jpg 1080w, https://andrewgwynne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BEE-NETWORK.jpg 1455w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is encouraging local residents to get involved with a public conversation on the planned Bee Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bee Network is Transport for Greater Manchester&amp;#8217;s vision for an integrated transport system that will join together buses, trams, cycling and walking by 2024, with rail incorporated by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this public transport system will be accessible, affordable and easy to use, with London-style fare caps and a single multi-modal ticket. Earlier this year, following his re-election as Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham pledged to accelerate the development of the Bee Network, and &lt;a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/news/andy-burnham-vows-to-accelerate-plans-for-improved-london-style-transport-network/"&gt;unveiled more plans&lt;/a&gt; to improve Greater Manchester&amp;#8217;s transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport for Greater Manchester are now inviting local residents to have their say on how the Bee Network should be run and what the priorities should be as the transport system is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents can complete an online survey &lt;a href="https://surveys.tfgm.com/snapwebhost/s.asp?k=163345456163"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which closes on the 12 November. As well as this, the Destination: Bee Network bus tour is touring Greater Manchester throughout October and November, giving residents the opportunity to have an in-person chat to pass on their opinions and insights. The Tour will visit Tameside on the 20th of October at Ashton Interchange, Stand E between 10am-4pm. For Stockport Residents, the Tour will visit on the 23rd of October between 10am-4pm at Stockport Interchange Stand H6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commenting on the Bee Network and the public conversation surrounding it, Andrew Gwynne said: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am thrilled that the Bee Network scheme continues to develop, and that local residents are being invited to give their opinions on the direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bee Network will bring a London-style integrated transport system to Manchester, and provide the environmentally friendly, accessible and affordable transport system that has been long-overdue in Greater Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d encourage all residents across Denton and Reddish to get involved in this public conversation, and have your say on what you want the Bee Network to prioritise.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Places for Everyone Consultation Response</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/places-for-everyone-consultation-response/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"&gt;&lt;div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"&gt;&lt;div class="vc_column-inner"&gt;&lt;div class="wpb_wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="themeum-title " style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;h3 style="font-size:45px;line-height: normal;display:block;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;color:#ed1c24;"&gt;Debbie Abrahams MP&amp;#039;s response to &lt;span style="color:#06396a;"&gt;Places for Everyone Consultation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px" &gt;&lt;span class="vc_empty_space_inner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " &gt;
		&lt;div class="wpb_wrapper"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I submitted my response to the Places for Everyone consultation which you can read in full below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the consultation, &lt;a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning-and-housing/places-for-everyone/"&gt;please find this here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To whom it may concern,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am writing to respond to the consultation on Places for Everyone (PfE). Many constituents have been in touch with me to share their comments on PfE. I welcome recent improvements in PfE however, I share some concerns from constituents which I detail below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth my response will mainly focus on the plans for Oldham Borough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am aware that in August 2014, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) agreed to prepare a joint Development Plan Document, the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF), to set out the approach to housing and employment land across Greater Manchester for the next 20 years. Following the withdrawal of Stockport from the GMSF this has now been superseded by PfE, a long-term plan of nine Greater Manchester districts for jobs, new homes and sustainable growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I support this sub-regional approach. Planning for the jobs of the future needs to be done at a sub-regional level to ensure all of our communities benefit, as well as maximising the use of dwindling public resources. So it is entirely appropriate to consider both the housing and business needs of Oldham borough in the context of Greater Manchester’s. Given recent developments however, it is also important to consider the impact of Covid and how this may change commuting patterns and demand for greater flexibility in the work place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also support the principle of a strong Spatial Framework for Greater Manchester which shows ambition and confidence. The vision ‘To make Greater Manchester one of the best places in the world to grow up, get on and grow old’ is ambitious and bold. We need to see PfE as a key part of developing a new industrial revolution for Greater Manchester, with Oldham and the other local authorities, transformed to a new glory, taking an unprecedented place in our region’s future, where everyone can fulfil their potential and have a home and leisure space that meets their needs at every stage of their lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greater Manchester’s ambition to be the most dementia-friendly region in the country must also be reflected in its approach to neighbourhood and community planning.   &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the 2016 and 2019 draft GMSF documents there has a been a reduction in the number of homes proposed on the majority of greenbelt sites, including across Oldham Borough, with the exception of Broadbent Moss. However, I still share concerns regarding the housing targets being imposed by central Government and the number of greenbelt sites required to meet these.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I regret that the Government has not acceded to the three points I made in response to their national planning policy demands on the draft GMSF:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That the Government should develop more realistic population estimates and amend the housing needs identified in Oldham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That the Government should adopt a ‘Brownfield First’ development strategy, so reducing demand on greenbelt land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That the Government should provide remediation funding to enable Brownfield sites to be decontaminated, as necessary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had hoped that the petition I set up on this would have put the Government under more pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PfE sets out that brownfield land will predominantly be the source of new housing development which is welcome news. However, I recognise that, disappointingly, PfE has also been hampered by national planning policy and as such has not been able to demand that all the brownfield sites are developed first. I believe this is a major error by the Government and the Lib-Dem/Conservative Coalition before it. 7,712 homes are allocated for building on brownfield land compared to 1,276 homes on greenfield land and 2,176 homes on allocations proposed in the Green Belt. Over 136,720 sqm on allocations for industry and warehousing are proposed in the Green Belt compared with 66,269 sqm on brownfield land and 65,252 sqm on mixed sites (brownfield and greenfield land).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m pleased that Oldham Council has adopted a Brownfield First policy and has included an extra 2,000 homes in the town centre and a Mills Strategy providing a further 800 homes but I recognise the constraints of the national planning policy that they are working within.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am also concerned that the target for the number of homes that we need to build locally as set by the Government, across the plan period the total housing required in Oldham is 10,884 homes, doesn’t reflect our population estimates for the next 20 years, making it more difficult to just build on available brownfield land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my discussions with constituents about the draft GMSF, they raised concerns about green belt development both in person and in writing with several local groups coming together to oppose the plans. Since then building on greenbelt land has reduced. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PfE provides a more balanced mix of homes including a minimum target of providing 50,000 affordable homes up to 2037. In Oldham, we have just under 6,000 households on the housing waiting list which show there is clearly an urgent demand for more housing in the borough. I also understand that there will be an intention to develop an approach to defining what ‘affordable housing’ actually means for Greater Manchester. We need to be cautious about new definitions which may prevent comparisons with other parts of the country and over time. I believe any new definitions should be in addition to current definitions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will continue to make the case for affordable homes, and in particular, the need for more social rented homes so we can really start to tackle our housing crisis. I was struck by previous research by First Choice Homes Oldham which showed nearly 1 in 6 Oldhamers can’t afford a social rent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the last 7 years or so, I have stressed the importance of better joined up thinking between different parts of the public sector, for example, planning and transport, planning and education, planning and health. This is the key concern that the hundreds of residents that I have spoken to mentioned about the GMSF and now PfE. In particular the impact on the existing infrastructure, including roads, schools and health facilities is a huge concern. The detailed policies for site allocations set out the details for infrastructure requirements and state that sites will not come forward unless it can be demonstrated this will be provided. However, there is some work to do to ensure residents concern are listened to and that they are aware of plans to ensure infrastructure can cope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The suitability of some of the sites identified for development was also raised. For example, Beal Valley and Broadbent Moss were both described by residents as areas liable to flood and with concerns around local wildlife and habitat corridors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local proposals and concerns raised with me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locally PfE plans in my Oldham East &amp;amp; Saddleworth constituency include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Cowlishaw remains with 460 homes proposed as in the 2019 revised draft GMSF. Beal Valley is earmarked for 480 homes as in the 2019 revised draft GMSF. Both were down on the numbers proposed in the original 2016 draft GMSF. I note both allocations include retaining and enhancing the hierarchy of biodiversity within the site, as well as the need for appropriate infrastructure requirements. However, I am still concerned about the juxtaposition of the Beal Valley and Broadbent Moss with the Cowlishaw development; the infrastructure implications must be well considered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8211; The allocation that was Kingsway South, a cross boundary proposal between Rochdale and Oldham, in the 2019 draft GMSF has now been removed. PfE now identifies High Crompton Broad Location. This is noted as a key high growth corridor area in PfE. However no boundary is identified and the site remains in the Green Belt until such time that a review of PfE / Oldham’s Local Plan can demonstrate that it’s release is fully justified. Any development would need to ensure that necessary infrastructure is delivered to accommodate the likely scale of development. I welcome this news.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PfE does see some improvements in the Shaw, Crompton and Royton area (with the current removal of Kingsway South) which previously included large allocations within a short radius. However Shaw, Crompton and Royton still sees some valued recreational green spaces diminish. Many residents are also still concerned about how roads, air pollution levels, schools and health services (particularly GP services) will cope with the additional homes proposed in the area. There are also proposals for 400 additional homes on the old Shop Direct Mill site off Linney Lane, Shaw. This needs to be considered in the context of plans under PfE. It is important that local residents are engaged throughout and communicated with on recent changes to plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-A new tram stop has been proposed for Cop Road to serve the new housing development for Broadbent Moss and Beal Valley as well as bus transit between Rochdale and Oldham. I have noted that developers would be required to be partially fund transport improvements and development would not go ahead without appropriate infrastructure plans in place.  However some residents have raised concerns whether this provision would be adequate given the number of homes proposed across this area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Broadbent Moss, near Sholver will see over 1450 homes as well as new employment space. Residents have raised concerns about the use of greenbelt to build homes and the impact on the existing road and other local infrastructure and major pinch points such as Ripponden Road. I understand a new internal spine road will be developed but constituents have still raised concerns on the impact on arterial roads. There are also concerns around flood risks and the impact on local wildlife and habitat corridors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-I welcome the removal of 50 new homes that were proposed at Spinners Way to the north east of Moorside. Residents previously raised concerns about a change in natural water course and flooding as the land was on a steep slope, lack of available local school places and impact on existing road infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Plans at Chew Brook Vale (Fletchers Mill) also see revised proposals with Chew Brook Vale reduced allocation of homes from 171 to 90. The site area has been reduced to minimise Green Belt release and now only relates to the brownfield mill site. In addition, one site is proposed to be added to the Green Belt in Oldham &amp;#8211; Land behind Denshaw Village Hall – 0.6 hectares. This is welcome news.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For many residents the process to reach PfE has been an arduous one and for some there are still a number of concerns. There will never be a strategy that pleases everyone. However, I recognise we do need to put a plan in place for our housing and employment needs otherwise, as the Government have already threatened, if they deem that the local land supply identified is insufficient, we risk it being taken out of our hands locally and the power transferred to developers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PfE does see more development on brownfield land and a reduction in Greenbelt land for development. This must be welcomed and I applaud Oldham Council on their Brownfield First approach, their Mills Strategy and Town Centre plans all of which have helped reduce the greenbelt take by over 1,800 (across Oldham borough) since the last iteration of the GMSF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through the Plan’s liftime we need to ensure joined up thinking between different parts of the public sector, for example, planning and transport, planning and education, planning and health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the heart of a future PfE must be the people we serve – these new proposals should fully and meaningfully engage with local people, including all elected representatives. It is important that this process is open and transparent with views sought from residents and stakeholders at all stages and the outcomes from these shared widely. This should go beyond the normal consultation process and include options such as local ballots (used in some parts of London) where residents can have a say in the design of their local area should be considered on a longer-term basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently, there is a loophole in national policy which allows developers to submit viability assessments with their planning applications, showing that the amount of affordable housing required in a local plan would reduce their profit margin. This can be used to argue that they should be allowed to reduce the amount of affordable housing they build. This is unacceptable and I will continue to oppose it. We need to have stringent processes in place to reduce the risk of this happening locally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debbie Abrahams MP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dear Newcastle October 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/10/dear-newcastle-october-2021/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Parliament returned to a series of critical debates on very important subjects. The Elections Bill is an attempt by the Conservative Government to make it harder for people to vote, just as we should be making it easier!  They Tories also rushed through a vote on the funding of the Prime Minister’s so called Social Care Plan, even though there was no detail on who would be funded to do what, and the rise in National Insurance Contributions would hit some of the poorest hardest. And Labour forced a vote on the Tories   huge cut to Universal Credit payments – the Tories did not have the courage of their supposed convictions to vote against it, but are still refusing to scrap the cut. At the same time, many constituents continue to contact me on behalf of relatives under threat in Afghanistan. The Foreign Office has been forced to apologise for not responding to MP enquiries. This is a desperate time for many UK citizens with connections to Afghanistan and Government is once more showing it is unable to meet basic levels of competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proud to join the Fusiliers on the day they were granted the Freedom of the City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then of course the country was hit by a series of supply chain crisis which has left some supermarket shelves bare and had drivers queuing for hours to get petrol as well as an energy crisis which has seen energy companies (including in Newcastle) go bust and consumers facing huge energy price hikes.   These crises are entirely made in Whitehall, a combination of incompetence, lack of preparation, arrogance and being out of touch. The petrol shortage is a particularly frustrating example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a shortage of HGV drivers for years but the Government refused to take action to address it, preferring to leave it to the market. Brexit meant that many foreign drivers left, Covid and the stress of complex tariff rules meant that more left, and yet Government did not see that coming. I shared the example of a constituent who sought help to train as a HGV driver six years ago, with the Minister promising the market would sort it (&lt;a href="https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/09/hgv-driver-shortages-since-2015/"&gt;https://chionwurahmp.com/2021/09/hgv-driver-shortages-since-2015/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is the cost of living pressures which will be the most devastating for constituents, energy price rises, food price rises, a cut to universal credit of £20 per week. This will cause real hardship in the constituency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small business visit  Brew &amp;amp; Bite on Ashburton Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that context the Labour party Conference in Brighton was an opportunity to show that we were concentrating on the issues that matter to people facing huge challenges. Whilst the media reporting tried to exaggerate divisions in the party, overall there were many positive reports particularly on our announcements  on mental health and education. I spoke at thirteen events, including two dinners, and there was an overwhelmingly positive atmosphere and reception from attendees for the engagement around my briefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backbench and Constituency Role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been a real pleasure to return to in person visits. I was particular moved by my meeting with victims of domestic violence who have found refuge in Newcastle. I also met with businesses and community groups across the constituency, and spoke at the re-opening of the reinvigorated Lit and Phil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have made progress on a partial return to the office. Thanks to Carol Stanners for her Covid secure rota we will have a presence in the Newcastle office each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Newcastle based green energy company, Green, unfortunately went bankrupt as a consequence of the Government’s incompetence. The Business Secretary called them a ‘failing’ company. I highlighted his many failings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was proud to march with the 5th Fusiliers through the streets of Newcastle as they were granted the Freedom of the City by Newcastle City Council.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were successful in recruiting  a new Parliamentary Assistant. Maddy Eagan has already started work. She is North Shields woman with strong local background and great experience including working for Andy Burnham.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maria has agreed to rejoin the team on a temporary basis to support Carol on administrative duties whilst we seek a longer time solution to the changes in apprentice training which means we cannot take an admin apprentice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding issues and demands for support for constituents and businesses, on support for businesses exporting to the the EU, on the problem of pigeons damaging the war memorial in Eldon Square.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I will be following up with Ministers on correspondence regarding a meeting with Wylam brewery, which we have still yet to get a commitment on.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keir’s Leader’s speech had significant digital and technology content:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A focus on the long-term will allow for better investments. Labour will make Britain a world leader in science and research and development. We will set a target to invest a minimum of 3 percent of GDP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A scientific revolution is happening around us but if we don’t have a government ready to remake the nation the opportunity will pass us by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I sought to limit my appearances this year and was only there for two days, Conference required a huge amount of preparation for 13 appearances  talking about elements of my brief. I think overall it was a great success with much positive feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kanishka also left us sadly and we are looking for additional support on the digital front as the Online Safety Bill continues through pre-legislative scrutiny with the formation of a committee of both houses to look at it. We worked to produce a briefing on the Bill and our key aims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I met with a number of stakeholders on the continuing issues of algorithmic surveillance of workers and algorithmic bias.&lt;/li&gt;

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Jon Cruddas MP for Dagenham and Rainham is one of 118 MPs and peers that has <a href="https://sfcawebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/document/Letter-Final.pdf">written</a> to the recently-appointed Secretary of State for Education Nadhim Zahawi urging him to make an “early reassessment” of the Department for Education’s plan to remove funding for the vast majority of applied general qualifications such as BTECs.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The letter was sent to support the #ProtectStudentChoice <a href="https://www.protectstudentchoice.org/">campaign</a>, a coalition of 21 organisations that represent and support students and staff in schools, colleges and universities. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In July, the Department confirmed plans to introduce a twin-track system of A levels and T levels (a new suite of technical qualifications), where most young people pursue one of these qualifications at the age of 16. As a result, funding for most BTEC qualifications will be removed. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In their letter to the Education Secretary, the MPs and peers say this new system <em>“will leave many students without a viable pathway after their GCSEs, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds”</em> and report concerns from the education sector that <em>“removing the vast majority of BTECs will lead to students taking courses that do not meet their needs, or dropping out of education altogether”.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The parliamentarians welcome the introduction of T levels but say that <em>“it is not necessary to remove applied general qualifications to make T levels a success”</em> and that it is <em>“perfectly possible for both to co-exist with A levels in the future qualifications landscape”</em>.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Under current proposals, larger BTEC qualifications (equivalent in size to 2 or 3 A levels) will be scrapped if the government deems they <em>“overlap”</em> with A levels or T levels. But the MPs and peers call for the option to study BTECs to be retained as they <em>“are a different type of qualification that provide a different type of educational experience - one that combines the development of skills with academic learning”.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The letter concludes by urging the Secretary of State to <em>“recalibrate”</em> plans to move to a two-route model of A levels and T levels and asks for an assurance that <em>“students will continue to have the choice to study a wide range of applied general qualifications in the future”.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas said:</strong> <em>“If the government goes ahead with their plans to scrap BTEC qualifications it will be a step backwards for social mobility and will do little to address the growing skills shortage in the United Kingdom. I am in complete support of the campaign to protect student choice and am urging the Secretary of State for Education to reassess the decision to scrap BTECs.”</em></p>

<p>Figures from the House of Commons Library show that the number of GPs in Cumbria and North Lancashire has plummeted from 404 in September 2015 to 331 in June 2021.</p>
<p>It comes as many people are struggling to book an appointment with their GP, with services increasingly under pressure from rising demand.</p>
<p>Further analysis by the British Medical Association (BMA) shows a dismal picture overall for GPs, with there being the equivalent of over 1,900 fewer fully qualified, full-time GPs now than there were in 2015.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"The worsening GP shortage has given rise to a postcode lottery, with our hard-working doctors overstretched and people left waiting too long for treatment or even an appointment.</em></p>
<p><em>"Having worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic and to roll out the life-saving vaccines, GPs now find themselves being subjected to shameful abuse with no support from ministers.</em></p>
<p><em>"Rather than slagging off our hard-working GPs in the press, the Government should be investing in training up more doctors, to ensure patients get the fair deal they deserve."</em></p>

    <title>A government in chaos, a country in crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://judithcummins.org.uk/a-government-in-chaos-a-country-in-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Judith&amp;#8217;s latest op-ed for the Telegraph &amp;amp; Argus Weds 13 October 2021:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With winter almost upon us, we see the Government of our country in chaos and our country teetering on the brink of crisis with queues at the forecourts; empty shelves and energy prices skyrocketing. A basic principle of government is to insulate the country from external shocks, but a lack of planning, a Prime Minister seemingly absent from duty and soaking up the Marbella sun and cabinet ministers squabbling is in fact risking turning crises into disasters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past week we’ve seen denials from the Treasury that the claims of the Secretary of State for Business, Kwasi Kwarteng MP, that he is speaking to the Chancellor about urgent support for firms struggling with fast-rising energy prices are untrue – who are we meant to believe? But more importantly, the question I ask is why the Chancellor and the Business Secretary are not talking to each other to avert a fast-approaching crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crisis where millions of families are set to be squeezed by a triple whammy of rising energy prices, an increase in national insurance, and the cut to Universal Credit. This will be felt by families not only in my Bradford South constituency and the wider Bradford District, but right across the country. Recent statistics show that the decisions of the Government will leave the average working family over £1700 worse off by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Government must change course and protect working families whilst they still have the chance. By cancelling&amp;nbsp;the Universal Credit cut, dropping the tax rises on working people and businesses, and urgently exploring further measures to help households alleviate the cost of rising bills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning now to Northern Powerhouse Rail, reports are rife that the government is expected to block the inclusion of Bradford on the route in a bid to save money. Whilst for the current government spending money on Transport infrastructure in the South East is seen as an investment it appears that once again, spending money in the North is non-existent. This is just not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s time for the Prime Minister to put his money where his mouth is and deliver action on his levelling-up agenda, starting with a Bradford stop on the Northern Powerhouse rail route.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as delivering on improved infrastructure and opportunity for the North, the Prime Minister and his Government must work to urgently address backlogs in the DVLA. This coupled with the HGV driver shortage has left motorists struggling to fill up their cars and shops unable to fill the shelves to their usual capacity. Over the past few months, I’ve had many Bradford South constituents contact me to say that their license renewal has been pending for weeks; they are unable to contact the DVLA to progress or check the status of their application and some have even approached me to say that their employment is at risk because of DVLA delays. This cannot continue. We need the DVLA backlog to be resolved sooner rather than later. The government needs to get a grip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as issues with the DVLA, my mailbox has recently seen an increase in constituents contacting me who are struggling to get a face-to-face appointment with their GP. Whilst I and many others appreciate that for some people digital and remote consultations with their GP will be welcomed, it is imperative that face to face appointments continue to be commonplace and that all GP Practices are open and operational. Access to GP services is vital and I know that our GPs are trying their best in difficult circumstances, but they need better support from the Government to be able to triage and treat patients in way that works for all. That is why I have previously and will continue to raise access to GPs both locally with the Bradford District and Craven CCG and nationally with the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care to try and secure a better deal for both GPs and patients alike.  On a final note, next week parliament will return from the conference recess and there will be an important adjournment debate on Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) within Bradford. I’m clear that we need to reflect and learn lessons from the past and ensure that such acts cannot happen again. But I also feel just as strongly that we need to ensure that this debate looks at the ways in which agencies and individuals can all work together to make Bradford not only safer but the safest place in the country for children to grow up in. We’ve seen first-hand in our city what can happen when we don’t get this right, we cannot afford to let that happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preet backs calls for Government to reverse the decision cutting funding to landmine clearance charities </title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://preetkaurgill.com/content/preet-backs-calls-government-reverse-decision-cutting-funding-landmine-clearance-charities" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
          <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today Preet Kaur Gill MP has called on Government to reverse its decision to cut funding by 75% for the removal of land mines and unexploded bombs.  </p>
<p>The Government recently announced that funding which would see deadly explosive devices cleared, has been reduced from £100 million to just £25 million over three years. </p>
<p>People in South Sudan, Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Iraq, Lebanon and Vietnam will no longer receive any UK support for their efforts to rid communities of the peril of landmines and other remnants of war. This follows the efforts of many overseas activists and volunteers who supported UK’s efforts to demine the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands, over the last two years. </p>
<p>Landmines and unexploded bombs affect 60 million people in the world today, with 15 people killed or injured every day. UK aid for mine clearance means children can go back to school safely, communities can grow crops on their land, and families can return to their homes. </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “Not only will this risk lives and have a devastating impact to millions of people around the world, but it will do further damage to the UK’s global reputation. We have stood shoulder to shoulder with our friends and allies across the world to ensure that British territories are declared mine free. Now, when the time has come to repay the favour, this Government has made the cowardly decision to back away.” </p>
<p>This catastrophic decision has been met with outrage by those on both sides of the political aisle as well as charities throughout the sector. </p>
<p>The British charity the Halo Trust, which was very publicly supported by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, as she walked through a minefield in Angola, said the decision was “staggering” and would lead to a huge decline of its operations in countries such as Zimbabwe and Myanmar. </p>
<p>Retired Major General James Cowan, former commander of British troops in Afghanistan and now Halo’s CEO, said the reduction in the funding had come as a “huge shock”. </p>
<p>“This is going to be devastating to our work around the world. We are operating now without any British money in Afghanistan and yet we are a British charity. It is a great British success story and yet it is not being funded by the British.” </p>
<p>Darren Cormack, CEO of the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), said the funding reduction represented a “catastrophic collapse in support that will harm the lives of vulnerable people across the world and do immeasurable harm to Britain’s global standing”. </p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>A new Community Diagnostic Centre will be built in Welwyn Hatfield, one of 40 across the country – providing a one-stop-shop for key testing to boost early diagnoses, and speed up and increase referrals.</strong></p>
<p>The Centres will provide a full range of scans and tests to patients to catch illnesses at the earliest signs – increasing NHS capacity and saving lives as we tackle the historic elective backlog caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>This builds on the £5.4 billion announced in September 2021 to tackle the backlog over the next six months.</p>
<p>Local MP Grant Shapps has welcomed the announcement that the QEII centre in Welwyn Garden City has been selected as one of 40 sites across England for a new Community Diagnostic Centre to be built.</p>
<p>The new centre will begin providing services over the next six months, with all 40 centres set to be fully operational by March 2022.</p>
<p>The centre will provide services closer to home for people in Welwyn Hatfield to meet rising demand, as part of the Conservative Government’s plan to tackle the NHS backlog and catch health issues quickly.</p>
<p>The QEII’s new Community Diagnostic Centre will achieve earlier diagnoses for patients through easier, faster, and more direct access to the full range of scans and tests needed to understand patients’ symptoms – including breathlessness and cancer symptoms.</p>
<p>The centre will also help reduce the risk of Covid transmission, and contributed to the NHS’ net zero efforts by reducing the number of patients journeys required in Welwyn Hatfield through providing multiple scans and tests in a single visit.</p>
<p>The pandemic has meant that many people with health concerns have refrained from coming forward for checks and scans, while non-urgent procedures were postponed to allow the NHS to focus on the Covid response. Boosting diagnostic services is key to supporting the NHS in clearing the backlog.</p>
<p>The Government announced on 6 September 2021 an extra £5.4 billion to support the NHS as it responds to Covid over the next six months. This additional funding is on top of the £36 billion already committed to health and social care over the next three years through the Health and Care Levy.</p>
<p>The funding raised through the Levy includes £8 billion to tackle backlogs and help the NHS increase capacity on pre-pandemic levels by providing an extra 9 million checks, scans, and operations for patients across the country.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mr Shapps said: “We know that many people have not been coming forward for key tests throughout the pandemic, which has contributed to the backlog, and can result in worsening health outcomes.</p>
<p>“The new Community Diagnostic Centre will help deliver better services for people across Welwyn Hatfield. By allowing problems to be detected earlier, better treatment can be given to patients.</p>
<p>“Through investing in early diagnosis and increasing NHS capacity we will be able to treat serious illnesses sooner and save lives – levelling up health outcomes across the country.”</p>
<p>Commenting, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “Due to Covid, we have a historic backlog – there were 300,000 fewer urgent cancer referrals over the pandemic than were expected, and the backlog could grow to as high as 13 million in the coming years unless addressed.</p>
<p>“We are announcing 40 new Community Diagnostic Centres which will help us tackle the backlog by bringing vital services closer to home, allowing us to meet rising demand, catch cancer and other issues as quickly as possible, and save more lives.</p>
<p>“The Conservatives are the party of the NHS. We protected the NHS from being overwhelmed during the most challenging period in its history. Now, as we help the NHS build back better from the pandemic, we must do the same. Today’s announcement is a big step towards achieving this aim”.</p></div>

    <title>ARTICLE: Westminster Brexit Damage Continues</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.drewhendrymp.scot/westminster-damage/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=westminster-damage" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Panic fuel buying, empty shop shelves, unharvested crops, a collapse in exports and chronic labour shortages are all, in part, or in the case of exports, fully, down to Brexit.</p>
<p>Take the disastrous decision to leave the biggest single market globally and end freedom of movement, add in the toxic tory mix of cuts to Universal Credit, increased energy costs and rising inflation and it’s easy to see why people are predicting a winter of discontent, with Brexit turbocharging the gloom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tory politicians are out in force every day –  in print, on our screens and radios – trying to deny the impact of Brexit. To be fair, it is what we expect from the Tories – trying to defend the indefensible is their staple, but where is the Official Opposition? The Labour party is on record saying they won’t look at reversing the damage of Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer was urging people in Scotland to vote Labour – despite the party offering to inflict more of the same tory harm. Sorry Sir Keir, nobody is buying it.</p>
<p>Just for starters, we urgently need a realisation from the UK Government and Labour at Westminster that the UK immigration system does not meet the needs of Scotland. The humiliating and pathetic Westminster U-turn to allow 5,000 HGV drivers and 5,500 poultry temporary working visas, isn’t going to even plaster over it.</p>
<p>The British Chambers of Commerce termed the action as “throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire”, and they are right. Why on Earth will 10,000 continental Europeans come to work in the UK for only three months when they can find better-paid jobs closer to home? Those who do respond to the “help us save the UK’s Christmas” plea will then be promptly kicked out on the 24<sup>th</sup> of December. You won’t find a more tasteless joke in the cheapest crackers.</p>
<p>Although I don’t hold much hope, maybe this desperate U-turn is a sign of the penny dropping in Westminster. If that’s the case, the UK Government needs to genuinely engage with the EU to seek solutions to their self-imposed crisis.</p>
<p>It beggars belief that any government would continue to inflict this level of self-harm on its economy. Before Brexit, they called it scaremongering; now, we are told there is no crisis. They desperately hope you will look away long enough not to see the catastrophe unfolding but is hard to imagine anyone out there who isn’t seeing what a Tory Brexit looks like in all its horrific glory.</p>

    <title>Additional vessel is a step in the right direction, says Isles MP</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;The addition of the vessel, MV Utne, to the Calmac fleet is a step in the right direction, says Isles MP Angus MacNeil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png"&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id="3347" data-permalink="https://angusmacneilsnp.com/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png" data-orig-size="3096,4128" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=225" data-large-file="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=529" src="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=768" alt="" class="wp-image-3347" srcset="https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=768 768w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=1536 1536w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=113 113w, https://hebridesmpandmsp.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/image.png?w=225 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;#8220;This is a welcome step in the right direction.&amp;#8221;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil welcomed the news that a deal has been reached to purchase a ferry for deployment on the Clyde and Hebrides network – a move that should relieve some of the current pressures on the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deployment details will be confirmed by CalMac in due course, subject to the vessel achieving MCA certification and the completion of crew training and sea trials.&amp;nbsp; Engagement work is now underway with key stakeholders to develop detailed deployment, cascade and related timetables for the 2022 summer season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr MacNeil said: “This is a welcome step in the right direction. The islands are popular and demand will keep growing but we also need a booking management system that gives different time-length opportunities for booking.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MV Utne has been earmarked for the Oban-Craignure route, and communities in Skye and the Western Isles will also benefit as a result of the cascade of vessels elsewhere on the network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Weekly Round-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.christinarees.org/my-weekly-round-up-63/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the House of Commons Chamber <u>on Monday evening</u> the UK Government proposed an “Instruction Motion” to amend the Elections Bill which is at its Committee Stage of the House of Commons. The amendment would broaden the scope of the Elections Bill to include provision for a simple majority voting system for the following elections: the Mayor of London; an elected Mayor in England Local Authorities; a Mayor in a Combined Authority; and Police and Crime Commissioners. The Minister who was taking this Bill through the House has been promoted in the PM’s recent reshuffle, so the Minister of State for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Local Communities Christopher Pincher moved the motion and set out the reasons for amending the scope of the Bill. He said that the Conservative Manifesto had committed to first past the post and was the majority view (67%) of the British people in the 2011 Referendum. The Labour Spokesperson Cat Smith MP, Leicester and Fleetwood, stated that the Bill had already started, Second Reading has debated the merits or otherwise of the contents of the Bill, and the Committee has already finished taking evidence. As a member of the Panel of Chairs I chaired the evidence sessions, and Cat Smith raised a Point of Order at the final evidence session last week when she saw the Instruction Motion had been added to this week’s Order Paper. Cat asked me whether we could take evidence on electoral systems at that session and I was clear that it was out of the scope of the existing Bill. But should the Instruction be accepted and the scope of the Bill widened, then extra evidence sessions would not be a matter for the Chair, because matters such as this are decided through the usual channels (Government and Opposition Whips). Cat also asked Mr Pincher during the debate why the UK Government had not put this in the Bill from the start, allowing members to scrutinise it on Second Reading and in Committee. Cat also stated that it was in the UK Government’s Conservative 2017 Manifesto but not in the 2019 version, and that the Bill started under the Cabinet Office, but it has been moved to the newly renamed “Department for Levelling Up”. Cat said that the motion stinks of gerrymandering and Labour will be voting against it. The UK Government won the division by 309 to 186 votes. As a chair of the Bill, I am not permitted to vote on the Bill, but I would certainly have voted against the U.K. Government Instruction for the reasons set out by Cat.</p>
<p>Later that evening I attended a celebration in the House of Lords for the GB athletes who had taken part in the Olympics and Paralympics. Parliamentarians had the opportunity to meet the athletes and congratulate them on their wonderful performances at the Tokyo Olympic Games. I met my old friend Tanni Grey-Thompson who was speaking at the event and we had a chance to catch up on various aspects of UK sport, because we haven’t seen one another since pre-pandemic times. Tanni and I share a passion for sport. My dear friend Sue’s grandson Owain Lloyd-Hughes aged 19, was there. Owain is a 100/200 metres runner and a member of Neath Harriers Amateur Athletic Club, and is aiming to be part of the Commonwealth Games Relay Team, but has been suffering with an injury. We wish him a speedy recovery in time for the indoor athletic season.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I chaired the first joint meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Sport and the APPG for the Olympics and Paralympics, of which I am a Vice-Chair. The title of the meeting was “Beyond Tokyo – Securing a Sustainable Future for Local Sport and Leisure Facilities”, hosted by the Sport and Recreation Alliance, the secretariat for the APPG Sport, with guest speakers: Lord Colin Moynihan, Co-chair of APPG Olympics and Paralympics, Vice-chair of APPG Sport, Chair of the British Olympic Association 2005-12, and former rowing Olympic silver medalist at Moscow 1980; Cllr Gerald Vernon-Jackson Liberal Democrat Leader of Portsmouth Council, Chair of Local Government Association Culture, Tourism and Sport Board; and Huw Edwards, Chief Executive Officer Ukactive since 2019, Leisure Sector Champion 2017, and worked for the Olympic Delivery Authority for the London Olympics. Over 35 sport sector agencies joined in the Zoom event and had the opportunity to question the speakers. The speakers found common ground on the need to have increased funding, updated leisure facilities because most Local Authority centres were built in the 1970’s, and that the health and well-being of participating in sport and leisure activities is known to prevent physical and mental illness. Also that the lack of statutory provision for leisure at local government level means that in these times of UK Government cuts, the delivery of social services and looked-after children services would always be ahead of leisure in local government. And that women, people on low income, and ethnic minorities are reluctant to take part in leisure, which is a challenge to everyone involved in delivering leisure facilities at whatever level. But grassroots sport is so important in that it encourages participation and forms the base of the pyramid for international participation. Lord Moynihan was concerned at the lack of joined up thinking across UK Government departments because leisure straddles sport, health, education, local government and there should be a common strategy, and the Lords often succeed in implementing change because they work on a cross-party basis, whereas in the Commons, the UK Government has such a large majority that it is able to implement its legislation without amendments. The opposition can provide scrutiny but is unable to prevent U.K. Government proposals becoming legislation.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday the UK Government granted Labour an Opposition Day debate, and we laid a motion entitled “Finances of Working People: Government Policy”. Labour Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson MP, Houghton and Sunderland South, spoke about the growing squeeze on living standards caused by the £1040 per year reduction to Universal Credit, the rise in National Insurance Contributions for low and middle income workers, the freezing of the personal income tax allowance from April 2022, the increasing cost of household energy bills, the highest petrol prices since 2013 with the potential for the highest rail fare increase in a decade, the fastest rise in private rental costs since 2008, successive above inflation increases in childcare costs, and rising prices resulting from the supply chain disruptions caused by worker and supply shortages, and she called on the UK Government to change its direction on its policies, because they have created an avoidable and unacceptable burden on working people. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mims Davies MP, Eastleigh, responded by stating that during the pandemic the UK Government stepped in to pay the wages of millions of workers, investing over £400 billion in jobs packages, protecting jobs and safeguarding livelihoods, including kickstart, restart, doubling work coaches, job entry support, job finding support, sector-based work academy programmes, an enhanced youth offer, expansion of the job centre network, assisting claimants with benefits, and harnessing skills in a new way. She said that measures were temporary and now public health restrictions have been relaxed, this support must end. Her message to everyone in the chamber and beyond was “if you want to progress in the jobs market, whoever you are, wherever you are – at any age or any stage – we are here for you. We will get behind you.” I’m sorry, but I don’t think the UK Government live in the real world. Unfortunately we lost the vote on our motion by 222 to 300 votes.</p>
<p><u>On Wednesday morning</u> as Vice-Chair of the APPG for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) I joined an officers meeting convened by the chair, Chris Bryant MP, Rhondda, to discuss his Private Members’ Bill (PMB) on Acquired Brain Injury scheduled for <u>Friday 3rd December</u>. Chris has been campaigning to raise awareness of ABI for many years, and has cross Party support for this very important condition. However, as with nearly every opposition PMB, it will require UK Government support to make it to the next stage. Our APPG has written many letters to UK Government Ministers and the Prime Minister seeking support, but to date, we have only received warm words. But we shall keep fighting for justice for ABI sufferers.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson was in the US, so this week’s Prime Minister’s Questions was between the Deputy PM, Dominic Raab, and our own Deputy Leader Angela Rayner, who began by raising the lack of progress being made by the PM n Washington before testing the Deputy PM’s fuse by asking him whether he still thinks that British workers are “the worst idlers in the world”. Angela asked how many days a minimum-wage worker would have to work to afford one night in a luxury hotel in Crete, somewhere not unfamiliar to Mr Raab. The answer is 50 days, but this is without the financial burdens already imposed on working families due to the UK Government policies of £1040 cut to Universal Credit, rising rent costs, soaring food prices, tax increases and the impending energy crisis. Families are faced with choosing to put food on the table, or heat their homes. Angela asked the UK Tory Government to cancel its cut to Universal Credit. I bobbed from the back benches throughout PMQs in the hope that Mr Speaker would call me to ask a question, but alas it didn’t happen.</p>
<p><u>On Friday morning</u> I joined the regular update Zoom call with SBUHB for Swansea Region MPs/MSs to listen to the <a href="https://sbuhb.nhs.wales/coronavirus-covid-19/information/vaccine-in-swansea-and-npt/vaccination-newsletters/">latest report</a> of the pandemic situation in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot. I can not imagine the extreme pressure that NHS and social care staff must be under. NPT has the highest rates of coronavirus in the UK. The rates of infection are increasing, hospital admissions are increasing, there are very high rates in schools, pupils are taking it home and it is spreading throughout the community. The vaccination programme has been successful and it is this that has prevented the rates being much higher. But people who have been double jabbed are still at risk of being infected because the Delta variant is so infectious, so other mitigating actions, such as social distancing and mask wearing indoors, regular hand washing, sanitising, must be maintained. SBUHB are rolling out the booster vaccination programme and flu jabs, plus vaccinations for 12-15 year olds have started. I thank all the NHS staff and volunteers from the bottom of my heart for working tirelessly to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Later that morning I hosted a McMillan Coffee Morning in Dove Workshop, Banwen, and I want to thank Lesley, Julie and Ellie for all their support organising it, and for Lesley’s wonderful homemade cheese scones! The event was well-attended and I’m pleased to say we raised a fantastic £86 for the Macmillan charity. It was fantastic to be out and about once more in the community and to be chatting with people face to face. Macmillan Coffee Mornings are such a wonderful idea – not only do they raise awareness of the realities of cancer and raise money for the cancer nurses whose work is so vital, but they also allow people the chance to really talk about cancer and any concerns they themselves may have – memories of family and friends who have been ill with cancer and the impact that cancer has on a wide network of people. Thank you so much to everyone who came, to Dove Workshop for hosting us, and to Macmillan for the sterling work that they do day in, day out.</p>
<p>I also met lots of residents at the McMillan Coffee Morning organised by Sacha, Hannah, and Maerdy Youth, hosted by Cllr Sonia Reynolds which took place in Canolfan Maerdy, Tairgwaith, which was also visited by former MS Gwenda Thomas and Cllr Arwyn Woolcock.</p>
<p>As part of the Great Big Green Week celebrations I dropped in to the Friends and Neighbours Community Alliance (FAN) event. FAN was started by Emma Knight when she moved to live in Ethel Street in 2008, and organised a fancy dress Halloween Street Party. Over 50 people turned up and enjoyed themselves so much that FAN was formed by volunteers for the benefit of the community. There is also a junior arm called Mini FANS. Events such as fitness for the elderly, drumming workshops, circus groups, street cleans, and raffles have taken place. FAN has created a community garden growing herbs, vegetables and fruit, with a greenhouse made from plastic bottles. FAN has also organised WWF Earth Hour, Fair-trade events, and is committed to going green, zero carbon, and other climate change measures, for our next generation.</p>
<p>I know that there are many constituents who are concerned about the threat of a rise in energy prices. A basic duty of government is to ensure secure and affordable energy supplies for households and businesses. But millions of families are now set to be squeezed by a triple whammy of rising energy prices, an increase in national insurance, and the cut to Universal Credit. This UK Tory Government has no idea what it is like for working people outside of their bubble where they’ve never had to worry about paying the rent, or meeting the cost of a new school year’s uniform, or watching the forecast to try to ration out heating. Hard-working families are being punished by this UK Government after a decade of austerity and a decade of a complete lack of interest in or care about those struggling to get by on the lowest of pay. That is why Labour is calling for the Government to change course and cancel the cut, drop the jobs tax hike on working people and businesses, and urgently explore further measures to help households alleviate the cost of rising bills, including the option of making automatic and extending the Warm Homes Discount. Pushing more people into poverty, widening health inequalities with ill-heated homes and not enough money for good food is not going to help the economy recover; it will simply mean greater pressures on the NHS and greater pressures on social services.</p>

    <title>Weekly Round Up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/09/24/weekly-round-up-5/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-round-up-5" type="text/html"/>

<p>I was pleased to be on the panel at the launch of the No Place Left Behind report from the Commission on Prosperity and Community Placeholding on Monday, where we discussed the importance of giving communities new powers in efforts to ‘level up’ left behind neighbourhoods. Top-down projects rarely work because their leaders simply cannot understand the specific needs of local communities and cannot implement effective tools to enact change. The importance of local knowledge and lived experience should not be underestimated. I found it striking that the report noted how important it was for people to live within a short distance of good quality shops for groceries and that this can boost the wellbeing of constituents. In order for this to happen, we need to look at business rates and ensure that in poorer parts of the country, we are not hindering growth before it can even begin by placing shop premises financially out of reach for local sellers.  I look forward to continuing these discussions.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I was able to put a question to the Home Office Minister on the epidemic we are facing of violence against women and girls. I agreed with the recent police report recommendation that violence against women and girls be treated with the same degree of importance as countering terrorism. Resources are a huge factor in this. We cannot expect police to fight this epidemic with the paltry resources that they currently have at their disposal. If this Government are serious about countering violence against women and girls, then they need to give the police have the tools to do the job. The Home Office must ensure that there is a national programme to tackle this and that local forces are not simply left to deal with this epidemic of violence themselves. </p>
<p>It’s once again been a busy week on the Committee for the Health Bill. We’ve been looking at transparency and independent scrutiny of local services. It is so important that patients can see where money is being spent in their local health services and how decisions about provision are being made.  For that to be the case, there must be independent scrutiny with access to the appropriate information and the ability to challenge decisions that are at odds with the needs of the community. The NHS faces many challenges, but more transparency will help us identify areas of difficulty and implement the necessary change to make improvements. </p>
<p>We have also been looking at the important issue of workforce planning and the importance of training local people. Fairly recently, the Government expanded medical training places in parts of the country where there is a low take-up, and to which people are not moving to work. We know that if we train people locally, they stay local and if the Government would like a quick and easy way to level up—however they want to define it—that is it. If we want our young people to stay in their local areas to work, we need to offer them the jobs and training that enable them to do so. It’s not fair that for young people to get a job they have to move away from their homes, their families, and their friends. It’s also not fair on their local communities who lose that talent and youthful enthusiasm! We need healthcare workers within our communities but that only happens when we offer the training and provide the jobs to build that care within the community. </p>
<p>I have introduced an amendment to the Bill on end-of-life care which we discussed this week. As someone with a longstanding interest in this issue, I believe that this Bill must make provision for anyone with a terminal illness diagnosis to be offered a conversation about what the diagnosis means to them and how the health service can support them at the end of their life.  At this point, a patient’s needs are not merely medical, so the conversation needs to include support on understanding and deciding on their treatment, on support for their mental wellbeing, financial and practical support to ensure that they are prepared, and support with their social relationships. These conversations are by nature incredibly difficult, but they are also necessary. Healthcare does not stop because medicine can not save us and clear guidance on what this means is vital to ensure that all patients are treated with respect and dignity until the end. </p>
<p>I was pleased to join the Advanced Construction Skills Centre launch today with the Mayor of the West of England, Dan Norris. The £9 million investment in this Skills Centre is a wonderful opportunity for the young people in South Bristol and I am pleased that higher apprenticeship courses will be offered alongside construction courses for trades in wood, brick, and plaster for both young people and those looking to retrain or build on their current qualifications. We need centres like this around the country to develop our vocational capacity, to provide young people with the trades and skills that will help them into well paid jobs, and to show a commitment to ensuring that learning a trade is given the same level of investment and respect as learning in an academic setting. Both are vital for the prosperity of this country and both are needed to help our towns and communities recover from a decade of austerity and the pandemic. </p>

    <title>£499 million to build thousands of new affordable homes across the East Midlands</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mattwarman.co.uk/2021/08/31/499-million-to-build-thousands-of-new-affordable-homes-across-the-east-midlands/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boston &amp;amp; Skegness will benefit from a £499 million investment to build 9,775 new affordable homes across the East Midlands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This funding has been allocated through the Conservative Government’s £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme, the largest single investment in affordable housing in a decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nearly 120,000 new homes will be built for young people and families – supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and helping more first-time buyers into home ownership to level up communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Warman MP has welcomed the £499m investment to deliver 9,775 new affordable homes across the East Midlands through the Conservative Government’s Affordable Homes Programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total £8.6 billion investment across England will help to build 119,000 new affordable homes, including 57,000 for ownership, 29,600 for social rent and 6,250 affordable rural homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new affordable homes available for ownership will help more young people and families to get a foot on the housing ladder, building on other schemes from the Conservative Government to help first-time buyers into homeownership, including First Homes – offering new homes at a 30 per cent discount on the open market value – and the 95 per cent mortgage guarantee scheme – which helps first-time buyers secure a mortgage with just a 5 per cent deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 30,000 homes for Social Rent – which are typically 50 to 60 per cent of market prices – will provide secure, affordable housing to people who need it most. It will also deliver new supported housing for some of the most vulnerable, providing much needed homes for older or disabled people with support needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investment is expected to support up to 370,000 construction jobs across the country for the home building industry including SME developers, major housebuilders and infrastructure specialists as well as the wider local economies – expecting to generate up to £26 billion of wider private and public investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the Conservative Government has delivered over 542,400 new affordable homes – and this investment marks an important step towards meeting its promise to deliver 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Matt Warman said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Owning your own home should not be the privilege of a few, but an affordable possibility for young people and families across Boston &amp;amp; Skegness and around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted thousands of people across the East Midlands will now have their dream of home ownership realised through the Affordable Homes Programme, with 9,775 homes delivered thanks to the Conservative Government’s £499million investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By helping more people and their families buy a home in their local area, we are levelling up opportunity across the country – while creating good skilled jobs as we build back better from the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creating more opportunities for home ownership is central to this government. This £9 billion funding is a landmark moment for our Affordable Homes Programme and will ensure good quality housing for all as we build back better after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This huge funding package will make the ambition of owning a home a reality for families by making it realistic and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are also ensuring tens of thousands of new homes for rent are built in the years ahead, including social rent, so those on the lowest incomes can enjoy good quality, secure rented homes, built and managed by reputable providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launching our £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme to provide 180,000 new homes across the country, helping extend the dream of homeownership to as many people as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Delivering over 5 years from 2021 to 2026, our £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme will provide up to 180,000 new homes across the country, should economic conditions allow. The programme will also unlock a further £38 billion in public and private investment in affordable housing, with new homes being made available from next year (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jenrick-unveils-huge-12-billion-boost-for-affordable-homes"&gt;MHCLG, Press Release, 8 September 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing £8.5 billion to build 119,000 new affordable homes across England, the single largest investment in affordable housing for a decade.&lt;/strong&gt; We are making £8.5 billion available through our £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme to every region across England, which will help deliver 119,000 new affordable homes – building on the over 542,400 new affordable homes we have delivered since 2010 (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/86-billion-for-affordable-homes-to-give-boost-onto-housing-ladder"&gt;MHCLG, Press Release, 31 August 2021&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds on our efforts to deliver the homes our communities need by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing total government investment in new housing to almost £20 billion.&lt;/strong&gt; The £7.1 billion National Home Building Fund will deliver our long-term housing strategy by unlocking 860,000 homes over the next four years – this sits alongside the £11.5 billion we are making available through the Affordable Homes Programme between 2021 and 2026 (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents"&gt;HMT, Spending Review 2020, 25 November 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the highest number of new homes in over 20 years, helping more people get onto the property ladder.&lt;/strong&gt; There were nearly 50,000 completed homes in the first quarter of 2021 – the highest figure in over 20 years and a 4 per cent increase compared to the last three months of 2020. During the same period, over 46,000 home builds were started, the highest number in nearly 15 years and a 7 per cent increase on the previous quarter (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-building-stats-show-continued-increase-in-starts-and-completions-despite-pandemic"&gt;MHCLG, Press Release, 1 July 2021&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering over 1.8 million homes since 2010, as we oversee a seventh consecutive year that the number of homes built has increased.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2019-20, we delivered 243,770 homes – the highest number in a single year since 1978 – representing the seventh consecutive year in a row that the number of homes delivered has increased. With 90 per cent comprising of new builds, this takes the total number of homes we have delivered to 1.8 million since 2010 (&lt;a href="https://www.buyassociation.co.uk/2020/12/04/housebuilding-soars-to-a-33-year-high-in-england/"&gt;Buy Association, 4 December 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Emma Meets with Tyne Tunnel 2 Executives</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.emma-lewell-buck.net/emma-meets-with-tyne-tunnel-2-executives/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I met with the Chief Exec and Operations Manager of Tyne Tunnel 2 to raise concerns following a spike in complaints about the tunnel operators since the introduction of the controversial “pay later” scheme. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with many of the complaints, I believe that the payment instructions could be clearer. The ticket states a date and a time however, if you wait until the date shown, it’ll be too late and you’ll incur a £30 fine, I can see how many people are easily misunderstanding what the ticket says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, I asked the Chief Executive, Phill Smith if he could look at other options and suggested changes should be made to the wording on the tickets to make it clearer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I learnt about plans for the tunnel to remove the barriers completely in a new system called&amp;nbsp;Open Road Tolling.&amp;nbsp; This would mean that there would be no barriers and payments will need to be made either using an online account or the pay later option. Tyne Tunnel 2 say this would increase tunnel capacity, reduce carbon emissions and mean more a more reliable and quicker journey through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I again expressed concern that more drivers may receive fines, as the onus would be&amp;nbsp;on drivers to remember to pay the toll as under the new system, they would not receive a ticket which in many cases acts as a reminder. I also asked what facilities have TT2 put in place to support those drivers who do not have access to the internet, in order to pay their toll charge. It was explained that drivers who do not have smart phones or access to the internet could pay their toll at shops who have a PayPoint facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I feel many constituents’ pain and frustration. Many people have told me that the current system of pay later is confusing and lacks clarity, I agree and will continue to seek a resolution to this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Coronavirus issues and other local matters.<br/>
<strong><br/>
International Travel</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I have been asked by a number of people about the current rules for travel outside the UK and returning here. To find out what the rules are for entering any other country, you should look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Office Travel Advice</a>, which will tell you what the entry requirements are at the moment in each country.</p>
<p>For re-entering the UK, all of the current advice is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>South Western Railway &amp; Network Rail Timetable Consultation</strong></p>
<p>South Western Railway and Network Rail have launched a consultation about their plans for the post-Pandemic timetable from December 2022 onwards. This consultation is based on an assumption that considerably fewer people will be commuting going forward. The proposals represent a significant downgrading of the pre-pandemic timetable for our line into London Waterloo. They are intending to reduce the number of trains from Ashtead and Epsom in the peak from six trains an hour to four. This would be done by scrapping the services that start at Epsom and making the previous semi-fast service stop at Ewell West and Stoneleigh instead, as well as at all stations further in. At the same time they would make the current reduction in off-peak services permanent.</p>
<p>They will also at the same time introduce the new generation of trains onto our line, which are ten coaches with all of them connected to create an open plan route right through the train. Their argument is that the new trains will have significantly more capacity and will be able to carry as many people as before even with a reduced service. I do not buy that argument. I have met the company to raise my concerns about the plans, and I think it is much too early to judge what passenger numbers will be in nearly eighteen months time. This level of service would have been completely unworkable with pre-pandemic passenger numbers. I would encourage everyone to take part in the consultation and to make your view clear. The details are at <strong><a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/timetables/timetable-consultation-december-2022">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom &amp; Ewell Business Awards 2011-2021</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Epsom and Ewell Business Awards have just been launched for online entries and nominations. This will be the tenth year of the awards, and it’s a great opportunity to nominate your favourite local business, perhaps because of what they have done for you during the pandemic or because they just always look after you really well. Details of how to enter or nominate an entry are <strong><a href="https://www.epsombusinessawards.co.uk/">here</a></strong>. Please do get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering in the Local Community</strong></p>
<p>I know that many people locally put their names forward to volunteer in the community during the pandemic, and either have now finished that work or did not find the right opportunity to do so. If you are someone who is motivated to get involved or frustrated because your help wasn’t needed, I am planning a volunteering event to match potential volunteers with a small group of local charities who need extra help.</p>
<p>The event will be at <strong>St George’s, in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead on Friday 10th September</strong> from 4 until 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I will be sending out more details a few days before, but if you are interested please make a note in your diary.</p>
<p>I hope that you manage to enjoy something of a break this summer and that the weather improves.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br/>
Chris</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my July&nbsp;email newsletter. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well during this challenging time, as we start to try to return to normality from the pandemic and enjoy the Summer, whilst still trying to be cautious and sensible with precautions where possible&nbsp;in the face of rising cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is only right that at this critical juncture in our journey out of lockdown, we take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices of the wonderful people who make up our NHS, our key workers, and all those involved in the vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you&#8217;ll find updates on the latest cases and vaccination restrictions, a link to my new online survey and details of what&#8217;s been happening in Parliament and around Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Online Summer Survey – let me know your views:</u></strong></p>



<p>As we head towards Summer Recess in Parliament, I’m about to start delivering my annual report across Amber Valley – please say hello if you see me out and about.</p>



<p>In the report and online, I’m launching a survey to get your views on local issues and recovering from Covid-19, from health appointments to boosting our economy.</p>



<p>Please take just a couple of minutes to complete my Summer Survey and let me know your views <a href="https://www.nigelmillsmp.com/nigels-summer-survey/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing Lockdown Restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 19<sup>th </sup>July 2021, the Government lifted all remaining restrictions on social distancing in England. This represents a further step towards normality as we adjust to living with this virus. Although coronavirus cases are continuing to rise nationally, we have not seen the corresponding rise in hospitalisations and deaths that we would expect given the rates of illness we observed last year. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly clear that the link between infections and serious illness is sufficiently broken to enable this further relaxation of restrictions. However, we must remain careful and exercise our own good judgement to keep transmission in our local community to a minimum.</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Case Rates</u></strong></p>



<p>The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant continues to spread across the country and Public Health England (PHE) is now confident that it has overtaken the Alpha variant to become the most dominant strain of the virus circulating in the UK. The Delta variant is believed to be around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which itself is more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. Encouragingly however, new analysis by PHE shows that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.</p>



<p>As predicted in light of this, cases continue to rise nationally, and this trend is no different locally in Amber Valley. You can find the latest case data <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read?postcode=DE7%206DG">here</a>. We are now ahead of the England average which highlights the need for us to remain careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Vaccines</u></strong></p>



<p>The Country’s vaccine program continues apace with more than 46.2 million people in the UK having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine &#8211; part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.</p>



<p>I was pleased to see the rollout expanded after the Government hit its target of offering a first jab to everyone in the top priority groups &#8211; all those over the age of 50, plus those in high-risk categories by mid-April. With every adult in the UK now having been offered their first dose of the vaccine. A terrific effort, nationally and locally.</p>



<p>As of last Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> July, Amber Valley had successfully given at least one dose of the vaccine to 88% of local adults, with 72.8% having received both jabs. This remains slightly above the average for England which stands at 87.7% of adults having received one jab, and 68% both jabs. These figures are a testament to the exemplary vaccine program here in our constituency.</p>



<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team, and the local NHS to ensure that this area continues to see the full roll out of vaccines.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing of restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>As of Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July, all legal restrictions on social distancing in England have been lifted. This is truly excellent news, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing Amber Valley businesses, organisations, and individuals operating at full capacity without legal restrictions.</p>



<p>The following measures are now in place across England:</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on how many people can meet.</p>



<p>&#8211; 1m-plus rule removed (except in some places like hospitals).</p>



<p>&#8211; Face coverings no longer required by law.</p>



<p>&#8211; Nightclubs can open.</p>



<p>&#8211; Pubs and restaurants no longer table service only.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on guests at weddings and funerals.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on people attending concerts, theatres or sports events.</p>



<p>&#8211; No restrictions on communal worship.</p>



<p>It is important to remember, however, that this easing of restrictions is designed to empower ourselves as individuals to use our common sense to slow the spread of the virus, which is still very present in our communities. Therefore, I implore you to enjoy these new freedoms responsibly.</p>



<p>As ever, to find out more information on what restrictions apply in your area please look <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting our local economy</u></strong></p>



<p>As we try to re-open, it&#8217;s key to support our local economy to bounce back, and provide a boost to local jobs and businesses. Unemployment is Amber Valley is currently at 4.2%, which is below the national average of 5.6% and 150 lower than in May 2021. As the Job Retention Scheme (furlough) starts to wind down, we need to remain cautious, but there are lots of vacancies around and local employers advertising job opportunities, including the Kickstart Scheme to help young people get back into work. I&#8217;ll also look to organise a Job Fair, maybe initially virtually, over the next few months &#8211; please get in touch if you&#8217;d like to be involved in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Borders Bill</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve recently welcomed the Government’s New Plan for Immigration, also known as the Borders Bill, into parliament. This legislation intends to:</p>



<ul><li>Speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals.</li><li>Introduce maximum life sentences for people smugglers.</li><li>Empower the Border Force to do more to stop and seize small boats and search containers for hidden migrants.</li><li>Stop illegal arrivals gaining immediate entry into the asylum system if they have travelled through a safe county (like France).</li><li>Increase the maximum sentence for illegally entering the UK.</li><li>Grant resettled refugees indefinite leave to remain.</li><li>Better integrate refugees who are resettled.</li></ul>



<p>I know constituents want more to be done to reduce illegal immigration. I will, therefore, continue to engage with ministers throughout this Bill’s journey through parliament to ensure the Government delivers on its manifesto commitments of reducing illegal immigration to UK.</p>



<p><strong><u>In Parliament:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament this month, I&#8217;ve been asking questions on travel restrictions, catch-up education and English Votes for English Laws legislation.</p>



<p>During recent questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, I raised the issue on behalf of constituents of families with children under 18 wanting to travel abroad, but who aren&#8217;t eligible for the vaccine as yet. I&#8217;m pleased the Secretary of State agreed to look into this issue, and you can find out more on his answer <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-19b.670.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g680.4">here</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also asked the Secretary of State for Education about catch-up tutoring for school pupils following the pandemic, and you can find the full debate on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-06c.768.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g776.0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, during Business Questions in the House, I asked about the continuation of English Votes for English Laws legislation, as part of a continued fair settlement of devolution across the UK. You can find more on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-06-24b.1011.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1023.2">here</a>&nbsp;and on my Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/nigelmills">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also find more on my recent parliamentary appearances and questions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pid=24965&amp;pop=1#n4">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Solar Farm</u></strong></p>



<p>Locally, I’ve been working with local residents and councillors to help oppose plans to construct a 310-acre solar farm on a vast swathe of green space between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. The solar farm has been proposed by Kronos Solar and is subject to several planning applications across Amber Valley Borough Council and North East Derbyshire District Council. I think this would destroy our local landscape due it&#8217;s scale and extent, so whilst I&#8217;m not against renewable energy or solar panels, I think these applications are inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The applications are still awaiting determination by the councils (likely to be in September) so there&#8217;s still time to comment or lodge any concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find details of the residents&#8217; objection group, and information on the individual applications and how to comment if you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savealfretoncountryside/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council Local Plan consultation &#8211; Have your say!</u></strong></p>



<p>The new administration at the Borough Council has launched a new consultation on the next stage of preparing Amber Valley&#8217;s Local Plan, a development document which will set out and plan future housing growth in the area, and making sure we have the infrastructure improvements to match any new homes. I welcome the planned reduction in the overall number of new homes being proposed, which is part of the consultation. The Council are also consulting on the options for the overall strategy (spatial strategy) of the plan, which include focusing housing growth on the Derby City urban area border, in and around Amber Valley&#8217;s four key towns, or in the wider area and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation on the proposals and headline strategy for the plan so far is open from now until the 30th September 2021. Please do take opportunity to feed in your views to the Council &#8211; I know how strongly residents rightly feel over housing in our area, and so this is the most important chance to have your say on making sure we protect our Green Belt and shaping&nbsp;the future of planning in our area. You can find the consultation and how to submit your views on the proposals <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/alternative-spatial-strategy-options-for-housing-and-economic-growth/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Street Watch:</u></strong></p>



<p>As always, if there are any street repairs in your area, such as potholes, pavement repairs or broken street lights, you can report these issues and concerns to me quickly and easily&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/street-watch/">here</a> so I can ask for the repairs to be investigated and addressed.</p>

    <title>“Universal Credit uplift should be permanent” says city councillor</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2021/07/22/universal-credit-uplift-should-be-permanent-says-city-councillor/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;In response to a question at July Full Council, the Portfolio Holder for Finance and Resources has called on the Government to retain the £20 a week uplift in Universal Credit&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;highlighting how it supports many low paid working people in Nottingham.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham and in response to the pandemic in April last year the Government introduced an increase in payments of £20 a week. There is growing speculation that the Government will reverse the uplift later this year resulting in increasing difficulty for many people who are already struggling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to a question at Full Council on the issue, Cllr Sam Webster said “Universal Credit supports low paid working people in our city, tens of thousands of children in our city and people who are entitled to support with housing costs or have lost their job during the Covid pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cllr Webster commenting on the
consequences of the £20 a week uplift being reversed warned that “It will often
be felt most acutely by Nottingham children who are growing up in families
where there already isn’t much money around, families who are living in
poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January this year Nottingham City Council passed a motion urging the Government to retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit and urging an extension of the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support. This was followed up by a letter from the Leader of Nottingham City Council to the Chancellor emphasising the importance of the £20 a week uplift. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cllr Webster continued his response by saying “Lower paid and lower skilled working people are much more likely to have lost their job, not be able to work from home, have additional childcare needs, have gone through periods of Covid isolation without receiving pay, have lost hours at work&amp;#8230;.and the list goes on.&amp;nbsp;Reducing Universal Credit now would be big blow to many families who are already struggling to make ends meet.” He also argued that the uplift in Universal Credit should be seen as a litmus test for how seriously the Government is about levelling, saying to not make the uplift permanent would be a case of “levelling down”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cllr Webster ended by saying “In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago it was (and still is) shameful that the poorest people in this country were made to pay the price of mistakes made by the wealthiest. In terms of the policies that our national politicians pursue &amp;#8211; this is one of those markers &amp;#8211; who will The Conservative Government expect to pay for this latest economic and public debt crisis?&amp;nbsp; The message from Labour in Nottingham is crystal clear &amp;#8211; let it not be the poorest families again.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There seems to be a webinar for everything — from cooking an apple pie and setting up your email list to creating a company and making your first million. This form of interaction with the target audience became popular for a good reason. It allows to achieve numerous goals:</p>

<p>And that’s we’ve just scratched the surface. Every person who creates a webinar has their own unique goals in mind. This wide array of benefits is what makes webinars such a great way to promote your brand.</p>

<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-166" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"/></figure>



<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: “Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.”</p>

<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

    <title>Brexit Deal or No Deal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/01/02/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>New Hospital in Sutton Confirmed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.scully.org.uk/news/new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=new-hospital-in-sutton-confirmed" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a &lt;strong&gt;£500 MILLION plan&lt;/strong&gt; that will not only &lt;strong&gt;build a brand new state of the art hospital&lt;/strong&gt; near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO &lt;strong&gt;invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: &lt;a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk"&gt;hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with me with any queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp;amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why is this being done?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier closing?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is a new hospital being built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is St Helier getting an upgrade?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who developed these proposals?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&amp;#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Will we still use St Helier?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about bed numbers?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about A&amp;amp;E?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What about maternity services?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will children services be provided?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Where will the new hospital be built?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;amp;E @ the Glam &amp;#8211; Strength in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;amp;E departments&lt;br /&gt;
and bring services closer to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.&lt;br /&gt;

<p><strong><em>“I’m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn’t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>“We’re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government’s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan’s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We’re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we’re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.”</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p></div>

    <title>Two thirds of Wolverhampton pensioners lose free TV licence</title>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden – in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

    <title>Mhairi Black to Young People: Don’t let the Tories leave you behind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://mhairiblack.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/mhairi-black-to-young-people-dont-let-the-tories-leave-you-behind/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"/><br/>
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>“A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who’ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>“The SNP are already delivering for Scotland’s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>“The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so important that young people turn up and vote – don’t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>“Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations – we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>– We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>– We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>– SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>– In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>– To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>– We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>– We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>– We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

    <title>The refugee crisis</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.matthewpennycook.com/2015/09/12/the-refugee-crisis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over recent days I’ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It’s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s ‘Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,’ begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people’s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees – both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe’s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br/>
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

    <title type="text">On being a woman in politics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/"&gt;Counting Women In campaign&lt;/a&gt;, couldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876"&gt;outrageous attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. &lt;i&gt;I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (&lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224"&gt;not great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376"&gt;by some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be &lt;a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955"&gt;no barrier to reselection&lt;/a&gt;), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301"&gt;Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: &amp;quot;Trebuchet MS&amp;quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"&gt;Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being &lt;i&gt;"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eilidh has written &lt;a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114"&gt;a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
