<p>The Commons is half way through its closing debates on the Health and Care Bill.</p>
<p>I have concerns about both main elements of the legislation.  The first concern the extensive reorganisation of NHS England. This gives legislative force to the  creation of Integrated Care Boards and Integrated Care Partnerships. These bodies are  being set up to change the landscape of purchasing services from the NHS trusts, GP partnerships  and other providers. They bring together various  budgets, decide on what they need to provide for their area and divide up the budget to seek to procure what is needed.</p>
<p>I am not clear as to how they will  be better than the Clinical Commissioning Groups they replace  nor see why their boundaries have been configured as they are. There are big variations in geographical area and populations covered by these bodies. They need to hit the ground running now, as they have a big job to supervise the expenditures of large and increasing sums of money with a view to providing high quality care throughout England, and to bring waiting lists and times down to more acceptable levels. My concern is too much time and resource might go into reorganisation when we need it to be pushed to the front line to provide the extra treatments and care needed by the large influx of patients.</p>
<p>The second concern is about the social care reform. I have written and spoken before about the need to put raising the quality of care and supplying enough of it to the fore of the consideration, rather than the vexed issue of how much people need to pay for themselves where they have assets. For many years there has been cross party support for the proposition that all frail elderly people should get their health care free as part of the NHS pledge, but should pay for their own board and lodging where they can afford to do so. It has meant that where someone moves into a Care home leaving their old home empty it is usual for it to be sold and for them to pay for their hotel costs at the Care Home from their own resources.</p>
<p>There have been some who suggest that placing a cap on care costs will free many people from having to sell their homes to pay the bills, but this does not cover the costs of board and lodging which can be considerable. There is a danger that some will think this new system and legislation will free their families from the need to sell a home and spend the proceeds, when in many cases there will still  be substantial bills that people need to self fund. There is also the danger that the introduction of a Care Tax , starting at around 1.25% on National Insurance, will make people think social care is cheap. In practice this tax will pay for around one fifth of the total state costs of social care.</p>
<p>There needs to be more discussion and more consideration of what social care will look like in five years time, and how we will all help pay for it.</p>

<p>I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Before we leave the subject of the cap, can he just confirm that this proposal includes the costs of domiciliary care, which had not been included under the original Dilnot proposals that are exercising Labour Members?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is exactly right. I am grateful to him for giving me an opportunity to highlight that this improves in this respect on the Dilnot proposals. I put on record my tribute to Andrew Dilnot for his work, but we believe that this is a better package, and, as he highlighted, a sustainable package from a financial perspective.</p>

<p>I spoke to BBC Radio Leicester about the real concerns that Labour have with the Government&#8217;s proposals on care costs.</p>
<p>At a time when we have terrible frontline staff shortages, that family carers are being pushed to breaking point, and that disabled people can&#8217;t get the help they need to live an independent life, the Prime Minister is protecting the homes of the wealthy.</p>
<p>Why should ordinary people have to pay more, so the wealthy don&#8217;t have to sell their homes?</p>
<p>Listen to my comments today above.</p>

<p>On the floor of the House of Commons this afternoon, Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed to meet with local MP Tim Farron and Lake District hospitality leaders to address the urgent staffing crisis in the industry.</p>
<p>The latest research conducted by Cumbria Tourism found that 85% of businesses in the sector are struggling with recruitment issues.</p>
<p>Speaking during Home Office questions in Parliament today, Tim said: <em>"80% of the working age population living in the Lake District already works in hospitality and tourism.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"So the Home Secretary will see there is therefore no reservoir of domestic labour available to fill the gap left by her restrictive new visa rules.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Will she recognise that we have a special case in the Lake District - we are the biggest visitor destination in the country outside London, with one of the smallest populations?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Would she meet with me and tourism industry chiefs in the Lakes and the Dales so that we can come up with a Youth Mobility Visa with European countries so we can solve the problem and get our economy working again?"</em>
</p>
<p>In response, Priti Patel said: <em>"If I may say so I would like to praise his hospitality sector because obviously he represents a very beautiful part of the country and of course we want hospitality and tourism to thrive across the United Kingdom.</em></p>
<p>"<em>I'd be delighted with my colleagues to meet not only him but his hospitality sector.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"What I would also say is that youth mobility is not just an EU matter, it's now a global matter and through much of the work we are doing with countries outside of the EU, there's a great deal of work being done on youth mobility schemes."</em>

Catherine McKinnell, Member of Parliament for Newcastle North, has criticised Conservative social care proposals. On Friday, the Government released details of their social care cap, which will put a cap of £86,000 on lifetime social care costs. This means that people with modest assets risk losing all or most of their wealth if they need &#8230; <a href="https://www.catherinemckinnellmp.co.uk/social-care-another-broken-promise/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">SOCIAL CARE ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE FROM THIS CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

<p>For the past couple of years I have run the Reverse Advent Calendar event to support local foodbanks, food pantry&#8217;s and community cafe&#8217;s in our local area. This year will be no different. As we draw into the winter months, time&#8217;s will get harder for many families, and I would ask anyone who can, to offer some support. </p>



<p>All the instructions are provided in the images above, and this year we are supporting the Yardley Wood Pantry based at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ywbaptists/?__cft__[0]=AZVrHwEpUeOIPw9z-iCZFj_basVetkV4DHDHkOxdgvAeBQPulDS8XtHbVn8ypzc6Hvai2GYYRG9xFnp0c6urDGvFdkIoUk8uVSPwkyFgAp_grHnQ59p_uL_565tsHDIL_lLA3zFTiyMISKxyii2mwQ2qSvCLJPKkieQjsrtNaTMj4h7TeHMTMQUHp4QZbXzQ56M&amp;__tn__=kK-R">Yardley Wood Baptist Church</a> and the Spearhead Trust supported by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theaws/?__cft__[0]=AZVrHwEpUeOIPw9z-iCZFj_basVetkV4DHDHkOxdgvAeBQPulDS8XtHbVn8ypzc6Hvai2GYYRG9xFnp0c6urDGvFdkIoUk8uVSPwkyFgAp_grHnQ59p_uL_565tsHDIL_lLA3zFTiyMISKxyii2mwQ2qSvCLJPKkieQjsrtNaTMj4h7TeHMTMQUHp4QZbXzQ56M&amp;__tn__=kK-R">The Active Wellbeing Society</a> &#8211; they have asked for Christmas donations to be received by the 20th of December </p>

<p>MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar Angus MacNeil is to meet with the Hebridean Housing Partnership (HHP) in the coming weeks regarding concerns over housing on the islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: &nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;At the recent Western Isles Fishermen’s AGM concerns were raised about the lack of housing in Leverburgh. Following that meeting I wrote to HHP raising the need for greater accessibility to housing in Leverburgh and in other areas and was delighted to learn from HHP that they are indeed conducting a feasibility study in Leverburgh.</p>



<p>“HHP tell me that they are currently researching and will reporting on the housing needs in Leverburgh with a view to building. I hope that they do go ahead and build in Leverburgh but I understand that they have to go through their procedures.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is right that HHP do their processes of diligence, but it is also right that voices in the community that probably instinctively know what is required, are given due weight as well. I am amplifying these voices and calling for houses to be built in Leverburgh to meet the needs of the community, businesses and all.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday evening, as a member of the Petitions Committee, I was honoured and privileged to <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-11-15/debates/2F33B858-4F79-42CA-9544-790886B089C1/RoadTrafficOffencesFatalCollisions#contribution-47F3A20E-4FBB-401C-9AA1-EF1597D8A940">lead a petitions debate in Westminster Hall</a> on road traffic offences for fatal collisions. I met the petitioners virtually last week, in person on the afternoon of the debate, and they sat in the public gallery to listen to the debate. When we met, I listened to their heartbreaking stories, which reduced me to tears. I cannot pretend to understand the depth of their grief, but I commend their courage and tenacity in wanting something good to come out of their grief. Louise Smyth and Helen Wood are calling for tougher sentences for hit and run drivers who cause death. Their petition received 104,324 signatures. Louise and Helen both tragically lost their sons, Mark and Paul, aged 25 and 23, in separate motorbike collisions within 9 months of each other. The collisions were caused by drivers who fled the scene, leaving Mark and Paul dying in the road. The maximum penalty for failing to stop and report an accident, also called a hit and run, is a 6-month custodial sentence, whereas causing death by careless/dangerous driving is between 5-14 years. It is no surprise that those in favour of a change in the law say that there is a perverse incentive for a driver who is under the influence of drink or drugs to leave the scene of a traffic collision, thereby avoiding a drink and drugs test by the police. If they hand themselves in to the police later, they cannot be tested because of the time that has elapsed and are likely to avoid a more serious offence or penalty.</p>
<p>Leanne Saltern started a petition entitled Ryan’s Law in memory of her brother Ryan. The petition calls for the UK Government to widen the definition of death by dangerous driving to include failure to stop, call 999, and render aid on the scene until further help arrives. Leanne’s petition received 164,470 signatures.</p>
<p>The petitioners, and many more families who have lost loved ones in road traffic collisions, do not want any more warm words and empty rhetoric from the UK Government. They want the law to be changed.</p>
<p>I read a portfolio compiled by Leanne Saltern that features hundreds of families who have contacted her after losing a loved one in circumstances similar to those of the petitioners. It made me cry. No sentence will ever make up for the tragic loss of a loved one, and families have been constantly told that reform will be introduced when parliamentary time allows. The time is now. I am calling on the UK Government to change the law, as set out in the petitions, and to meet the petitioners and other families in order to give them the opportunity to be heard. They must be heard.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I was delighted to deliver the guest speech at the <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/fbU1CK13nCVBrKGiMaiek?domain=youtu.be">35<sup>th</sup> anniversary</a> of the Cooperazione Finanza Impressa, CFI, which delivers Marcora Law in Italy on behalf of the Italian Government. The CFI has made investments of 300 million euros in 560 companies saving the jobs of 25,000 workers, guaranteeing employment and retaining work skills and experience. Marcora Law was established in Italy by the former Industry Minister Giovanni Marcora to give workers the right and financial support to buy out all, or parts of, an at-risk business, and establish it as a worker owned co-operative. I delivered my speech virtually because the anniversary was held in Rome. I spoke about my Westminster Hall debate where I urged the UK Government to introduce Marcora Law into legislation. The CEO of CFI Camillo De Berardinis had watched my Westminster Hall debate and then very kindly extended an invitation to me to speak at the anniversary. Camillo and I shall work together to campaign for a UK Marcora Law.</p>
<p>As Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Sport, I co-chaired a joint virtual meeting with Derek Twigg MP, the Chair of the APPG for Mountaineering, about the effects of Brexit on the sport and recreation sector. We heard from guest speakers: Tom Cloke, Chair of the Alpine Sports Group; Nick Chamberlain, Policy Manager of British Cycling; and Martin Doyle, President of British Mountain Guides, before opening up to people on the call for a Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement, UK Nationals can only spend 90 out of 180 days in a EU country. There are certain exemptions for elite athletes, for example tennis players, but grassroots players on talent pathways, and coaches and support staff who spent 6 months in a winter or summer season on the continent, learning and earning a good reputation can no longer do so, and as a result become less qualified in their chosen sport. A visa is required for each separate EU country which is costly, time consuming, and deterring young athletes and coaches from performing in the EU.</p>
<p>Tom said that Brexit was bad for his sport because it affected and diminished the 5 Rs: Revenue, Reputation, Retention, Recruitment and Results. And Snowsports was developed by GB from holiday recreation into a racing sport, and mobility across the EU is critical. Tom advocated: short-term permits; increased mobility for named professional sport doubling from 90 in 180 days to 180 in 360 days; and UK-EU youth mobility schemes.</p>
<p>Nick said that Brexit prevented summer alpine mountain bike guides working seasonally, and prevents young men and women spending one or two years gaining valuable experience racing for a continental team. Youngsters are funded through Lottery and the Dave Reiner Charity, but the 90 days maximum makes this impossible and 3-400 young people have left the sport because they cannot achieve their ambitions, and this has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of youngsters and their families.</p>
<p>Martin said that mountain guides needed to have experience on the bigger mountains in the EU, because British mountains are much smaller. They need flexibility of access because it’s a seasonal occupation and the weather varies so much between EU countries. Brexit has caused eligibility and permission problems. 70% of his members need to move across borders to work and this is not permitted, plus there are no work permits for the self-employed, which are in the majority. His members need to work in EU countries in order to be able to accept each other’s qualifications.</p>
<p>There was commonality between speakers and contributors from other sports who took part in the meeting, that we should campaign for the recent concession made to UK musicians, which provided work-free visas to touring musicians across the EU, to be extended to the sports sector.</p>
<p>On Tuesday lunchtime, I was thrilled to meet Joanna Lumley to discuss the Stop Sea Blasts campaign. The First and Second World War have left a legacy of 100,000 unexploded ordinances in our waters. These bombs, mines and shells need to be cleared for the construction of offshore wind farms, which is done by blowing up the bomb or mine. Our marine life, particularly dolphins and whales, are seriously and negatively impacted by such explosions, dependent as they are on their auditory system for navigation, feeding and communication. In 2011, at the Kyle of Durness in Scotland, 39 long-finned pilot whales were beached following nearby munitions disposals. A Government investigation found that the munition clearances were “the only external event with the potential to cause” the mass stranding.</p>
<p>But there is another way to rid our seas of these dangerous artefacts. A technology called low-order deflagration can remove munitions from the sea floor without using a damaging explosion. Instead, a small magnesium cone is fired against the munition, causing its explosive contents to ‘burn out’ from the inside with no damaging explosion and much less noise. It is vital that we clear these explosives in order to help build our green energy industry, but we need to do so in a way that does not cause such catastrophic damage to our marine life.</p>
<p>Whilst I was meeting Joanna, the UK Government announced that it will aim for undetonated explosives found in the sea to be cleared using quieter, less invasive, methods.  Joanna said that, “as far as as she understands it, for the first time, the UK Government has clearly stated that using more environmentally friendly methods of clearing these unexplored bombs, such as low order deflagration, is the way forward and that this was a victory of common sense”.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon was taken up with the Petitions Committee’s <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/event/5571/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/">second evidence session</a> for our enquiry on tackling online abuse. The enquiry is focusing on lived experiences of people receiving online abuse on social media in relation to protected characteristics; social, regulatory, and technical solutions to online abuse; and the availability and enforcement of legal penalties for online abuse. We heard from two panels of expert witnesses. Panel one was comprised of Seyi Akiwowo, founder and CEO of Glitch; Andy Burrows, Head of Child Safety Online Policy at NSPCC; and Stephen Kinsella, founder of Clean Up The Internet. Panel two had Ellen Judson, Senior Researcher at Demos; William Perrin OBE, Trustee of Carnegie UK Trust; and Dr Bertie Vidgen, Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. Committee members had the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses which lasted for over two hours, and the evidence will form part of our final report.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as a member of the Panel of Chairs, I chaired three debates in Westminster Hall. The first was secured by Nicola Richards, Conservative MP for West Bromwich East, about the use of <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-11-17/debates/37E997BA-A794-4D31-AB38-E690CA1C3F72/StopAndSearchWestMidlands#contribution-7A68C3DC-70DA-4063-80D0-45142C132366">Stop and Search in the West Midlands</a>. The second debate was moved by Jake Berry, Conservative MP for Rossendale and Darwen, and was entitled <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-11-17/debates/9F3625F3-843C-4EA7-BAEB-7878E2D891AE/FuneralDirectorServicesRegulation#contribution-A995907A-59D5-4E80-A9ED-F55F331C6DBE">Funeral Director Services Regulation</a>. The third debate was led by Tahir Ali Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green, and the subject was <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-11-17/debates/298122A6-9FF1-4EE7-872E-D9F05B330D1F/PalestineRoadMapToPeace#contribution-24671CF4-BC5D-407F-B70A-D2ACA8BDF5E5">Palestine: The Road to Peace</a>. Many MPs took part in these debates and there were some passionate speeches with some lively exchanges.</p>
<p>On Thursday I chaired two <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-11-18/debates/260f69ed-d421-432a-b37b-8bc4f47b2520/ValueAddedTax(DistanceSellingAndMiscellaneousAmendmentsNo2)Regulations2021CustomsTariff(EstablishmentAndSuspensionOfImportDuty)(EUExit)(Amendment)(No2">Delegated Legislation instruments</a>. The first was entitled The Value Added Tax (Distance Selling and Miscellaneous Amendments No 2) Regulations 2021 (SI, 2021, No. 1165). This seeks to amend the VAT Act 1994, as amended by the Finance Act 2021(FA21), which implemented two VAT simplified accounting schemes; One Stop Shop and Import One Stop Shop. These schemes are part of the e-commerce package that the UK implemented as part of the NI Protocol. These changes seek to correct several minor and consequential errors to improve clarity, and together seek to ensure that the UK’s VAT system operates as required, but do not intend to create any new regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
<p>The second instrument entitled Customs Tariff (Establishment and Suspension of Import Duty) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No 2) Regulations 2021 makes amendments to legislation previously made under the Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Act 2018 (TCTA), which provided for the UK’s Customs, VAT and Excise regimes to be in place after the end of the Implementation Period, following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. This SI seeks to make several policy updates, and it also aims to make a series of technical updates including inserting six rates of import duty in the Tariff of the United Kingdom reference document, which was omitted from previous versions of the document.</p>
<p>Both instruments were debated by members of the Delegated Legislation Committee, but were not opposed by opposition members, and so passed without any votes.</p>

<p>The Bill, which has faced a large amount of criticism from health and union leaders, will restructure large parts of the NHS, and proposes to establish 42 independently run Integrated Care Systems to cover the whole of England. Gwynne has previously written about his concerns that these ICSs may have on the already-integrated care in Tameside.</p>
<p>Critics have also argued that the Bill will pave the way for private companies in the UK to play a larger part in public healthcare services. There are no safeguards in the bill to prevent contracts being handed out without proper tendering processes, and the Bill also hands unprecedented powers to the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Bill does not make any specific references to slashing waiting times, and only references workforce planning once.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the proposed bill, Andrew Gwynne said: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the wrong bill at the wrong time, and doesn’t prioritise the things that desperately need sorting &#8211; such as record waiting lists, missed A&amp;E and cancer targets, and a totally broken social care system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, this Bill will see even more contracts awarded to private companies without proper scrutiny, and give the Health Secretary totally unnecessary powers to intervene in the operational independence of our health care system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Government has systematically underfunded the NHS for over a decade, and now risks exacerbating the problems they helped create with this poorly formulated and extremely damaging Bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am proud to be joining fellow colleagues and Unite in opposing this Bill.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jacalyn Williams, Unite national officer, added:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The Westminster government’s new Health and Care Bill is a Trojan horse for more privatisation, cronyism, austerity and a licence for politicians to run down and sell off the NHS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Attempting to drive this through whilst we are still in the middle of a pandemic and without a care for staff and patients is a disgrace, Unite is opposed to this disgraceful bill and we will lead a serious and effective campaign to ensure this bill is stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need you all to act now, wherever you work, whichever sector, community, retired, or young members we need you all to get involved and defeat these plans that will give our NHS to profiteers at the expense of staff and all patients.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I was pleased to be able to speak in the debate on COP26 in Westminster on Monday. I know there are many, many constituents who are concerned about the climate emergency and who want the Government to do more to tackle it and to make sure that the world we pass on to our children and grandchildren is safe and secure. Bristol was the first local authority in the country to declare a climate and ecological emergency. We have set out a city-wide strategy to make Bristol carbon neutral, climate resilient and wildlife rich by 2030—the nuts and bolts, if you like—but Bristol and other cities need investment, and the Government’s funding model currently makes us compete with other cities for that funding. The Government cannot reach their targets using that model, so I asked the Prime Minister to look again and to help us with the private investment that we need to make a massive contribution to the Government’s own national targets. The Prime Minister once again reiterated his commitment to reaching net zero but said that Bristol had the means to invest within the funding that we already have &#8211; I’m afraid I’m simply not convinced.</p>
<p>Later on Monday I spoke in the debate on the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill. Having gone to a further education college myself, I am a strong supporter of further education and alternative routes to higher education or skills. As chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility, I think that both FE and alternative routes are vital for better social mobility. Since becoming a Member of this House in 2015, I have spoken numerous times, including in my maiden speech, about the importance of devolution in England and post-16 education. We need to match up the opportunities that exist in my very wealthy city with the lack of opportunity that too many of my constituents face. It remains a dreadful waste of their human potential. I run an annual apprenticeships fair because I think that it is a crucial step up, particularly for those who have a poor experience of school or no history or experience of higher education. The lack of a proposal or support in the Bill for lower-level apprenticeships is a major mistake. The Government needs to think again and try to match up some of those aspirations, particularly around level 2 and level 3.</p>
<p>I raised a Point of Order this week on the issue of trailer and towing safety. The regulations, which abolish a safety test with no safety assessment (which has already happened) were debated in the Chamber last week and are opposed by many, including the Association of British Insurers and the Road Haulage Association. We talk a lot about the Government bypassing the House of Commons, and it seems extraordinary that an action of such magnitude for road safety has happened without legislation. I called for Government ministers to come to the House of Commons to explain their removal of the safety test on trailers and the legality of having done so without putting forward legislation to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>I was also in the debate on the Committee on Standards on the appalling behaviour of the Government in the last 2 weeks. Their efforts to protect an MP who had fallen foul of the rules and who showed no remorse or gave no apology for his actions were an affront to the democracy that the House of Commons is meant to represent. The Government u-turn on the subject is welcome; however that it had to come to such a moment shows just how little integrity and responsibility is shown by this Government.</p>
<p>I was pleased to round off the week visiting East Street Emporium to talk to the local designers and craftspeople working there. It is fantastic to see the collaboration that has brought so many local people together to create a business in East Street. There are some exciting developments happening with significant investment from Bristol City Council, the West of England Combined Authority, and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Bringing local traders back onto the high street and encouraging people to return to the shops and cafes is important – by visiting East Street people are helping local people and their businesses with the money going back into the community on trips out, music lessons, and meals in local restaurants rather than into the profits of huge multinationals. It was great to see some hustle and bustle back on our high street.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham has spent time at Co-op’s Hagley Road store in a show of support during the annual Respect for Shopworker’s Week. </p>
<p>Frontline shopworker’s have played a key role throughout the pandemic, however levels of violence, abuse and anti-social behaviour affecting all retailers have never been higher. </p>
<p>Retail trade union Usdaw has launched shocking statistics from their annual survey during this year’s annual Respect for Shopworkers Week, 15-21 November, and found that in the last 12 months 89% of shopworkers had experienced verbal abuse and, 64% had been threatened by a customer. While the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium’s (BRC) Annual Crime Survey showed that violence and abuse against staff has risen to over 450 incidents a day. </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP, said: “It was a pleasure to visit Co-op’s Hagley Road store today. We owe so much to all keyworkers who worked so hard during the pandemic and beyond to keep us safe and healthy. They’ve worked hard to keep our shops open, our shelves stocked, and vital food and supplies available to us all. Shopworkers were those who were on the frontline and deserve our respect.  </p>
<p>“But beyond that, abusing those that are trying to help us should never be tolerated. Despite that, already unacceptably high levels of violence towards them have skyrocketed. Too often this behaviour occurs around the enforcement of statutory age restrictions, such as asking people for identification when buying alcohol. </p>
<p>“It’s absolutely vital that as retail workers enforce the laws that we in Parliament set for them, we also ensure they have the proper protection they need to do so. I will continue to fight on their behalf for greater protection for those working in retail.” </p>
<p>Phil Senior, Co-op’s Area Manager, added: “Shopworkers work at the heart of communities and played an amazing role, especially throughout the pandemic, and so we are delighted that Preet Kaur Gill MP was able to meet and talk to frontline colleagues. While the majority of customers are fantastic, and really value the role their local store plays in the community, the abuse and assaults that frontline shopworkers can face on a daily basis should not be part of the job. It is not just the physical impact on colleagues, but their mental wellbeing too. We have had colleagues pushed, shoved, spat at and threatened with knives. Shopworkers should be able to carry out their role in local community life free from fear.” </p>
<p>Co-op has invested over £140m in the latest technology to keep colleagues safe over the past five years and continues to do all it can to protect colleagues, including introducing the latest in remote monitored CCTV and, body-worn cameras that can send real time audio and visual footage to its security operations centre at the touch of a button. </p>

<p><em>My latest editorial for the Telegraph &amp; Argus, appearing in Wednesday 17th November&#8217;s edition</em></p>



<p>Just over a week ago, I attended the House of Commons to ask the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees Mogg MP, to grant a debate with a focus on funding and access to NHS dentistry. However, before I could ask this, the Leader of the House dropped the bombshell that the Prime Minister was to make a U-turn on his plans for a Tory-dominated committee to rewrite the House of Commons&nbsp;rules on standards.</p>



<p>Only the day before, I witnessed Government whips corralling Tory MPs through the voting lobbies to prevent a former Conservative Minister from being suspended from Parliament for lobbying on behalf of two firms he was working for.</p>



<p>In the words of John Major, former Conservative Prime Minister, “I think the way the government handled that was shameful, wrong and unworthy of this or indeed any government. It also had the effect of trashing the reputation of parliament.”</p>



<p>Throughout this parliament, I have seen first-hand how this government has put the political considerations of their MPs and friends above the needs of the general population, non-more so than throughout their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Whilst the Tories may want us to think that Tory sleaze is old news, it’s clearly still alive and kicking for us all to see. It’s disappointing to see the government of the day treating my constituents in Bradford South, and others across the country, with such contempt. Seemingly, it’s one rule for them and their mates and another for the rest of us.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, I was also disappointed by the government’s response to questions raised in my speech on the Budget. I again asked the Chancellor about his plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) and connectivity to and across the North. I have raised this question many times in Westminster and elsewhere, maybe as many times as the government&nbsp;has&nbsp;made announcements on it, but it would be hard going to match their record as they have made at least 60 but with extraordinarily little substance.</p>



<p>In the avalanche of leaks from the Treasury, I was hoping to hear some positive messages on NPR but sadly nothing was forthcoming. I then hoped the Chancellor would pull something out of the hat on Budget Day. He did no such thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know if the government had some positive news on NPR for Bradford, it would not be keeping it a secret. I am now hearing that the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) is likely to be published tomorrow.</p>



<p>The integrated rail plan was supposed to be about presenting a blueprint of how Northern Powerhouse Rail, HS2 and Trans-Pennine upgrades &#8211; three separate but integrated schemes &#8211; would be delivered in parallel. &nbsp;Delivered in full, this could have provided up to 150,000 new jobs, halved journey times from Bradford to Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and York, and boosted Bradford’s economy by £30 billion over ten years. Instead, it looks like we will get a failure to deliver NPR, a watered-down HS2 and money to deliver Trans-Pennine route upgrades that are needed anyway. &nbsp;This diluted version will not deliver the transformational change the North needs.</p>



<p>Lots of people right across the north voted Conservative for the first time at the last election, believing promises about levelling-up and investment in the North. Delivering NPR was one of the first things Mr Johnson promised on becoming PM.</p>



<p>I, for one, will not be doffing my cap and thanking him for short-changing Bradford and the North again – nor would my constituents forgive me if I took this easy course of action.</p>



<p><strong>Returning to the rest of the Budget, alongside the Chancellor’s failure to promote economic growth in the North, he also failed to</strong> tackle the growing cost of living crisis and continued to place a massive tax burden on working people and businesses.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was an out-of-touch, high tax, low growth budget from an out-of-touch chancellor.</p>



<p>On a brighter note, the Menopause Bill, which I have been working on, moved another step closer to being enacted this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, it costs women hundreds of pounds every year to access hormone replacement therapy. This legislation&nbsp;will see these costs drastically reduced and as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on osteoporosis and bone health, this is something I wholeheartedly support.</p>



<p>Women need to be properly supported around the time of menopause and this includes assessing their risk of osteoporosis and fractures, being given appropriate advice and any medication and treatment that they may need.</p>



<p>I am proud to both break the silence on the silent disease of osteoporosis and to break the taboo on talking about menopause.</p>

<p>“Enough is enough,” said local MP Nia Griffith as she
joined shopworkers and their USDAW trade union reps in Llanelli’s Tesco store
for Respect for Shopworkers week (15- 21 November) to highlight the
growing problem of violence against shopworkers</p>



<p>&nbsp;Nia Griffith MP
explained:</p>



<p>“Bad behaviour towards shopworkers is not a new
phenomenon, but it has reached epidemic proportions since the start of lockdown
in March 2020. </p>



<p>I know that the overwhelming majority of people agree
that there is no excuse for anyone taking out their frustration on shopworkers,
but the fact of the matter is 9 out of 10 shopworkers have experienced verbal
abuse, with 1 in 10 actually being physically abused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Behind these shocking statistics are real people. Mams
and dads, sons and daughters, who are just doing their job and should not have
to face any kind of abuse when doing so.</p>



<p>To tackle the problem, I really want to see the wording
of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently going
through parliament, spell out that it is a specific offence to assault a
shopworker, and make it more straightforward to prosecute and punish people who
behave in this disgraceful way. Together with my Labour colleagues, I will be
supporting this, but to get through Parliament, we need the Prime Minister and
his Tory MPs to do likewise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I’m pleased to support USDAW&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/gosgCXL8Eiw44LQF6q6C8?domain=usdaw.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freedom From Fear Campaign</a>&nbsp;and why we must do absolutely
everything in our power to protect shopworkers and to instil respect for the
work that they do – especially during Covid-19.”</p>

<p>At full council yesterday
afternoon, Cllr Longford was asked what she would like to see from COP26 this
week and what progress Nottingham has made on its carbon neutral ambition. The
question came from Mike Edwards, Councillor for the Meadows. </p>



<p>In response Cllr Sally
Longford said “I think we would all agree that the desired outcome for COP
would be that agreement is reached to work together internationally to, secure
global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach. But we also
need to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats, and to mobilise
finance, particularly for communities at the greatest threat from the effects
of climate change.”<br>
<br>
Cllr Sally Longford will be attending COP26 this week as part of the Core
Cities delegation, to showcase Nottingham’s response to the climate emergency
and learn from cities around the world about what more we can do. </p>



<p>Cllr
Longford also updated Full Council on significant progress in Nottingham toward
its 2028 carbon neutral goal:</p>



<ul><li>City CO2
emissions have reduced by 53% per capita since 2005, the most of any UK core
city and</li><li>45% of the
Council fleet is now ULEV. </li><li>First in world to
use purpose built electric bin wagons and over </li><li>14,500 trees have
been planted since 2019 with 50,000 by 2023. </li><li>130 public EV
charging points, with an additional </li><li>81 recently
installed at new Broadmarsh Car Park.</li><li>Since 2012, over
7,000 social and private hard-to-heat homes have been insulated and over 4,000
social housing properties now have solar panels.</li></ul>



<p>“However I am far from
complacent, there is much to do and we cannot do this on our own.” insisted
Cllr Sally Longford.<br>
<br>
“We need Government, private investment and other stakeholders to support our
vital work. We have already had demonstrator projects in the city, but they
need to be scaled up, creating jobs and achieving a just transition to a low
carbon economy, where our more deprived communities can benefit from warmer
homes, affordable energy and access to clean modes of transport.”</p>



<p>Last Saturday worldwide
marches took place to demand international action on climate change. Cllr
Longford attended, and spoke at, the event.</p>



<p>“I was honoured to be given
the opportunity to lead the march alongside Lilian Greenwood, with a diverse
group of people, on Saturday to stand up for Climate Justice and to speak at
the rally in the Old Market Square.”</p>



<p>Councillor Longford wrapped
up her answer by stating “We need the Government to take action, and truly
commit to a net zero-carbon future.” </p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

            <div class="panel-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>More than 10 million people across the UK &#8211; including 1,552,387 across the Midlands &#8211; have now received a COVID-19 booster or third jab to protect themselves and their loved ones this winter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Matt Warman is calling for vulnerable people in Boston &amp; Skegness who have not yet come forward to do so as soon as possible to help build our wall of defence and keep people safe over the winter months.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is making it easier than ever to get topped-up by allowing people to book their appointments five months after their second dose from Monday and making booster jabs available at walk-in centres without appointments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that 1,552,387 people in the Midlands have received their COVID-19 booster or third jab as the Conservative government continues to step up efforts to ensure that vulnerable people are fully protected against COVID-19 over the winter.</p>
<p>The latest figures show that more than 10 million people across the UK have received their COVID-19 booster or third jabs, ensuring the vital protection they have secured from their first two doses is maintained over the winter months.</p>
<p>A total of 10,062,704 people have received their booster and third jabs in the UK. 45,836,791 people have had two doses (79.7%) and 50,234,416 people have received one dose (87.4%).</p>
<p>Seven in 10 over 80s and three in five over-50s in England are already vaccinated with top-up jabs.</p>
<p>NHS England will be inviting another three million people who will become eligible for their booster next week. More than 13 million invites, including texts, letters and emails, have already been sent to eligible people in England so far asking them to book their booster online through the National Booking Service. The additional letters due to land next week will mean around 16 million invites have been sent in England since the NHS booster programme began.</p>
<p>The National Booking Service will be updated tomorrow (Monday 8 November) to allow those eligible for a booster vaccine &#8211; people over 50 and those most at risk of COVID-19 &#8211; to pre-book their jab five months after their second dose.</p>
<p>People will still receive their vaccine six months after their second dose, but the change will speed up the vaccination programme by allowing people to receive a jab the day they become eligible, rather than waiting for a convenient appointment.</p>
<p>People will also be able to book by calling 119 and can get vaccinated at hundreds of walk-in sites across the country six months after their second dose without an appointment. Those eligible can use the NHS online walk-in finder to locate the most convenient site.</p>
<p>COVID-19 booster vaccines have been delivered or booked in at every older adult care home in England where safe to do so, with almost nine in 10 care homes already visited.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“It is absolutely fantastic news that 1,552,387 people across the Midlands have received a booster dose or third vaccination, which will offer life-saving protection to them and their loved ones this winter.</p>
<p>“Those people, including everyone who has got their third jab in Boston &amp; Skegness, are part of the ten million people across the country who have already received a booster jab. I would urge anyone who is eligible and hasn’t yet come forward to get a booster jab as soon as possible, by booking online or at one of our local walk-in sites.</p>
<p>We can all do our bit this winter to protect our loved ones and the NHS, and to stay ahead in the race against the virus, by taking up the offer of a vaccine as soon as we are eligible.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“More than 10 million people across the UK now have the vital protection boosters provide, building our wall of defence and keeping people safe over the winter months. We know immunity begins to wane after six months, particularly for the elderly and at-risk groups, and booster jabs will ensure our most vulnerable are protected over the winter.</p>
<p>“It’s never been easier to get your top-up jabs now that those eligible can book in advance or visit hundreds of walk-in sites across the country.</p>
<p>“Please do not delay &#8211; get your vaccines as soon as you can to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter so we can keep the virus at bay.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes to Editors:</strong></p>
<p>The Conservative government is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling out the fastest vaccine programme in Europe, allowing us to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms.</strong> Almost nine in ten people aged 12 and over have now received a first vaccine dose – with almost eight in ten having also received a second dose. The latest data shows that vaccines have saved almost 130,000 deaths and prevented almost 250,000 hospitalisations. <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/"> Public Health England, Coronavirus Dashboard, accessed 21October 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Securing two new ground-breaking Covid antiviral drugs, preventing the spread of the virus and bolstering our defence for the winter months ahead.</strong> We have secured 730,000 doses of two new ground-breaking antiviral drugs – which will help to prevent the infection from spreading and speed up recovery times for people. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-secures-groundbreaking-covid-19-antivirals">DHSC, Press Release, 20 October 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Securing a portfolio of 517 million doses of the eight most promising vaccines through our Vaccine Taskforce for the whole of the Union.</strong> We have secured a portfolio of 517 million doses of the most promising vaccines, including over 210 million doses of the Oxford-Astrazenca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines being administered across the UK, as well as 20 million doses of the Janssen vaccine which be rolled out later this year. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/janssen-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-by-uk-medicines-regulator">DHSC, Press Release, 28 May 2021</a>; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-thirds-of-uk-adults-receive-first-dose-of-a-covid-19-vaccine">DHSC, Press Release, 7 May 2021</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting the NHS on a sustainable financial footing, so it is there for future generations.</strong> We will deliver around £12 billion a year in extra funding for our frontline health and social care across the UK over the next three years – a total of £36 billion. This is in addition to our historic settlement for the NHS in 2018, which will see its budget rise by £33.9 billion a year by 2023-24. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015736/Build_Back_Better-_Our_Plan_for_Health_and_Social_Care.pdf">Prime Minister’s Office, Build Back Better: Our Plan for Health and Social Care, 7 September 2021</a></li>
<li><strong>Delivering the biggest catch-up programme in the NHS’s history, so that everyone can get the care they deserve.</strong> Over the next three years, will deliver the equivalent of around nine million more checks, scans and procedures – and elective activity will be around 30 per cent than it was before the pandemic. Once the NHS has recovered from the pandemic, activity should be ten per cent higher than under the NHS Long Term Plan. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015736/Build_Back_Better-_Our_Plan_for_Health_and_Social_Care.pdf">Prime Minister’s Office, Build Back Better: Our Plan for Health and Social Care, 7 September 2021</a></li>

			<p>I have spoken out against the Government’s plans to pass a new bill to reorganise the NHS in England.</p>
<p>As a long-time campaigner against NHS privatisation, previously resigning as Chair of Rochdale Primary Care Trust over concerns of the increase in use of private healthcare companies in the NHS, I am speaking out this time against the Government’s Health and Care Bill.</p>
<p>The action comes as a new poll by We Own It, the campaign for public ownership of public services, shows that 8 in 10 people want the Government to fix waiting lists and ensure that people can see their GPs face-to-face as their top priority, compared to just 2 in 10 who said reorganising the NHS should be a top priority.</p>
<p>The Bill, which had its second reading in the House of Commons on 14 July, is expected to enter the next stage of its passage on 9 November. The Bill will divide the NHS in England into 42 areas, called Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), each with its own budget and a board to oversee the delivery of health services for the area.</p>
<p>This is the wrong bill at the wrong time.</p>
<p>To introduce a bill like this when the Covid pandemic is far from over, and staff are on their knees, shows a lack of understanding of what’s needed. I’m also concerned that this re-organisation of the NHS is being used as an opportunity to extend the involvement of UK and international private healthcare companies.</p>
<p>The bill is proposing that private healthcare companies can become members of integrated care boards (ICBs) potentially procuring health services from their own companies, and this is entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Campaigners and trade unionists say the Bill will allow private companies to sit on the boards that oversee the new ICSs and make decisions about how the budget is spent. They also claim that by repealing Section 75 of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which required that all contracts be put through a competitive tendering process, the Bill will open the NHS to more crony contracts.</p>
<p>The new poll also shows that 70% of the public, including 70% of Conservative voters and 82% of Labour voters, say they are worried that the Bill would open the NHS to contracts being given out to private companies without scrutiny. 60% of those polled say they want the Bill to be amended to make NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts the default providers of all NHS services.</p>
<p>The Westminster protest was joined by more than 35 Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and SNP Members of Parliament. Organisers say further local actions are planned to take place in more than 100 constituencies, with local people dropping off letters to their MP’s offices asking them to oppose the Health and Care bill.</p>
<p>The protest was organised by We Own It and Just Treatment, a patient-led group that represents the voice of patients. It was also supported by Unite the Union, the British Medical Association, the National Pensioners Convention, and more.</p>
<p>Johnbosco Nwogbo, Campaigns Lead for We Own It, one of the key organisations involved in the action said: “This Bill will put on steroids the government&#8217;s unlawful contracting we&#8217;ve seen during the pandemic. With the Secretary of State for Health set to receive increased powers in this bill, Sajid Javid will be enabled to simply hand out contracts to party donors and friends without any kind of scrutiny”.</p>
<p>He added, “It’s clear that a lot of MPs are really worried about how this bill will change our NHS and open it to being used as a profit-making venture for profit-greedy private companies within it. We just hope more of them, including Conservatives, will speak out.”</p>
<p>Hope Worsdale, Digital Comms and Campaign Lead from Just Treatment, said: &#8220;All the patients we work with are deeply worried about the future of our NHS, so this week we took the fight against this dangerous Bill to right outside Parliament, and it was fantastic to be joined by so many MPs. This parliamentary support shows that our campaigning is working, and that we have people in the House of Commons willing to fight for the future of our NHS. We know that the government&#8217;s plans will fail patients across the country &#8211; so now we need even more people to get involved in ramping up the pressure on their MPs to reject the bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Covid and other local issues. If you are receiving one of these emails for the first time, it is because you have contacted me recently. I have been sending these updates throughout the pandemic to help provide information to people about what is going on locally. If you do not want to be included in further updates about the pandemic and other issues, please use the unsubscribe button at the bottom of this message.</p>
<h3><strong>Booster dose of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine</strong></h3>
<p>A number of people have contacted me to say that they have been unable to organise booster jabs when they thought they should be receiving them. I have checked this and the trigger point for eligibility comes six months and one week after the second vaccine jab earlier in the year. So anyone who had their jab on May 1st would be able to get their jab from next week.</p>
<p>If you are eligible but have not yet received an invitation to book from the NHS, please use <a href="https://news.chrisgrayling-mp.org.uk/4F6F6E5283BF934361A94E3CEA6B1685D0D29CAE573DBB1E3486A2A25B4F9FB9/5D97560853D6236792D3116494E87D84/LE35"><strong>this link</strong></a> to do so.</p>
<h3><strong>Face-to-face GP appointments</strong></h3>
<p>Many people have also contacted me about the availability of face to face appointments with local GPs. I know that this has been a frustration for many people. But I should also say that both GPs and the NHS have been under enormous pressure in recent months and the level of demand for appointments of all sorts has been very high indeed.</p>
<p>For many people a virtual appointment is a much easier way to deal with a GP. But I have spoken to the leadership of the NHS in Surrey and they have told me that anyone who needs a face to face appointment should be able to get one.</p>
<h3><strong>Train services to London</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you who are commuters, I am stepping up pressure on the train companies and the Department for Transport to get back to a much closer to normal timetable. The Tattenham Corner direct trains have now been restored, and I have been promised that there will be a regular through service from Ashtead and Epsom to London Bridge in the peak by next May at the latest, though I am pushing for this to be earlier.</p>
<p>There remains a serious issue around the SWR services to Waterloo and I have asked for a further meeting with the company about what is happening. If you find yourself on a train which is very overcrowded and people are struggling to get on as it gets closer to central London, it would be very helpful if you could let me know.</p>
<h3><strong>The Chalk Pit Site Epsom</strong></h3>
<p>The controversial planning application for the Chalk Pit in Epsom is due to be heard by the County Council on the 17th November. I have also met the Secretary of State to discuss the performance of the Environment Agency on the issue, and there is now an investigation taking place to see whether they have taken sufficient action on the blight to local residents.</p>
<p>I will continue to do what I can to get the issue resolved.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooding issues in Nork &amp; Tattenhams</strong></h3>
<p>Last Thursday I was at a meeting with councillors and local residents in Nork and Tattenhams and Surrey County Council about the flooding issue in the area. If you were not able to be there and your home is affected by the problem, please do<strong> <a href="mailto:chris.grayling.mp@parliament.uk">get in touch</a> </strong>and I will update you about the potential ways forward that were discussed.Future Mole Valley Local Plan</p>
<h3><strong>Mole Valley Local Plan</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you in Ashtead, the deadline to comment on the Mole Valley local plan is this coming weekend. I know that many people are very concerned about the scale of what is proposed by the Council for the area around Ashtead. If you want to comment, the link is <a href="https://news.chrisgrayling-mp.org.uk/87667194E53429415FEB1B971292AA929B66B9C20B22D6D0E3A2D094918BEBA1/5D97560853D6236792D3116494E87D84/LE35"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Government is all about making choices.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">In his budget, the UK Chancellor had the opportunity to do the decent thing for millions of people affected by the combination of rising costs and income that fails to match it. He chose not to.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that inflation and higher taxes would dwarf any small increases for middle-wage earners and that low-income households will feel &#8220;real pain&#8221;.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">They pointed out that families struggling on Universal Credit must endure a £20 per week and that the Chancellor&#8217;s adjustments won&#8217;t make up for that cut, even before national insurance rises come in the Spring. Another organisation, initially set up by the UK Government to monitor spending, said that the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years. Inflation is set to soar over 4% &#8211; that has a massive effect on the ability of households to meet their living costs.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Here in the Highlands, we have the extra challenges of having higher transport costs and higher costs for energy and fuel.  In households across our communities, people no longer have to choose between food and heat – because thanks to this Chancellor and this UK Government,  they cannot afford to buy either.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">In the spending review, the Chancellor chose not to invest in children who have the most difficult starts in life. He chose not to invest in sorting the mess created by Brexit – felt in every household in Scotland and across the nations of the UK. Instead, he chose to give a tax cut to his old pals in the city.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">It seems there is no money to invest in tackling the fact that the UK has the worst poverty levels in western Europe. Still, there was money for encouraging more short-haul air travel &#8211; on the eve of the COP 26 Climate conference. There is also money for cutting tax on ships that will fly the British flag and multinational companies, like Amazon.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">And, whilst any money for our region is welcome, let&#8217;s not fall for the small pockets of money earmarked for Highland projects. The money offered up is nothing compared to the EU money lost to the region, and it does not even come close to the £83 million still missing from the City Region Deal.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">A Tory Chancellor at Westminster made his choices. Like every other Tory budget or spending review that came before – he made them for ideological reasons. To them, if anyone is poor, that&#8217;s their hard luck – they just have to try harder.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">The fact is, those who are the poorest today have spent most of their lives governed by people who have no concept about what it is like to live without privilege. There is always money for contracts for pals, never for hard-pressed families. History shows us that the choices Westminster makes for us are never going to change. We need different choices to be made, to see fairness, justice, and hope for a better future.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Scotland will thrive without Westminster, but how long can we survive being shackled to it?</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my October email newsletter. It has been a busy but sombre month in parliament, as the Spending Review has been&nbsp;published in full and we celebrate the life, and mourn the death, of James Brokenshire MP and Sir David Amess MP.</p>



<p>Below you’ll find updates on the Budget, local Covid-19 case rates, a new charity in Langley Mill, more support for local pubs, an explanation on proposed&nbsp;amendments to the Environment Bill, and my view on a mayor for the East Midlands.</p>



<p><strong><u>Autumn Budget &amp; Spending Review</u></strong></p>



<p>On Wednesday 27th October, the Chancellor released the Autumn Budget and Spending Review, revealing the Government’s plans for spending, taxes, and borrowing. Prior to its release, I expected to see some pretty alarming public finances as a result of the pandemic, and to be fair, we have seen some difficult&nbsp;numbers. The deficits for the last financial year and the current year total £500 billion, and we will still be running a deficit this year of about £130 billion.</p>



<p>However, despite the storm of the pandemic crashing over our economy, it is forecasted that the books will be completely balanced in the financial year after next. I could not possibly have expected that we could go from the economic tempest that was the pandemic, back to balanced public finances in less than a couple of years. This is a tremendous achievement. That we can even forecast that position demonstrates how successful the Government’s measures to save the economy have been over the past 18 months.</p>



<p>The success of these forecasts depends largely upon the growth of our economy. At the minute, the UK economy is growing faster than our major international competitors, more people are in work, and growth is up. However, uncertainty in the global economy means that this rate of recovery is not guaranteed. Therefore, we need to focus on what more we can do to increase the long-term trend in the rate of growth. That is why we need to make sure that the very welcome measures to increase investment, improve skills, and boost productivity are driven through and made to work.</p>



<p>Policies of particular interest to the residents of Amber Valley include:</p>



<p>. More money for local NHS services and schools;</p>



<p>. Increasing the National Living Wage by 6.6% to £9.50;&nbsp;</p>



<p>. The end of the public sector pay freeze;</p>



<p>. A 5% cut to pub beer duty through a new Draught Relief, simplifying wider alcohol duties and freezing fuel duty;</p>



<p>. Cutting business rates by at least 50% next year for 90% of retail, hospitality and leisure businesses;&nbsp;</p>



<p>. A reduction in the universal credit taper from the current 63p to 55p &#8211; allowing claimants who are in work to keep more of their benefits, ensuring that being in work pays more.</p>



<p>Speaking in the House of Commons on 27th October, I wholeheartedly welcomed the Autumn Budget and Spending Review. I believe it to be a hugely powerful budget that sets our country and economy in the right direction. It shows a welcome improvement in the public finances and delivers on many of the priorities of Amber Valley residents.</p>



<p>You can find the Chancellor&#8217;s statement in full <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents">here</a>, and my speech in the House following it <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-27a.288.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g340.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Covid-19 and Vaccination Update</u></strong></p>



<p>558 Positive cases have been confirmed in Amber Valley over the last 7 days, that’s 433 cases per 100,000 people. This remains below the national average for England, which currently stands at 484 cases per 100,000 people.o</p>



<p>The number of people testing positive for coronavirus in Amber Valley has been fluctuating since restrictions in England were lifted on 19<sup>th</sup> July, and as predicted, case rates began to increase considerably as we moved through autumn into the colder months. This led to some of the highest case rates we have seen in our constituency, with 157 people testing positive on the 4<sup>th</sup> October. However, despite some projections that case rates would continue to rise, they have actually been falling consistently throughout this month, so that the 7 day average for positive cases currently sits at 79.</p>



<p>Compared to last winter, hospitalisations relating to coronavirus continue to remain well below what we would expect, given the relatively high prevalence of the virus in the community. It is clear for the time being, that while health services in Amber Valley remain under some strain, owing in no small part to the unprecedented backlog in treatments, the risk of it being overwhelmed remains low. It is for this reason, therefore, that I do not support the introduction of so-called “plan-b” coronavirus restrictions at this time.</p>



<p>Our first line of defence against this virus continues to be our exemplary vaccination rollout, a terrific local and national effort. With everyone over the age of 50 being offered a booster jab, I urge anyone who is eligible to come forward and get jabbed. To protect themselves, our community, and our local health services.</p>



<p>As with the first doses of the vaccine, when you are eligible you should be notified by text, letter, or by your GP to arrange a booking. However, if you think you are eligible but have not been notified you can book the booster by calling 119 or online via the NHS website: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/book-or-manage-a-booster-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/book-or-manage-a-booster-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/</a></p>



<p><strong><u>Breast Milk Hub opening &#8211; Langley Mill</u></strong></p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was honoured to open Lauren’s Milk Hub in Langley Mill. This new Hub will help provide donor human breast milk that can then be transported to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) at hospitals across the East Midlands. It is an excellent addition to our local health networks as it will allow more sick and premature babies in the region to receive safe, screened donor milk.</p>



<p><strong><u>Support for Local Pubs</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 20<sup>th</sup> October I met with Emma McClarkin, Head of the British Beer and Pub Association, to sign a petition calling on the Government to lower draught beer duty ahead of the autumn budget. I am delighted that upon release of the budget, the Chancellor announced that tax on draught beer and cider will indeed be cut by 5%. The duty cut will bring down the cost of a pint by 3p, or as much as 25p for beer below 3.5% ABV.</p>



<p>The local pub is at the heart of many of our communities in Amber Valley, and is vital for creating jobs, boosting the local economy, and combatting loneliness and social isolation. In our constituency alone, pubs support 1,103 jobs and contribute £25m per year to the local economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an especially difficult time for pubs, and local owners and staff have made clear to me how precarious the past 2 years have been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, I am very pleased that the Government has continued to demonstrate its firm commitment to this most vital industry. With the lower duty on draught beer set to help our locals in Amber Valley thrive.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have recently been in contact with me to raise concerns about access to GP appointments following the pandemic. I&#8217;m very grateful for the work of our GPs, and all our NHS, throughout Covid-19 and always, and so I raised this issue in the House with the Secretary of State during Health &amp; Social Care Questions to see how we can support both GPs and constituents. I welcome the recent announcement of a £250 million winter access fund for GPs as a positive step, and I will continue to follow this closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read the full debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-10-19c.585.3&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g586.2">here</a>&nbsp;and the full GP plan <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/10/plan-set-out-to-improve-access-for-nhs-patients-and-support-gps/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Investment in the East Midlands</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament on the 26<sup>th</sup> of this month, I urged the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, to make progress on devolution and additional investment in the&nbsp;East Midlands. Our region has looked with some deserved envy at neighbouring regions that have elected mayors and have successfully attracted more investment.</p>



<p>It is my firm belief that the East Midlands would benefit greatly from an elected mayor to represent the region on the national stage. However, in the meantime I also reminded the Secretary of State that Derbyshire stands ready for a county deal of investment and would appreciate being a pathfinder for this scheme.

              <h2><a href="http://wendymorton.co.uk/the-budget-2021/">The Budget 2021</a></h2>
              <h3>Wendy Morton (Aldridge-Brownhills)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out on behalf of the Government a budget that seeks to look to a more optimistic future as we move beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst we have endured challenging times, the budget prepares a new economy with higher wages, higher skills and rising productivity which will deliver for all the residents of Aldridge-Brownhills.</p>
<p>Our ability to be able to successfully fight the Covid-19 pandemic was due to the enormous effort of our precious National Health Service. It was therefore extremely welcome news that there would be further investment in our NHS with a commitment to 40 new hospitals and the recruitment of 50,000 new nurses.</p>
<p>The budget once again reaffirmed our commitment to hard working families with a 6.6% increase in the National Living Wage equivalent of £1,000, and a tax cut for families on Universal Credit putting more money back in their pockets. Recognising the squeeze that so many families are feeling due to the increase in fuel prices the Chancellor scrapped the anticipated rise in fuel duty, saving families’ money at the pumps will be welcomed.</p>
<p>The Government’s priority as we move beyond the global pandemic is an ambitious programme of frontline investment to level up right across our country to close the gap between London and regions like ours. As independent commentators have observed our economy is fundamentally strong and whilst Covid-19 has had an impact on our economy, the Government stands on the side of families and businesses to support our precious public services and business community.</p>
<p>Public services are the People’s Priorities and at the heart of the budget was support for young people with an investment of over £500 million in youth services, 30,000 new school places for Special Educational Needs, a further £3 billion to help all pupils as part of the Covid-19 education recovery fund and a £4.7 billion of funding for education meaning per pupil funding will rise on average to £1,500 per pupil.</p>
<p>With sustained investment to deliver on key infrastructure projects, research and development and a commitment to greater productivity across the economy we will deliver on our ambition for Britain to be a global leader. With record investment in new transport projects the West Midlands Mayor Andy Street will receive more than £1billion for new transportation projects across our region to help level up our local areas and extend our economic reach. At the same time the new funding also represents a major step forward to realise my long held ambition to reopen a railway station in Aldridge.</p>
<p>A commitment to build 180,000 new affordable new homes with a £1.8 billion investment in brownfield development means we will get the homes we need in the right places. It will also mean that we can protect our precious Green Belt and truly live up to our ambition of a ‘Brownfield First’ approach to development.</p>
<p>This additional funding will be extremely important to all of us in Aldridge-Brownhills as we continue to work with Mayor Andy Street to stop speculative and unsuitable development on our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces.</p>
<p>Supporting businesses and High Streets is a key part of our economic recovery and I was pleased the Chancellor announced the long awaited review of Business Rates. I was also pleased that next year’s planned increases in Business Rates have been halted and that our Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Sector will receive a 50% discount, helping our High Streets and Village Centres through challenging times.</p>
<p>As a Government we are focussed on ensuring that we have Higher Skills, Higher Productivity and Higher Wages focussing on the ‘People’s Priorities’. The Budget represents our commitment to level up right across the whole United Kingdom delivering on our promises to the British people and all of the hard working families of Aldridge-Brownhills.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps visits Arla distribution centre, where 1/10 of all milk sold in the UK travels through.</strong></p>
<p>It was a chilly constituency Friday for Mr Shapps, as he was invited to tour the 235,000 square foot refrigerated distribution facility, which sees 520 million litres of fresh milk pass through it each year.</p>
<p>Opened in 2013, the facility operates 24/7, 364 days a year, delivering brands such as Cravendale to stores around the country, to retailers like Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s. The centre employs a team of 500 people, 60% of which are Welwyn Hatfield residents.</p>
<p>Prior to the tour of the distribution centre, Mr Shapps sat down with Ash Amirahmadi- Managing Director of Arla Foods UK- and other members of the local team to discuss the challenges and pressures facing the company, and food distribution more widely, during the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>At the centre of discussions was the HGV driver shortage. At Arla, HGV salaries have been going up to meet demand for drivers- with annual salaries of £50,000-£70,000 depending on shift pattern.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of Arla Foods said: “We were delighted to welcome Grant Shapps to Arla Hatfield. We had a very constructive and positive discussion about our cooperative and the wider dairy sector with him, both as our local MP and as the Transport Secretary. We look forward to continuing to work closely together in the future.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s been really great to come to Arla, and hear first hand how businesses with a presence in my own constituency have been reacting to the international HGV driver shortage, as well as how the company has adapted to doing business post-covid.</p>
<p>“I commend Arla for their commitment to improving pay and conditions for HGV drivers. Increases in pay, starting a driving academy to train new drivers, as well as a programme to rehabilitate former prisoners to drive lorries and improvements to their facilities- all of these things will help make driving an HGV a more attractive career choice for those looking to get into the industry. Our plan seems to be working, with 1,000 provisional HGV licenses being applied for each day- that’s 3 times higher than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As Transport Secretary, I’ve put together a list of 25 separate measures to help ease the pressure on businesses like Arla- including increasing driving test capacity at the DVSA to clear the covid backlog, making those tests faster by stream-lining them and getting the army in to take on some of the strain in the short-term.</p>
<p>“These measures, combined with the hard work of the food distributors I’ve met today, will keep our supplies stocked as the global economy gets back up and running.”</p></div>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
