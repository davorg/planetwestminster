            <div class="panel-body">
<p>The UK government needs to borrow a lot of money to cover what it spends in excess of what it gets from taxes. It pays different interest rates on its borrowing depending on how long it wants to borrow for. Money borrowed for a few months is borrowed at around the Bank rate the Bank of England fixes and publishes, currently 4.5%. To borrow for say ten years the government sells ten year bonds to people, pension funds and insurance companies that hold our savings. These bonds take the money off us for the government to spend. The government promises to repay it in ten years time, offering the lender/saver an guaranteed annual rate of interest. This is currently at 4.3%.</p>
<p>The Bank of England has huge influence over how much the government has to pay in interest. By setting a higher Bank rate it usually drags the longer rates upwards. It can say it wants rates to go higher and that will often send them up. It owns a large quantity of the government bonds which it bought up at very high prices in recent years. It can sell some of these to drive the price of the government bond down which pushes up the interest rate.</p>
<p>By way of simple example if the  Bank owned a 1% government bond with no repayment date the bond would trade at £100 per £100 issued paying £1 in interest every year to holders all the time the Bank wanted long rates at 1%. If the Bank wanted to put long rates up to 2% the value of all those bonds would halve to £50 per £100 saved, so the £1 of interest gave the new buyer 2% on the £50 they spent to buy it from the original holder. The losses are lower the shorter the time to repayment of the bond. A 1% 1 year  £100 bond would fall by £1 in value to £99  if rates doubled to 2%, so the new buyer would earn the £1 of interest over the year and would be paid back £100 for the £99 he had paid for the bond, giving £1 of gain making £2 in total return.</p>
<p>In 2021 when the Bank of England was wanting to boost inflation and the economy it bought up huge quantities of bonds to keep all rates very low. It allowed the government to borrow ten year money for just 0.2%. Now today it panics about the inflation it has helped create. Last autumn it decided to drive bonds down greatly by announcing a huge sales programme of £80bn a year of sales of bonds just before the mini budget and said it wanted bonds down and rates up. Rate soared to over 4% from the lows of the previous year. The sell off was exaggerated by some   geared pension funds having to sell to raise money to pay for bonds they had bought without the money to pay for them in full.  In recent days prior to the publication of disappointing inflation figures the Bank again said it wanted rates up and was thinking of selling or cancelling more bonds next year following a review. Bonds were falling as a result before the inflation figures which added to the woes of the market. Bonds are back to similar levels to last autumn. There was no extra selling pressure from overcommitted pension funds this time round.</p>
<p>This should worry the Treasury and Bank. This will make it more difficult to pay for government spending going forward and makes a recession more likely. A recession will increase the deficit, the amount government needs to borrow by depressing tax revenues and hiking spending on the unemployed.</p>
<p>Selling the bonds at large losses is what they call Quantitative tightening. The Bank told Parliament it would have little impact on inflation and they were doing it just to reduce the size of their balance sheet as a technical exercise. I think they are wrong about all of that. I think big sales at losses destabilise markets and raise interest rates more than needed. If they are right and these sales are unimportant to their policy why not suspend them to ease market nerves? Holding the bonds until they mature will still bring down the size of the balance sheet in due course and it will spare taxpayers some of the large losses currently running at £12bn a year.</p>

This funding aims to enhance local skills training and support the employment prospects of individuals within their communities.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A total of £165 million will be distributed across various regions, enabling them to improve their skills training initiatives. The funds will be used to upgrade facilities with modern equipment, enhance the skills of teachers, and introduce new courses in essential subjects.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The additional funding will be directed towards courses focused on green construction, carbon capture, cyber security, and those aligned with the requirements of local employers. Successful applicants will be granted financial support to implement initiatives aligned with their region's Local Skills Improvement Plan, which is devised by employer bodies to ensure technical training after the age of 16 caters to local demands.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This investment will have a positive impact on local economies by enabling businesses to access the necessary skills, aligning with the Prime Minister's priority of economic growth.</span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span>“Investing in education and skills will unlock future growth, boost productivity, and help build the skilled workforce of the future in South Shropshire.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“</span></span><span><span>That is why I welcome the extra £165 million investment in skills training from the Conservative Government and encourage colleges and further education providers across the county to apply for their share to help get more people into jobs closer to home.</span></span></p>

<p>For decades now, our planning system hasn’t been delivering the housing we need, in the places we need it, for the people who need it. For too long, the system appears to have been driven by the national volume house builders who too often make their money from land banking and high density commuter housing estates on the edge of existing developments – rather than through a proper planning system run to deliver for the people who need planning to work for them, instead of being done TO them.</p>

<p>I’ve long been concerned by the amount of development coming to areas like our own in rural Mid Norfolk – which is often inappropriate, “industrial” in scale and unsustainable. While most of our villages can take and are indeed up for (when properly asked) taking some additional new housing (without which our communities will gradually fade away), I fundamentally believe that more needs to be done to give local communities a greater say in how they develop in the years to come (with greater protections), which is why I have been so vocal in my opposition to the way so many large national developers abuse and take advantage of the planning system to dump such inappropriate and unsustainable developments on our towns and villages.<br />
 <br />
That’s why, through <strong><em>The Norfolk Way</em></strong> project I set up before I became an MP, I have been so vocal in advocating for a better model of growth and development that places greater emphasis on delivering small pockets of housing of the type and aesthetic desired by local communities, and in the places they earmark. I truly believe the spirit of Localism enshrined in the 2011 Localism Act should be enhanced, with the Act itself strengthened to remove some of the loopholes we’ve seen exploited. (To read more about my views in full, please visit my ‘Planning and Protecting Our Rural Heritage and Landscape’ campaign page <a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/planning-and-protecting-our-rural-landscape-and-heritage">here</a>) I was delighted to see the NPPF reformed in the autumn by Michael Gove to give more power to local planners.</p>

<p>I continue to make the case I have long made that the right way to plan housing is to give local councils, democratically accountable to the local residents they serve, the freedoms and incentives to plan properly for the right sort of housing and growth where it is needed ie:</p>

<ul><li>around hotspots of economic growth</li>
	<li>on brownfield sites in areas needing regeneration</li>
	<li>around growth towns with the infrastructure and services available to sustain further growth</li>
	<li>in villages with a Neighbourhood Plan setting out the amount of housing they are happy/able to take and which ensures affordable & appropriate local housing for local workers and residents</li>
</ul><p>That’s what the <strong>Breckland</strong> and <strong>South Norfolk Council</strong> Local Plans rightly aim to do. What we don’t need in rural Norfolk is massive commuter estate “New Towns” dumped in the middle of rural mud Norfolk without proper infrastructure, facilities, sustainable transport links or fit with the existing pattern of development.</p>

<p><strong>The North Elmham New Town</strong></p>

<p>The North Elmham New Town would also represent massive development of the precious River Wensum chalk stream habitats (not to mention a Site of Specific Scientific Interest).</p>

<p>That’s why I was delighted to chair a meeting on Friday in North Elmham with local parish councils and local councillors Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge to make clear that the idea of a new town in the area will NOT be supported by ourselves as elected local  representatives.</p>

<p>Bill and Gordon confirmed that Breckland Council are NOT zoning this area for major housebuilding, and will oppose a re-application of the New Town as we did successfully last time it was proposed.</p></div>

While most of our villages can take and are indeed up for (when properly asked) taking some additional new housing (without which our communities will gradually fade away), I fundamentally believe that more needs to be done to give local communities a greater say in how they develop in the years to come (with greater protections), which is why I have been so vocal in my opposition to the way so many large national developers abuse and take advantage of the planning system to dump such inappropriate and unsustainable developments on our towns and villages.<br />
 <br />
That’s why, through <strong><em>The Norfolk Way</em></strong> project I set up before I became an MP, I have been so vocal in advocating for a better model of growth and development that places greater emphasis on delivering small pockets of housing of the type and aesthetic desired by local communities, and in the places they earmark. I truly believe the spirit of Localism enshrined in the 2011 Localism Act should be enhanced, with the Act itself strengthened to remove some of the loopholes we’ve seen exploited. (To read more about my views in full, please visit my ‘Planning and Protecting Our Rural Heritage and Landscape’ campaign page <a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/planning-and-protecting-our-rural-landscape-and-heritage">here</a>) I was delighted to see the NPPF reformed in the autumn by Michael Gove to give more power to local planners.</p>

<p>I continue to make the case I have long made that the right way to plan housing is to give local councils, democratically accountable to the local residents they serve, the freedoms and incentives to plan properly for the right sort of housing and growth where it is needed ie:</p>

<ul><li>around hotspots of economic growth</li>
	<li>on brownfield sites in areas needing regeneration</li>
	<li>around growth towns with the infrastructure and services available to sustain further growth</li>
	<li>in villages with a Neighbourhood Plan setting out the amount of housing they are happy/able to take and which ensures affordable & appropriate local housing for local workers and residents</li>
</ul><p>That’s what the <strong>Breckland</strong> and <strong>South Norfolk Council</strong> Local Plans rightly aim to do. What we don’t need in rural Norfolk is massive commuter estate “New Towns” dumped in the middle of rural mud Norfolk without proper infrastructure, facilities, sustainable transport links or fit with the existing pattern of development.</p>

<p><strong>The North Elmham New Town</strong></p>

<p>The North Elmham New Town would also represent massive development of the precious River Wensum chalk stream habitats (not to mention a Site of Specific Scientific Interest).</p>

<p>That’s why I was delighted to chair a meeting on Friday in North Elmham with local parish councils and local councillors Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge to make clear that the idea of a new town in the area will NOT be supported by ourselves as elected local  representatives.</p>

<p>Bill and Gordon confirmed that Breckland Council are NOT zoning this area for major housebuilding, and will oppose a re-application of the New Town as we did successfully last time it was proposed.</p></div>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

<ul><li>To reconvene a meeting of ALL the parish councils in the affected area after the forthcoming local elections on May 4th to make sure all write to Breckland Council formally to express their concerns.</li>
	<li>Bill and Gordon and I will liaise to ensure all the local residents who object have their objections properly acknowledged by BDC.</li>
	<li>I will invite my neighbouring MP, Jerome Mayhew, to join that follow-up meeting given a number of his Broadland communities are in close proximity to the site around North Elmham and would also be affected.</li>
	<li>I will write to Michael Gove (Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) and the Minister for Housing to make clear why any New Towns and Garden Villages should only be  delivered in the right locations with the associated connectivity, infrastructure and services required) and not in inappropriate locations with the obvious environmental, sustainability and transport issues this scale of development would inevitably threaten.</li>
</ul><p> Please be assured that I will keep on this in the weeks and months ahead.</p></div>

              <h3>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>This week, on the floor of the House of Commons, Westmorland MP Tim Farron has called for a radical reform of NHS dentistry.</p>
<p>Tim spoke of the desperation of patients within his constituency as they are faced with the decision to either go private or travel miles to access a dentist.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"I have recently lost a surgery in my community [in Grange-over-Sands] that saw 5,800 patients lose their NHS status overnight. The private plan that those patients were offered to replace those places would have cost a family of four £1,000 a year just to stay registered and on the books."</em></p>
<p>He offered another example of the dentistry crisis; that a family in Coniston's nearest available NHS dental practice is in Hexham, Northumberland. This would force a family to take a 160-mile round trip just to see their dentist.</p>
<p>He also warned of the potentially life-threatening consequences of patients not being able to receive regular dentistry appointments, as they are often the first to spot symptoms of oral related cancers and diseases.</p>
<p>Tim made the point that people are paying for services, via their taxes, they are not receiving. Additionally, that the money dentists receive from their patients for treatment is not enough to sustain most practices.</p>
<p>He said: <em>"A unit of dental activity payment, at the most basic level, could net perhaps £20 or £30 for a single examination. Diligent dentists seeking to do a good job might do three of those in an hour. Let us do the maths - that funding is not enough to pay to keep the lights and heating on, pay the rent and pay for salaries and materials."</em></p>
<p>He said that this has led to a situation where dentists must now effectively subsidise the NHS which does not incentivise good professional practice and is calling for reform: <em>"Unless there is radical reform of the system, good dentists will leave the NHS and thousands on thousands of our constituents will not be able to access the dental care that they have already paid for through their taxes for themselves and their children."</em></p>

<p>On Monday, I joined Keir Starmer in Braintree, as a member of the Shadow Health team, to share Labour’s vision for an NHS fit for the 21st century. This year the service will be 75 years old. If we are to secure the next 75 years, we must rethink how we provide services to people.</p>
<p>Labour’s ten-year ambition for the NHS and social care system are unashamedly ambitious. Like with the last Labour Government, we inherited an NHS that was struggling. But we turned it around that’s because we know that ambition is vital for securing healthcare for all. </p>
<p>We will bring about three fundamental reforms to make the NHS work for you.</p>
<p>1.	Change so that more people get care at home in their community.<br />
2.	Securing the workforce we need in the healthcare system, with modern technology to deliver the patient outcomes we all want.<br />
3.	Refocussing the NHS to prevention instead of cure.</p>
<p>A quick train journey to London from Braintree allowed me to join the MillionPlus parliamentary roundtable to discuss the future of nursing. Speaking at the event allowed me to share our vision and hear from those on the frontline on how we can harness best practice and look at innovative ways of training the workforce of the future.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I support the Dignity in Dying campaign to allow choice at the end of life. It was a pleasure to welcome, as Co-Chair, Prue Leith to Parliament who is a great supporter. It was an event that provided the opportunity for families to meet with MPs who are supportive and undecided about whether the law needs to change.</p>
<p>I was delighted to be re-elected Chair of the Women’s Parliamentary Labour Party. Labour has made great strides in this area – indeed 52% of the Parliamentary Labour Party are women. But more still must be done. I’m keen to ensure that we increase the 44% of candidates who have been selected being women to 50%.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I popped in to a reception hosted by the Youth Sport Trust. They were encouraging more schools to sign up for their National School Sports Week. The aim of their campaign is to ensure all children are active for 60 minutes a day – in line with the Chief Medical Officers advice. And what better way to do that than with a national sports day. It takes place between 19 June to 25 June. Currently, no schools in Bristol South have signed up so if anyone wants their school to sign up click the <a href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/join-us/nssw">link </a>to learn more!</p>
<p>On Thursday, I spoke in the Urgent Question secured by Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, on the new immigration figures. I put it to the minister that the Tories continues to badly managed immigration.</p>
<p>We have people stuck in hotels across the country. It&#8217;s appalling for those waiting for a decision &#038; is a huge cost to taxpayers. This is all because the Tories cannot clear the asylum backlog they created.</p>
<p>Then, during Business of the House statement, I raised my recent meeting with Action Greater Bedminster and how the housing crisis won’t be fixed if the Government doesn’t fix Primary Healthcare and improve public services. I’m clear: we need to build more homes. Decent homes which tackle climate change, give people a chance to put down roots and become a member of the community and drive our local economic growth. But none of that will be achieved if schools are full, you can’t get a GP appointment and our public transport is on its knees. I hope the Leader of the House listened carefully to my request for the Health and Levelling Up departments to work closely together and fix the shambles of our public services.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th November last year, if you’d walked into Parliament and stood close to the main voting office, you’d have seen a long winding queue of MPs and their staff nervously checking their phones.</p>
<p>That morning, all MPs were given an embargoed copy of the revised boundary changes for the next General Election. A new rule means that there can only be a 5% variance from the average quotas of electors per seat (around 73,000), meaning constituencies must be chopped and changed, and some abolished outright.</p>
<p>It’s an important process, and quite a nerve-wracking one. Not only do you run the risk of potentially losing your seat as an MP, but you also have to do your utmost to protect the character and community of the area you represent.</p>
<p>The new boundaries mean big changes right across Greater Manchester, but particularly in Tameside. The Denton and Reddish constituency – which I serve and has existed for 40 years &#8211; is being abolished.</p>
<p>The Audenshaw and Dukinfield wards will go into the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency, Reddish North and South will move into the Stockport constituency and the three Denton wards will be joined with Gorton &amp; Abbey Hey, Longsight, Levenshulme and Burnage in the city of Manchester to form a brand new Gorton and Denton constituency.</p>
<p>I am delighted to announce that I will be standing as the Labour Party’s candidate to become the Member of Parliament for the new Gorton and Denton seat.</p>
<p>This will be a vibrant, diverse and unique seat, and I am excited to have the opportunity to represent residents living in Gorton &amp; Abbey Hey, Longsight, Levenshulme and Burnage alongside my home town of Denton.</p>
<p>It almost goes without saying that I will be sad to say goodbye to Audenshaw, Dukinfield and Reddish. I’ve served these areas for 18 years, and it remains the honour of my life. I am so grateful to all the exceptional residents and councillors I’ve worked with over the years. I am proud of what we have achieved locally, and I know that valuable work will continue for years to come.</p>
<p>Until the next General Election, however, I remain the MP for Denton and Reddish, and as fully committed to the job as I have always been. I feel enormously privileged to do what I do and will continue to be a strong voice in Westminster for the people I represent.</p>

<p>MP for West Dunbartonshire Martin Docherty-Hughes has praised the hard work and dedication of local volunteers as part of National Volunteers’ Week 2023.</p>



<p>In a motion tabled at the House of Commons, local MP Martin thanked volunteers in West Dunbartonshire and across Scotland for their contribution to supporting communities through the cost-of-living crisis.</p>



<p><a href="https://volunteersweek.org/">National Volunteers’ Week</a> runs from 1<sup>st</sup> June until 7<sup>th</sup> June and aims to celebrate the important work done by charities, volunteers and their supporters.</p>



<p>Prior to becoming the area’s MP in 2015, Martin Docherty-Hughes spent over a decade working for West Dunbartonshire Community and Volunteering Services (WDCVS) &#8211; supporting and developing local community and volunteering organisations.</p>



<p>According to the Volunteers Scotland group, more than 1 in 4 of Scotland&#8217;s adult population volunteered in the past year &#8211; equating to over 1.2 million people.</p>



<p>WDCVS are hosting two local Volunteer fairs in Clydebank and Dumbarton on Tuesday 6th June for residents interested in volunteering. Further information is available on the WDCVS website: <a href="https://wdcvs.com/success-story/volunteers-week-2023-celebrate-inspire/">www.wdcvs.com</a></p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“I am proud to represent the communities of West Dunbartonshire which benefit so much from the dedication of local volunteers.</p>



<p>“As we mark Volunteers’ Week 2023, I want to put on record my thanks to everyone across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale who gives their time to help others.</p>



<p>“In challenging times, through Covid and the cost-of-living crisis, so many of our local charities and voluntary groups have stepped up to help those in need.</p>



<p>“Volunteers play a central role in our communities – from supporting local food banks in tackling food poverty, to volunteering as a befriender and helping combat loneliness.</p>



<p>“For anyone interested in voluntary work, volunteer fairs organised by WDCVS in Clydebank and Dumbarton are a great opportunity to find out more.”</p>



<p><strong>Alan Stevenson, Chief Executive of Volunteers Scotland, said:</strong></p>



<p>“Volunteers are the lifeblood of Scottish communities and what better time to celebrate their very many vital contributions than during Volunteers’ Week.</p>



<p>“In celebrating volunteers and sharing their stories, we highlight the enormous breadth of volunteering opportunities on offer and demonstrate the many benefits – especially for volunteers.”</p>

              <h3>Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil says island families are paying the price for Westminster failure – amid warnings energy bills will not return to 2021 levels until around 2030 at the earliest.</p>



<p>While the Ofgem energy price cap has today been reduced slightly to £2,074 a year for the typical household from July, energy prices will still be around double what they were in 2021 (£1042) and they are expected to rise again in January. The figure will be even higher for island residents which has one of the highest levels of fuel poverty in the UK.</p>



<p>The UK government has also withdrawn the £400 energy bill rebate for households, and household incomes are falling behind the UK&#8217;s soaring inflation &#8211; leaving families worse off than they were pre-pandemic.</p>



<p>Commenting, Angus MacNeil MP said: &#8220;Families in Na h-Eileanan an Iar are paying the price for Westminster failure, with the typical household energy bill double what it was in 2021 and wages falling behind soaring inflation &#8211; showing exactly why Scotland needs to escape Westminster control as an independent country.</p>



<p>&#8220;Scotland is an energy-rich country and it&#8217;s absurd the UK government is forcing families to pay through the nose for a resource we have in abundance, while it refuses to reinvest the huge profits it is raking in from Scotland&#8217;s north sea oil and gas.</p>



<p>&#8220;Westminster should be using these profits to give families in Scotland an energy bill rebate &#8211; and it should match the ambition of progressive SNP government policies, like the £25 a week Scottish Child Payment, to help families struggling with the cost of living.</p>



<p>&#8220;The SNP is the only party in Scotland offering a real alternative to the damaging policies of the Tories and pro-Brexit Labour Party &#8211; and only a vote for the SNP at the next election can deliver the real change Scotland needs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following the Ofgem announcement, Cornwall Insight warned “Despite the cap falling from the sky-high prices of the past two years, the figure remains over £1,000 per year more than the price cap levels seen prior to the pandemic&#8230; We do not currently expect bills to return to pre-2020 levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.”</p>



<p>Campaigners from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition also warned “People now face many more months with bills remaining stubbornly high. This will see them continue to use up their savings for everyday items, run up credit card bills, fall into debt with energy firms or turn to food banks as the cost of living crisis deepens.”</p>

<p>Today in Parliament I told the Tory immigration minister, Robert Jenrick MP, how shocked and concerned we are to hear that he is planning to house 300 Asylum seekers in the Stradey Park Hotel. </p>



<p>I asked him to meet me to hear our concerns and asked him what he is doing to prevent the need to commandeer the Stradey Park Hotel, and to sort out the Home Office backlog of 160,000 claims so those from safe countries can be returned and those who are genuine refugees can move out of hotels and be integrated in small numbers into suitable communities.</p>



<p>He refused to answer and failed to agree to even meet with me to listen to the views of local people on the subject. </p>

<p>Judith Cummins MP (Bradford South) has challenged the Government to lower costs of a family shop following news that basic ingredients like sugar had risen by nearly 50%.</p>



<p><br>Questioning the Government in Parliament, Judith asked:</p>



<p>‘Sugar prices have risen a massive 47% in the past year, and industry experts predict it will rise again this autumn due to the high energy costs of extracting and refining sugar.’</p>



<p>‘Will the Minister outline what steps the Government is undertaking to support the food and drinks sector throughout this period of extreme inflationary pressure, so that these costs are not yet again passed on to consumers?’</p>



<p>Responding, the Minister acknowledged the pressures the industry was facing:</p>



<p>‘We are very keen to help and support [the Food and Drinks sector] with new technology, with investment in genetic technologies to improve sugar beet yields, and we will continue to have those conversations.’</p>



<p>‘We are very much aware of the pressures on global sugar prices which is why we need a thriving and productive sugar market here in the UK.’</p>



<p>Speaking afterwards, Judith said:</p>



<p>‘We are in a period of high inflation, and the Government must act now to address this, so my constituents don’t have to struggle to feed their families.’</p>

<p>This week is Commonwealth War Graves Week.</p>
<p>Across Aldridge-Brownhills we have 44 graves, across 5 different cemeteries, that are covered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission carry out excellent work to honour and care for the men and women of the Commonwealth who died in the First and Second World Wars. The CWGC ensure these individuals will never be forgotten, with over 2,500 war cemeteries and over a million burials at military and civil sites around the world. For individuals who have no known grave, they have built memorials to the missing as <a href="https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/commemorations/">places of commemoration</a>.</p>
<p>The work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission continues through their staff, supporters and volunteers who ensure that the stories of those who died are told. This year they invite us to <strong>Discover</strong>, <strong>Learn</strong> and <strong>Remember</strong> about the lives of the 1.7million men and women of the Commonwealth commemorated by the CWGC.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and all those who volunteer locally.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the briefing about the forthcoming <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3443">Victims and Prisoners Bill</a>, which was organised by Alex Mayes from <a href="https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/">Victim Support</a>, an independent charity dedicated to supporting people affected by crime and traumatic incidents in England and Wales. It provides all types of free confidential support 24-hours a day, 365 days a year, regardless of whether the crime has been reported. The Victims and Prisoners Bill received its Second Reading on Monday 15<sup>th</sup> May. Victim Support has called for a Bill to strengthen the rights and improve the experiences of crime victims, but this Bill falls short. Victim Support recommends that the Bill should return to its original form concentrating on victims; the enforcement of victims’ rights should be strengthened; the definition of victim should be broadened to include victims of persistent anti-social behaviour; and all victims must have access to specialist support services that are independent of the police and statutory services. The Bill contains welcome measures to improve data collection for the Victim’s Code, but this relies on the information being comprehensive and robust, so Victim Support urge the UK Government to ensure all rights within the Bill are monitored and reported on by responsible agencies under the Code. The Bill needs to do more to increase the oversight and enforcement of noncompliance by agencies. The parole measures in the new Bill have not been subject to the same degree of pre-legislative scrutiny as for the victims’ part, and will detract from the promised landmark Victims’ Law, and detracts from the UK Government’s commitment to put victims’ interests firmly at the heart of the justice system, given that victims won’t even be at the heart of this Bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the <a href="https://twitter.com/APPGStemCell">APPG on Stem Cell Transplantation and Advanced Cellular Therapies</a> chaired by my friend Mark Tami MP, who has for many years been a champion for people who are seeking or have undergone a stem cell transplant, we discussed how patients and families are being impacted by the cost-of-living crisis, the cost of undergoing a transplant, the support currently available, and considered possible policy solutions. We listened to the Shadow Health Minister Andrew Gwynne MP; Cheryl Bell, Haematology and Haemophilia Social Worker, Newcastle Council; and Tom Bishop, Head of Patient Information at Anthony Nolan. As chair of the APPG on Sepsis I offered that our APPG work jointly with Mark’s APPG, which Mark accepted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to be elected as a vice chair at the AGM of the reconstituted Climate Change APPG, Caroline Lucas MP was elected as chair and Uplift are the secretariat. Uplift is a climate-based organisation founded by Tessa Khan and funded by charitable foundations. The APPG has five goals designed to re-power the UK in a way that safeguards the planet for future generations, whilst unlocking opportunities, strengthening energy security, and cutting the cost of living. The goals include transforming the North Sea’s economic future; boosting energy by scaling the alternatives; building a net zero workforce; aligning energy development with nature protection; and encouraging UK climate leadership on the world stage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology, I joined my vice-chair John McNally MP in meeting with the new registrar, chair, and members of the Hair Council Board to listen to their aims and objectives for the next few years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dwr Cymru Welsh Water held the parliamentary launch of its <a href="https://corporate.dwrcymru.com/en/news-media/2023/welsh-water-publishes-manifesto-for-rivers-in-wales-and-plans-record-environmental-investment#:~:text=The%20Manifesto%20for%20Rivers%20in,Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation%20(SAC">Manifesto for Rivers in Wales</a>. The report includes the total phosphorus load and improvement schemes for the rivers Cleddau, Dee, Teifi, Usk and Wye. But it does mention Neath in that there will be investment during the period 2025-30 for the Trebanos Wastewater Treatment Works to increase the flow passed forward through the treatment works for Afon Tawe. Dwr Cymru are conducting a survey with customers and stakeholders to support people to enjoy open water swimming at coastal and inland waters which may not be recognised as official swimming sites or pools. The results are expected this month and will inform Dwr Cymru investment plans for 2025-30.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG for Rare Diseases, chaired by Liz Twist MP met to receive an update from Louise Fish, CEO of Genetic Alliance UK, and discuss their report “<a href="https://geneticalliance.org.uk/coordinatingcarereport2023/">Coordinating Care: Learning from the experiences of people living with rare conditions</a>“. In this meeting we focused on Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and received a presentation from Consultant Paediatric Neurologist University Hospitals Bristol, Sam Amim, which is featured on pages 30-31 of the report. We listened to a number of people whose children and families are living with the very rare disease TSC, and the challenges and difficulties they have experienced in getting a diagnosis, plus subsequent medical and education support.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Co-chairs for <a href="https://www.gov.wales/independent-commission-constitutional-future-wales">The Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales</a>, The Rt. Revd. and Rt. Hon. Rowan Williams and Professor Laura McAllister, held a briefing for parliamentarians from all parties on its interim report, consultation, and answered questions from the Peers and MPs who were in the room. They were accompanied by commissioners Albert Owen, former MP for Ynys Mon; Miguela Gonzales, Head of Diversity at Abcam; former civil servant for 30 years, Phillip Rycroft; and Conservative former UK Government Special Adviser to the Wales Office, Lauren McEvatt. The cross-party commission was set up by Welsh Government in November 2021, with two broad objectives: to consider and develop options for the fundamental reform of the constitutional structures of the UK, in which Wales is an integral part; to consider and develop all progressive principal options to strengthen Welsh democracy and deliver improvements for the people of Wales. The commission took oral evidence from politicians, academics, and civil society, plus a public consultation which attracted 2524 online contributions. A community engagement fund was set up to support community groups/organisations to hold engagement projects to facilitate the commissioners meeting with community groups, including youth sector, care sector, and ethnic minorities, because they wanted to learn what the people of Wales want and need. The interim report was published in December 2022, and it sets out the framework options from the results of the consultation: entrenched devolution; a federal UK; and independence. The commission sought views on the framework and new/supplementary evidence by May 2023, and its final report will use a prepared objective base analysis, and test the robustness of the initial findings, to make sure that Wales is on the front foot regarding governance and powers. The final report will be published by the end of 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was proud to be elected the treasurer for the <a href="https://www.ukmusic.org/about/all-party-parliamentary-group-on-music/">APPG for Music</a> at its AGM, having served as a vice chair for many years. My dear friend Kevin Brennan MP was re-elected as chair, and I’m pleased to continue to support Kevin in all the good work that he does to highlight the wonderful benefits that music, its performers, and the music industry provides to the public all over the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the AGM of the APPG on State Pension Inequality for Women, Andrew Gwynne MP and Peter Aldous MP were re-elected co-chairs and I was re-elected a vice chair.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://appg-humanrights.org.uk/">All-Party Parliamentary Human Rights Group</a> (PHRG) held a drop in event titled – <em>Levelling the playing field for UK companies: Mandatory supply chain due diligence to protect human rights and the environment</em>. The event was sponsored by the APPGs on Ethical and Sustainability in Fashion and Trade Justice, CAFOD, and Friends of the Earth. We listened to campaigners speak about the emerging new global standard for regulating global supply chains; mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence; and the proposed new law for the UK. Businesses, investors, and civil society demonstrated their support for a new law to bring the UK into alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the increasing number of countries adopting new due diligence laws. Leading UK companies explained why they backed the call for new UK legislation which would, inter alia, level the playing field by mandating supply chain due diligence and increase legal certainty about standards expected from the business sector. Organisations at the event included: Anti-Slavery International; Aviva; Business and Human Rights Resource Centre; Ethical Trading Initiative; John Lewis Partnership; Marshalls PLC. In 2022, a G7 Leaders Communique, and UK businesses, investors, and business associations all supported the new law. Whilst I was at the event I signed <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/60909/potential-merits-of-new-legislation-on-mandatory-corporate-due-diligence">EDM 1169</a> created by my long-time friend Tony Lloyd MP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the <a href="https://www.fightbladdercancer.co.uk/">Fight Bladder Cancer</a> (FBC) awareness event which is campaigning for better outcomes for people living with bladder cancer, their families and carers. FBC is a national charity dedicated to changing patients’ lives for the better, providing information and support on what to expect at various stages of bladder cancer, connecting people to share their experiences and to help one another. Over 21,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year in the UK and FBC are calling for a standardised pathway for the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of bladder cancer and better investment in the BC workforce in 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected a vice chair at the AGM for the <a href="https://www.appgcoalfields.co.uk/">APPG on Coalfield Communities</a>. We agreed work plans for the forthcoming release of our enquiry: <em>Next Steps in Levelling Up the Former Coalfields</em>. The enquiry was launched last November, and received submissions from public and private sectors across the UK. The members of the APPG believe that the former coalfield regions are now at a critical juncture, but we have an opportunity to make representations to ministers to shape the levelling up agenda for years to come. I look forward to the publication and launch of the APPG’s enquiry report in early June.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As part of <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/symptoms-and-diagnosis/worried-memory-problems-or-dementia?sc=daw23&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=daw23&amp;gad=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyLGjBhDKARIsAFRNgW8HeYCsfRL5M-hL7PU5EqLkMq4AzwhhhnkY5E78h4oUfYljsFhtBZUaAsOjEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Dementia Action Week</a> (15-21 May) I attended a Parliamentary reception hosted by <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Rebrand+23&amp;gad=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyLGjBhDKARIsAFRNgW_ZIv734tpAtDlaxlrYGTBmhmjD-ptxPjwQ2juDEOTiw2c6sYC2GC0aAr_iEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Alzheimer’s Society</a>, which stressed the importance of getting a dementia diagnosis with the tagline “It’s not called getting old, it’s called getting ill” and it encourages people worried about their own or a loved one’s memory to seek support in getting a diagnosis using a symptoms check list available on the Alzheimer’s online hub. In England, the dementia diagnosis rate fell below the national ambition during the pandemic, and has remained around 62% since, so more than 30,000 have missed out on a diagnosis. Unfortunately, in Wales the scale of the problem is unknown because data is not collected. The Alzheimer’s Society believe that around 50,000 people in Wales are living with Dementia, but there is no way of knowing how many have been diagnosed, so they are calling for comprehensive diagnosis data to be collected in Wales so that this can be published centrally on a national level so that Wales can be compared to other parts of the UK. The Alzheimer’s Society believe that everyone living with dementia deserves an accurate, timely, and high-quality dementia diagnosis so that they can access vital care, support, and plan for their future.</p>

Political crises come and go, but the crisis of social care has been growing for decades, and still needs a comprehensive solution. I have been trying to push it up the political agenda for years and will keep doing so, for a number of reasons.
The first is that it is simply not right for such an…

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p>Nottingham Labour confirmed today (22 May) at Full Council the political and civic leadership of the city, after securing an increased majority at the local elections. A total of 51 out of 55 councillors at Nottingham City Council, are now Labour. This gives us a strong mandate to implement the manifesto over the next four years and continue to fight for and improve the lives of Nottingham residents.<br></p>



<p>Councillor David Mellen will remain as Leader of the council, continuing the hard work of continuing the hard work of himself, Cllr Adele Williams, Cllr Sally Longford and all previous and current executive and backbench members. He is responsible for continuing devolution, strategic regeneration, development and work on the city’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral by 2028, as well as promoting the vision of the council and supporting all of his Portfolio Holders in their work. There is much work to be done over the next term and the new executive will be key in achieving the goals Nottingham Labour want for the city.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Audra Wynter has been confirmed as the new Deputy Leader and she will have responsibility for the finance and HR portfolios. With a background in finance work, Councillor Wynter will ensure the council remains on track in delivering a balanced budget and sticking to the Medium-Term Financial Plan, while delivering high-quality services for residents.</p>



<p><br></p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Councillor Corall Jenkins will be taking over as Portfolio Holder for Energy, Environment and Waste Services and Parks. She will have responsibility for key services such as bin collection and disposal, keeping our city’s streets clean and maintaining all of our wonderful parks.</p>



<p>Councillor Cheryl Barnard will remain as Portfolio Holder for Children, Young People and Education. She will continue to be responsible for leading our children’s services, working with Ofsted to improve it where necessary, ensuring children’s safeguarding and working with academy trusts across the city on schools, ensuring attendance and working to reduce exclusions, so that all children get the best start in life.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Steve Battlemuch will be taking up the reins as Portfolio Holder for Skills, Growth, Economic Development and Property. He will lead on skills and employment, ensuring that the workforce in the city is prepared for any changes in the way we work, and that the people of this city have the right opportunities. He will also oversee the management of the city centre, attracting investment and helping to ensure that Nottingham is promoted nationally and internationally to business and tourism.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Jay Hayes has been confirmed as the new Portfolio Holder for Housing. He will lead on managing the council housing service, student housing, private rented properties and areas such as selective licensing and homelessness. Housing is incredibly important, all those who live in the city deserve to have a property that is safe, secure and that can be called home, whether they rent in the private sector or have social housing.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Sajid Mohammed will lead as Portfolio Holder for Neighbourhoods, Safety and Inclusion. This covers areas such as community protection, domestic violence work, licensing, taxi strategy and more. It is so important that Nottingham is a safe place to work and live in. Councillor Mohammed with many years of experience of community work and as director of Himmah will bring the required expertise to lead in these vital areas, and he will also lead on refugee and asylum seeker work, to ensure that Nottingham is a welcoming city for all, and that those vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers can integrate and make new lives in Nottingham.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Pavlos Kotsonis will continue as Portfolio Holder for Leisure and Culture. He will ensure that we continue to offer an outstanding events programme. He will also oversee the reopening and flourishing of the Castle, the continued running of Wollaton Hall and Newstead Abbey as well as leisure centres, markets, libraries and community centres across the city. Access to cultural events and key things like libraries and leisure centres is so important for allowing the people of the city to thrive and create.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Linda Woodings will also remain as Portfolio Holder for Adult Social Care and Health. She will continue to work on Public Health and Wellbeing, tackling health inequalities and working to reduce smoking prevalence, working on mental health and generally improving the health of residents in the city. She will also lead on independent living. All of these will help to improve the quality and length of life for residents in the city for years to come.<br></p>



<p>Finally, Councillor Angela Kandola will be taking over as Portfolio Holder for Highways, Transport and Planning. She will oversee public transport such as buses and the tram. She will also lead on greener transport such as cycling and cycling links in the city, ensure highways are correctly managed and repaired as well as the Workplace Parking Levy to help increase public transport usage.<br></p>



<p>This is just a short summary of the responsibilities that the Executive will have for the next year. They will bring both their expertise and new views to help ensure that there is strong and effective political leadership at the council. This will continue both our journey with the Improvement and Assurance Board but also enable us to bring in the pledges that we made to the residents of the city in our manifesto in the May local elections.</p>

The children are clearly enjoying their time there very much, and it was really helpful to get an insight from Miss Hardy and her team as to how everyone’s getting on. Plus, I enjoyed a brilliant sit-down with the School Council &#8211; they really put me through my paces with their questions.”<br><br>Megan Hardy, the Head of School at Peartree, thanked Mr Shapps for visiting and meeting with the staff and students:<br><br>“It was a pleasure to show Mr Shapps around Peartree and to talk to him about our plans for the school’s transformation over the coming years.”<br><br>She continued:<br><br>“The children were really excited to meet their MP and they came up with plenty of interesting questions to ask him. They were very inspired by his visit, so we may even have a future prime minister among us!”&nbsp;<br><br>Mr Shapps thanks Peartree for having him visit and wishes the staff and students all the best for the future.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>

<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684233937.JPG" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I visited Kings Heath Boys School last week which has just had a fine Ofsted report reflecting real progress achieved under four years of the current Head’s leadership.</p>



<p>It’s only by providing good schools that we can equip our children and grandchildren for the future. There’s always been a link between poor areas and school success. Labour understands this. In the 60s and 70s the Wilson government created Educational Priority Areas and after 18 years of Tory rule, the last Labour government introduced Education Action Zones to once again boost the chances of children from poorer backgrounds.</p>



<p>It’s by working with parents and carers and putting schools at the centre of communities that we build the solid foundations from which children succeed. Over 13 years of Tory rule, we’ve seen teachers abused and experts ridiculed and an attempt to return schools to teaching models experienced by too many government ministers, in private schools, over the past 50 years. It’s not structures like free schools or academisation or gimmicks about a smattering of Latin that matter. We need support for parents and programmes to attract the best teachers to disadvantaged areas.</p>



<p>Almost every successful person has a story about the teacher who influenced their direction and put them on a path to success. We need to rediscover an ambition and love for education.</p>



<p>At Kings Heath Boys they’re not planning to rest on their laurels but open up choice and opportunity by changing to an intake of boys and girls. We’re blessed with several outstanding schools in south Birmingham, they do a remarkable job despite squeezed budgets, teacher retention problems and children’s mental health issues. These are all things the government should be addressing.</p>



<p>I hope the local community will get behind plans for Kings Heath Boys which will give more children a chance to attend a school that’s best for them. I’m hungry for a Labour government that treats teachers with the respect they deserve and puts our children first.</p>



<p>It’s time to focus on a system where the talents of every child can be nurtured and where their achievements are the priority.</p>

<p>As he hadn&#8217;t commissioned this company in the first place, he demanded to see the application form, which was such a poor forgery that both his and his wife&#8217;s signature were clearly in the same handwriting.</p>



<p>With the government repeatedly warning the public not to fall for financial scams, it&#8217;s incredible that the HMRC fell for this one.</p>



<p>So can we have a Treasury statement, so we can understand the extent of this problem, what&#8217;s being done to prevent it in the future, and when constituents like mine will actually get their money from the HMRC.</p>



<p><strong>Government response</strong>:<br>Well, I thank the Honourable Lady for raising this case. I&#8217;m very sorry to hear that. </p>



<p>She may of course wish to raise it at Treasury questions on the 9th of May.</p>



<p>But given this is a sizable chunk of money for them to be out of pocket with, I will certainly raise this today with HMRC and ask them to contact the Honourable Lady with regard to this case.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>The cross party Work and Pensions Select Committee responsible for scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) policies, has published a damning report on the Government’s health assessments system which is used to screen whether sick and disabled people should have access to vital social security payments.</p>
<p>These payments provide financial support to a working age person who is unable to work because of their health condition or disability; the assessment for this is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and is for either Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work. In addition there is also the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment process to access support to cover the extra costs disabled people face because of their disability which are estimated at over £580 a month on average; this is for the Personal Independence Payment.</p>
<p>The report exposed the detrimental impact of the assessment process itself on the health and well being of claimants.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the Committee, Professor Ben Barr, from the University of Liverpool, was asked about research he carried out in 2015 which looked at the impacts of the WCA as claimants were reassessed to move onto Employment Support Allowance. His analysis estimated that across England, the WCA had caused an additional 600 suicides, 300,000 additional cases of mental health problems and a large rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over a nine-year period.</p>
<p>&#8220;We looked at whether it could be explained by other factors or other economic trends, but there was quite a unique pattern in the increase in mental health problems, and the most likely explanation was that it was due to the reassessment process&#8221;, he told the committee. He said it is difficult to assess improvements since this study as &#8220;there are no systems in place&#8221; to monitor the impact of the health assessments and the potential adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>A survey by the University of Kent last year found half of claimants who have been through the WCA process said it made their mental health worse. Dr Ben Baumberg Geiger, who led the research, told the committee: &#8220;It is not sufficient to say that this is a historical problem and that everything is fine now. If there was more transparency, it would be easier to know a bit more about it, but the evidence suggests that there are still major problems with the WCA that could lead to an increased risk of poor mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth and a Member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee said:</p>
<p><em>“The evidence is clear &#8211; the current system is not fit for purpose. The DWP’s own figures show that <strong><u>274 people a month</u></strong> <strong><u>die 6 months after being found fit for work </u></strong>and <strong><u>60 people a month die 3 months after having PIP refused. </u></strong>These are poorly people not the shirkers and scroungers that some Conservatives refer to when discussing social security claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“We heard evidence during the inquiry that when people were being reassessed between 2010 and 2013, there were 600 additional suicides. In 2020, National Audit Office has said that the claimant deaths that the DWP had investigated were the tip of the iceberg. The current approach is contributing, directly and indirectly, to the physical and mental health harm of claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“Last year the Equality Watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, issued a Section 23 order against the Department of Work and Pensions over their discriminatory treatment of disabled claimants.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Government itself has effectively acknowledged a different approach is needed when they announced that they would abolition the Work Capability Assessments, something I have been calling for years, but the detail of the future process is too opaque and doesn’t provide reassurance. Given it will take place several years to replace, what happens until then?</em></p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update on a few local matters.</p>
<p>First of all, for those of you intending to vote in the local elections in May, a reminder if you did not know, that you will need to take photo ID with you to the polling station. This is part of a new approach to avoid people impersonating someone else by voting in their name.</p>
<p>There are details on Council websites for Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead and what to do if you do not have a suitable form of ID.</p>

<h2>Stoneleigh Railway Crossing</h2>
<p>For those of you living in the Stoneleigh area, work is due to start soon on the new step free crossing over the railway at the station. I hope this will make things much easier for people with mobility issues, not to mention small children in buggies or heavy shopping bags.</p>
<p>This is a timetable for the planned work.</p>

<h2>One Day Travel Cards</h2>
<p>Transport for London has just announced that it is planning to scrap paper one day travelcards from outside London, which is likely to affect many people in our area. I will be lodging an objection to this, particularly as it is happening at the same time as the proposed ULEZ. If you want to find out more, they have published details at</p>

<p>Although the feedback form on this site is pretty limited, I would encourage you to share any opinions about the proposal via the link.</p>
<h2>Veterans Group</h2>
<p>In the last bulletin I gave you details of the support for veterans in Epsom and Ewell. I have been asked to remind those living in Mole Valley about the veterans hub for those living in the district, which is also providing valuable support locally. You can find out all the details at</p>

<p>The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking after the visit <strong>Matt Warman MP commented</strong> ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith</strong> who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’</p>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world&#8217;s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />

Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<br />
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.<br />
<br />
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.<br />
<br />
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.<br />
<br />
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.<br />
<br />
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.<br />
<br />
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.<br />
<br />
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.<br />
<br />
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.<br />
<br />
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.<br />
<br />
We have a historic debt of honour to them.<br />

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br />
<br />
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br />
<br />
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br />
<br />
Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br />
<br />
<i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br />
<br />
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br />
<br />
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br />
<br />
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br />
<br />
