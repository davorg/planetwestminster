<p>I thank the Minister for advance sight of his statement and for keeping the House informed of progress. The Horizon scandal is perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice in our country’s history. Its victims have waited for justice for far too long. I pay tribute to the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance for its tireless work and acknowledge the work of colleagues on both sides of the House who have gone to considerable lengths to highlight the plight of their constituents. In particular, I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones), whose commitment to the cause has been unwavering, and to Lord Arbuthnot in the other place.</p>
<p>I also pay tribute to the Minister—and I do not say that lightly. Successive Conservative Governments have sat on the scandal, but he has made real progress in moving us to a place where we can see that justice is in sight. I acknowledge that. I also welcome the update on the March announcement that, as Labour has repeatedly called for, the 505 litigants will receive the compensation payments that they are entitled to. However, I emphasise that, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge, it is unacceptable that it has taken so long when the right course of action was always clear. There really was no need for victims to have spent so long in limbo.</p>
<p>At the core of this unforgivable scandal is the belief that workers were dishonest and technology was infallible. Perhaps that is not surprising, given the Government’s track record on defending the rights of working people. Decent, honest people have had their lives torn apart, been put in prison and been made to wait years for justice. For some, that wait has been too long. We must not forget those who are not with us and will not see the justice to which they were so entitled.</p>
<p>As I have previously done in the Chamber, I implore the Minister to act quickly and decisively to draw a line under this horrific miscarriage of justice. There can be no further delays in providing the compensation that will go at least some way in helping to right this wrong. As such, will he provide a timescale for when all compensation payments will have been made? Will he confirm that the compensation will not affect the Post Office’s core funding, day-to-day operations or viability in—I stress this—any way? Given the vital role that post offices perform in our communities—we all acknowledge that—it is essential that today’s communities are not made to pay for the unacceptable mistakes of the past. Labour has called for all those involved to be held accountable. Will he therefore update the House on what investigations are ongoing into the role of Fujitsu and others involved in the technology that led to the failure?</p>
<p>The Minister spoke about learning the lessons from this horrific scandal. The Government were, and remain, the only shareholder in the Post Office. They have a financial responsibility and a moral responsibility to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.</p>

<p>To move the following Clause—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Community right of appeal </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 is amended as follows.</li>
<li>After section 78 (right to appeal against planning decisions and failure to take such decisions) insert—</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>“78ZA Community right of appeal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Secretary of State must by regulations make provision—</li>
<li>enabling communities to appeal against a decision to grant planning permission or permission in principle for a development, and</li>
<li>about such appeals.</li>
<li>The regulations may require a certain number or proportion of residents of a local area to record objection against a decision for such an appeal to proceed.</li>

<p>This new clause would introduce a community right of appeal against the granting of planning permission</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> Amendment 57</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clause 83, page 91, line 30, leave out “national development management policy” and insert “the development plan”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member&#8217;s explanatory statement </strong></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member&#8217;s explanatory statement</strong></p>

<p>I add my thanks to the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)—it is good to see him in his place—and the members of his Committee for agreeing to the proposal from me, the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, the hon. Member for Bristol North West (Darren Jones), together with my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Bim Afolami), who respectively chair the all-party parliamentary groups on the environment and on renewable and sustainable energy. I thank them for supporting the opportunity to have this debate to discuss the Government’s spending plans for action on climate change and decarbonisation.</p>

<p>This is a timely day for the debate, not least given the publication last week of the Climate Change Committee’s annual progress report to Parliament for 2022. The Environmental Audit Committee—it is good to see members of my Committee in the Chamber, and I hope they will have an opportunity to catch your eye during this short debate, Mr Deputy Speaker—will be discussing the report in more detail with the chair of the CCC next week, but its headline message is unarguable. There are major gaps—some might say failures—in the programmes designed to deliver the UK’s climate goals, and I am sorry to have to say that.</p>

<p>I sympathise with my hon Friend the Minister who will be responding to this debate. Russian’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted energy supplies and enormously exacerbated the demand pressures as economies recover from the pandemic. However, the scale of the current geopolitical crisis and the shock it has delivered to global energy markets clearly requires rapid recalibration of his Department’s strategy. That is not the topic of this debate, so I shall not refer to it in detail, but the cost of living crisis, to which the current price shock has contributed, is affecting us all, and the House will have an opportunity to discuss the Government’s legislative proposals on that issue later. This provides an important backdrop to the House’s consideration of the priorities for Government expenditure. There is a cost of living crisis that is making daily life extremely difficult for all of our constituents, including the most vulnerable.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=3930">Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green)</a></h3>

<p>The right hon. Member is talking about the recalibration that is needed in the Department. Does he agree with me that one area where that is extremely true is the need for a proper home insulation programme? We have never seen this Government get that right, in spite of the £11.7 billion allocated to the energy bills support scheme, which is of course welcome. What we need is a proper home insulation programme—street by street, local authority-led—and we still do not have it.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>The hon. Lady makes a very important point, and she made a strong contribution to our Committee’s report on the inquiry into the energy efficiency of existing homes. I will comment on that in my remarks, but I broadly agree with her.</p>

<p>It is right that the Government do what they can to align their spending priorities to support all those who are being squeezed, but as the CCC reminded us last week, we are also in a future of living crisis. Large-scale changes in climactic conditions are undeniable, and they have the potential to make parts of the globe uninhabitable, provoking a crisis of barely imaginable severity. So it is entirely appropriate, in Net Zero Week, that the House consider in a little more detail the spending that the lead Department on net zero is proposing in the current financial year to tackle climate change and to address decarbonisation of the economy.</p>

<p>In October 2021, just before the COP26 conference in Glasgow, the Government produced their net zero strategy. This is an ambitious document, ranging widely across all areas of Government. It presents the first wide-ranging plan across Government to build on the initial 10-point plan for the green industrial revolution, which the Prime Minister presented in November 2020. It demonstrates that the Government are in the business of climate mitigation and climate adaptation for the long term. I would argue that there is broad consensus across the parties in the House that this has to be the direction of travel. It also reflects the broad scientific consensus that the planet is under threat from climate change as never before in recorded history, and that our behaviour must change in certain ways if we are to be able to avoid the worst effects. However, my concern is that the Government’s strategy seems, in too many areas, to defer substantive action and to leave real expenditure to a future date—and, dare I say it, possibly to a future electoral cycle. The warning from the Committee on Climate Change last week surely demands that more immediate action is taken to achieve the Government’s priorities and net-zero ambition.</p>

<p>My Committee had an interesting exchange last week with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He disagreed with the thrust of the CCC’s conclusions, which he thought did not make sufficient allowance for the potential contribution of technology to mitigation of the climate crisis. That is a perfectly reasonable debating point. Indeed, our Committee has looked at a number of technologies that can play their part in achieving our net-zero ambition. However, I say gently to those on the Treasury Bench, that waiting for the right technology to turn up is not a strategy.</p>

<p>The Committee has been looking at potential solutions to help decarbonise the economy, from tidal power to offshore wind—there is significant emphasis on that in the Government’s strategy—and heat pumps, where there is ambition, but currently a significant gap in delivery. As the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and the Minister for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change will know—we wrote to them about this—the current state of development of negative emissions technologies does not promise a “silver bullet” from carbon capture and storage plants, which by 2050 will snatch carbon from the air and allow us all to go on as before. It is simply not there yet.</p>

<p>The Chancellor’s spending review last autumn gave a breakdown of the Government’s expected expenditure on net-zero measures in each year to 2024-25. In total, the Government plan to spend £25.6 billion on net-zero measures over that period, with £5.5 billion to be spent in the current financial year—subject, of course, to the House’s approval of these spending plans tomorrow. There are concerns about how effective that spending will be, and the Public Accounts Committee has recently been critical about the overall funding of the net-zero transition. The House is right to be concerned about the value for money of such approaches, and I commend the National Audit Office for its detailed and expert analysis of the Government’s plans.</p>

<p>The excellent briefing on the Department’s estimate, produced by the House of Commons Library for this debate, indicates that £21.8 billion—20% of the Department’s budget for this year—is dedicated to reducing UK greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. I do not include in that figure the £11.6 billion for the reduction in energy bills announced as part of the Government’s measures to address the cost of living crisis. Although the Government list that as a measure contributing to the net-zero target, I do not think that short-term energy bill reductions should be treated as a net-zero measure, unless somehow they are linked to fossil fuel reduction measures more directly.</p>

<p>I will focus the remainder of my brief remarks on the points that my Committee made last session in its report on the energy efficiency of existing homes, to which the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) referred. It seems that this is the area where greatest progress can be made towards the net-zero target, and in the shortest time. It was also the area that many witnesses before the Committee identified as a missing component from the recent energy security strategy.</p>

<p>I was pleased that late last month Ministers laid before Parliament the draft legislation needed to implement the fourth energy company obligation scheme. That hugely successful scheme has driven energy efficiency improvements in a great many domestic properties. Such improvements will reduce consumer bills. They will also reduce energy consumption, and thereby emissions from power generation. In the nine years of the scheme’s operation to date, it has supported cavity wall insulation in over 1 million properties. That is impressive, but there are still some 19 million homes that need upgrading to energy performance certificate band C. The cost estimate on which our Committee received evidence averaged £18,000 per property. Our Committee, I am afraid, found that the Government estimate for decarbonising Britain’s housing stock by 2050, at some £65 billion overall, was highly likely to be a significant underestimate. Welcome though the ECO is—last month, the chair of E.ON told the Committee about industry support for the scheme—it represents only a small fraction of what is genuinely necessary to achieve domestic energy efficiency. Will the Minister be in a position to elaborate further on the Department’s plans to drive energy efficiency in existing homes? It is not immediately apparent in the spending plans that the House is examining.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the average householder will be able to afford a one-off payment of about £20,000 to upgrade their property without some incentive from the centre. I do not want to hark back to the green homes grant voucher scheme, but I hope that the Government have learned the lessons from its introduction. It was a well-meaning scheme that could have kick-started energy efficiency improvement, but it was strangled by red tape and ultimately abandoned in less than a year, having reached only a fraction of the homes that it was expected to improve.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=3912">Richard Fuller (North East Bedfordshire) (Con)</a></h3>

<p>I wonder whether my right hon. Friend might address community-led schemes, which were the other thing that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) mentioned. Is not one reason why costs are so high because the Government’s strategy is focused on individuals making a decision about their house, rather than being a more comprehensive approach that could achieve better economies of scale, certainly in service delivery?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>The Government have been focusing on social housing, which is typically owned in relatively large unit blocks together in a street or an estate. In many cases, such schemes are community energy schemes. For example, I have seen geothermal being introduced across an entire estate in my constituency. The Committee is looking at the prospects for geothermal to provide community-based schemes. There is a big role for that to play, but it is a part of the whole that will not be suitable for every area or every housing type.</p>

<p>The Government are taking steps, but I see them as overly cautious. However, I strongly welcomed the Chancellor’s announcement in the spring statement that removed VAT on energy efficiency measures for domestic homes. I expect that Ministers will be measuring its impact in the expectation that it will be a pathfinder to extensively rolling out similar support—for example, on batteries for domestic energy storage, which, as I understand it, are currently excluded from the scheme.</p>

<p>It is clear that the current energy cost crisis is leading to soaring public interest in energy efficiency measures to cut bills. For a Government willing to invest wisely, that represents a real opportunity for substantial returns not just to the Exchequer, but to the householder through cut bills and to the planet in reducing emissions. I do not expect the public sector to pick up the bill for energy efficiency improvements, but, with the right support, the private sector can be properly incentivised to take the lead.</p>

<p>In closing, I will raise one further issue concerning the Government’s approach to energy efficiency and the funding of measures to improve it. I would like Ministers to undertake a thorough review of the impediments to introducing innovative schemes that encourage home improvements. Just last week, I was alerted to how an innovative domestic solar panel installer’s business model is being constrained by provisions in the Consumer Credit Act 1974 designed to protect both consumers and suppliers from theft or loan default on portable consumer goods, such as cars. It seems problematic that those provisions should also apply to home insulation schemes, which are not portable—or, if they are, they are very expensive to move—and therefore are not a good asset on which to lend subject to those provisions. I strongly ask Ministers to examine such issues with some urgency. It may well be appropriate to do so when the UK Infrastructure Bank Bill comes to this House, to ensure that the bank is not similarly hobbled in making investments in energy efficiency projects. Thanks to the Department, those are one of its core remits.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I certainly shall wind up briefly. I will not take time congratulating hon. Members on their contributions to the debate, all of which exhibited consistency in recognising that while this country is a leader in responding to climate change, we have a great deal further to go. There is a broad understanding across the House, as was reflected in everyone’s contributions, that there is an opportunity before us, which is enhanced by the energy crisis and the changes to the energy markets in the last 12 months or so, and we need to grasp it. We need to add pace to the frameworks and the delivery of the strategies that the Minister ably evidenced.</p>

<p>I appreciate that we have been through a difficult period; the last two years of covid undoubtedly interrupted many plans that were in germination, and it has taken time to get them out, but now is the time. Last week’s report by the CCC, which several hon. Members referred to, made that crystal clear. I mention in particular the hon. Member for Bristol North West (Darren Jones), and the role that his Committee plays in holding the Department to account.</p>

<p>The time is now. We need to get on with these strategies. It may not be possible to do that in the next 24 hours or seven days, but certainly this year we must take greater strides in getting the plans out there, so that the industries that implement them—it will be mostly the private sector that does the heavy lifting—understand the environment in which they are delivering our net zero ambitions, which everybody across the House shares.</p>

<p>Last weekend, Labour made the exciting announcement that if it were to win the next General Election, it would aim to create a National Care Service in England, with just as much ambition as the 1945 government that brought in the NHS.</p>
<p>As the Shadow Minister for Public Health, I was naturally very pleased with this announcement. For far too long, social care has been allowed to flounder, leading to one in seven care homes no longer meeting standards and requiring improvement. This, coupled with catastrophic costs, means that people are no longer being able to access care when they need it.</p>
<p>A National Care Service would tackle that head-on. It would be a publicly owned, publicly funded and free at the point of use. I’m delighted that Labour have publicly committed to making this a reality and are working with the Fabian Society to flesh out the details.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, this is an incredibly ambitious commitment, and one that will most likely take more than one term in government to realise. The immediate priority of a Labour Government would be to provide better pay, training and rights for carers, whilst urgently improving care standards. But this would come alongside a longer-term vision to create a national care service on a par with Nye Bevan’s vision for the NHS.</p>
<p>This announcement is significant not only nationally, but also locally. Here in Tameside, we have the Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Trust, which means that Health and Adult Social Care is already heavily integrated. Through collaboration with local health and care partners, the Trust aims to give care within hospitals and the local community. This means better care for patients, and a more efficient service in the process. I’m proud to see Tameside leading the way on integrated care and am excited about what more they can achieve over the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>A National Care Service would perfectly align with the principles of integrated care here in Tameside. It would give communities the tools they need to improve the lives of local residents and has the potential to be truly transformative for the health of this nation.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a policy that demonstrates what an effective Labour Government would do. In 1945, Labour transformed our healthcare system, and improved the lives of millions. We stand ready and waiting to do the same again.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, the UK was quick off the mark with vaccines, and the UK Government played its part in that prompt response. A reaction that was possible in no small part due to the incredible work undertaken by the scientific community, particularly those who worked on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, along with Swedish partners.</p>



<h4 class="has-text-align-center">But, of course, that is only part of the story:</h4>



<p>Few of us will ever forget the Prime Minister&#8217;s own response to the initial surge in COVID cases. &#8220;let the bodies pile high&#8221; was his well-reported choice of words. Hardly the comfort people needed when their lives were at risk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Then came the lockdown-breaking parties that ended in UK lawmakers becoming lawbreakers.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When people needed to trust their Government most, they were treated to falsehoods repeatedly by the Prime Minister. His lies were perpetrated amid the worst health pandemic in living history – not something people can easily forget.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister and his Government asserted without any basis that they could only vaccinate the public because of Brexit. They claimed the big bad European Medicines Agency would have stopped them. It is still repeated, and it is still a whopper. Yet, back then, the UK was still transitioning from the EU and still subject to EU laws. The UK&#8217;s former&nbsp; Vaccine Task Force Head, Kate Bingham, said of the claims, &#8220;Any other country could have registered the vaccine under EU law -so that was nothing to do with Brexit.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The tories didn&#8217;t spin this line because they believed it to be true; they did it because it fitted their Brexit propaganda campaign.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It really does speak for itself that Ross thinks the UK response to a crisis that has left the public trust in tatters is his strongest defence of the union.</p>



<p>Douglas Ross also claimed that research indicated that if it were not part of the UK political union, Scotland would have missed out on over a million vaccinations. It is quite a statement to make, given the impact damaging public trust had on the vaccination programme.</p>



<p>It also begs the question of how several small independent countries have successfully vaccinated their populations – and what would have made Scotland different?</p>



<p>Malta, for instance, has vaccinated more people per 100 of the population than the UK. In fact, CNN has an excellent vaccine tracker showing the UK behind many nations, including independent countries of Cuba, Singapore, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, and Finland. Some are in the EU, and some are not, but all have delivered more arms shots by their populations&#8217; measures.</p>



<p>So, again, why would Scotland be the only small independent country that wouldn&#8217;t have been able to vaccinate its population?</p>



<p>Ross and his colleagues love to talk up the &#8220;broad shoulders&#8221; of UK Government financial support. It&#8217;s as if no other country, large or small, took action to protect its citizen&#8217;s livelihoods.</p>



<p>During lockdown in 2020, Columbia University looked at the support nations were giving to their people. It is striking that, again, independent Malta was at the top of the list, providing 25% of GDP to its people, compared to the UK&#8217;s 5%. The UK came 47<sup>th</sup> by the measures used. Factoring in banking support pushed it up the rankings, but much of that funding never reached the people who needed it. In France, 100% of wages were paid to those on low pay, and in the Netherlands, 90%.</p>



<p>Every Government with fiscal control has the power to help the people they serve.</p>



<p>It never adds up, as to why Ross and his colleagues believe Scotland would be the only country not able to do this.</p>



<p>While on fiscal responsibility, remember the dodgy procurement processes, the cronyism, and the wasted millions spent by awarding contracts to their buddies. There was the damning report by the Westminster committee on the PPE procurement shambles and the 10s of billions of pounds wasted on test and trace measures never used or the &#8220;eye watering sums spent on overpriced consultants.&#8221;</p>



<p>Douglas Ross may want to wear his rose-tinted glasses when looking at the UK&#8217;s response to the pandemic, but the rest of us live in reality.</p>



<p>That he thinks these are his strongest arguments for the UK union says a lot about the lack of benefits of this outdated political union. If this is their best reason to stay, roll on the day when we have the power to build a fairer, more prosperous Scotland.</p>

			<p>The deaths of vulnerable disabled social security claimants are, in my view, a damning indictment on successive Governments.</p>
<p>If the key purpose of all Governments is to keep its citizens safe, one has to ask why have they failed so miserably to protect some of the most vulnerable citizens in the UK?</p>
<p>We know that these deaths are happening: between July 2019 and March 2022 official data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that they have investigated 123 deaths and 34 cases of serious harm through their so-called Internal Process Review.</p>
<p>But the <em>actual</em> scale of deaths is believed to be much more, and the <em>causes</em> of these deaths has yet to be investigated.</p>
<p>There are glimpses that we are seeing just the tip of the iceberg from these official figures: former MP Madeleine Moon’s written question to the DWP revealing that 60 people a month who are refused Personal Independence Payment die within 3 months; another found that 274 people die each month after being found fit for work within 6 months; the National Audit Office’s report on claimant suicides in 2020; Professor Ben Barr’s academic report on 600 suicides being associated with the Work Capability Assessment between 2010 and 2013; the BBC’s Alex Homer’s investigation and more. Now this report, Death by Welfare, which looks at the impact of successive welfare reform on these deaths adds to this and compliments the two reports on the impacts of the 2016 Welfare Reform Act on the health of children and disabled people published by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Health in All Policies.</p>
<p>The serial obfuscation and even cover up by this Government has made this worse. The refusal to allow the Work and Pensions Select Committee &#8211; whose job is to hold the Government to account on social security issues &#8211; to see the reports into these deaths. ‘Destroying’ peer review reports (the IPR predecessor) before 2016. The failure to give these peer review reports into social security deaths to the reviewers of the Work Capability Assessment ‘because they didn’t ask for them’! See my Urgent Questions on this in 2019.</p>
<p>I don’t want any more families like Pip Day’s, Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s, David Clapson’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have. The current Work and Pensions Secretary has even said she doesn’t have a duty of care to safeguard vulnerable claimants, and for me that says it all. This social security system needs a root and branch reform.</p>
<p>I’ve been calling for a public inquiry to investigate the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date. Despite all of this, the Government has refused to listen. Help us get justice for them. Add your voice to the call for a public inquiry.</p>

<p>Pelsall Carnival was back after 2 years and what a good event it was. Even the showers of rain didn’t dampen the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was an honour to be asked to take part in the Carnival Queen Crowning ceremony and presentations.</p>
<p>With so many stalls, displays, and local groups and organisations taking part, there was lots to see and do again this year.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for me is always the Procession and the fantastic floats and we were not disappointed. The jubilee was a popular theme, and ‘Best of Britain’ was a particular favourite of mine – complete with Paddington Bear!</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for a lovely day.</p>

concern about the chosen sites, all west of St. Clears, and what this will mean
for residents of the Llanelli constituency, particularly in terms of transport
links. </p>



<p>Lee Waters MS said:</p>



<p>“So much needs to be considered still for this new
hospital.”</p>



<p>“I am concerned that these proposed sites are in
out-of-town locations and will be around a one-hour drive for most people in
and around Llanelli. Given that 20% of households do not own a car, it is
essential that a site with very good public transport links is chosen.”</p>



<p>“Prince Phillip Hospital, in Hywel Dda’s largest town,
should be maximised for planned operations. I would also like to see the nurse
led maternity unit that was proposed there in the consultation.”</p>



<p>This week, people from communities across
Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire helped the Health Board to score
the five potential sites for a new hospital in a zone between Narberth and St
Clears. </p>



<p>The workshop on Tuesday 28 June was the second of two
technical sessions with members of the public, staff and partners. Those
present will score the potential five sites, seven technical criteria to be
used in this scoring process. </p>



<p>Dame Nia Griffith MP commented:</p>



<p>“It is absolutely vital that we have in Prince Philip
Hospital as many services&nbsp;as possible, including a wide range of
outpatient appointments so that patients do not have to travel when the clinics
could be held locally in Llanelli, And I’d also like to see the nurse-led
maternity unit as proposed in the consultation.”</p>



<p>“We would be so much nearer Swansea hospitals than to the
new proposed sites, that we also need robust agreements with the Swansea Health
Board for Llanelli patients to be taken there for emergency and other
treatment.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Health Board has stated that all sites are in a zone
that is the most central location for the majority of the population in the
south of the Hywel Dda area and was determined through public consultation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government’s Northern Ireland Protocol Bill started its journey through Parliament this week. This Bill has been widely condemned as it will see the UK stepping back from international law to break commitments made with our global partners. This is a dangerous game being played by the UK Government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key part of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, which no one seems to want to mention but which has always been important for bringing peace and stability across communities, is the mutual interest and mutual respect between the UK and Irish Governments for the communities that exist in Northern Ireland. It is our duty to find a path through that avoids stagnation, indecision and fighting in the courts. We cannot afford to frighten off investment that is crucial for prosperity and security. Instead, we must choose investment that brings prosperity and keeps the peace in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a big week for the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee this week as we heard from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head of the Home Civil Service,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Case. This is the very same Civil Servant who had to recuse themselves from investigating lockdown breaking parties in Downing Street because he attended them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I have been to Downing Street and it is really not that big. I find it incredibly difficult to believe that those working in Downing Street during the pandemic and during the lockdowns were unaware of what was happening. What was worrying about Simon Case’s answers to questions was how much he copied the Prime Minister’s style.  While he said that they were investigating how to make it easier for staff to come forward with any complaints, I am concerned that some staff felt that it was perfectly acceptable to bring alcohol into the workplace and to break all the significant laws the Government had imposed on the rest of the country. It suggests to me that there was a complete failure of leadership within both the Government and the Civil Service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am quite frankly fed up of the excuses of the pandemic being an intense period of work and it being a stressful period for those working in Downing Street. It appears to me to treat our key workers with such contempt as if the doctors and nurses working in incredible uncomfortable, and at times, painful PPE, treating the sick and the dying, were not in incredibly intense and stressful workplaces themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs Wade, an Urgent Question was held in the House of Commons on the importance of women’s reproductive rights. I was dismayed by the attack on women’s rights by the US Supreme Court, especially as it defends the rights to freedom in so many other aspects. A woman’s right to choose does not force beliefs on others. Many women on the Labour Benches have worked with our sister parties across the world for many years to advance women’s reproductive rights, because they are fundamental to our economic rights. The £1.9 billion-worth of cuts to women’s aid programmes around the world do indicate the Government’s approach to those rights and to women’s programmes, so I asked the Minister to seriously urge her colleagues to look again at those cuts. This is a globally financed attack on women’s rights, and we need to respond in kind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to support the Reading Agency’s Summer Reading Challenge at their event in Parliament. This year the Summer Reading Challenge is partnering with the Science Museum Group to launch ‘Gadgeteers’, a science and innovation-themed challenge. The Summer Reading Challenge aims to encourage 4-11-year-olds to set a reading challenge for themselves and is funded by the Arts Council England. The Challenge will launch in England on Saturday 9 July. Visit </span><a href="https://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a profile, find book recommendations, play games, and to find out about local libraries participating in the challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to meet with representatives for Rights For Residents to discuss their campaign to end the current restrictions around visiting loves ones in care homes. The lockdowns caused by the Covid pandemic were an incredibly difficult time for everyone, with children out of school, families and friends separated, and increased anxiety over work. However, there are still restrictions in place in some care homes. Rights For Residents told me about the residents who have told their families that they would rather die than continue merely existing in isolation, the residents who are then plagued with guilt for appearing to abandon loved ones who may not understand why they are no longer receiving visits. The campaign wants the Government to enshrine in law the right for residents of care home to have a nominated Essential Visitor so that residents of care homes are not isolated from the visits that are so important to them.</span></p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my June email newsletter. Opening with the marvellous Platinum Jubilee celebrations and closing with some of the largest rail strikes in a generation, this has once again been an eventful month for Amber Valley. And as the country and our locality faces many challenges as we move forward, I want to better understand your thoughts and feelings about the most pressing of these issues. To this end, my Annual Residents Survey is now live and can be found below.</p>



<p>You will also find updates on: the ongoing bid for ownership of Derby County Football Club, the local rollout of the £150 energy payment to help people with their bills, this month’s rail strikes, my work as chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Pensions, and NHS waiting times in our constituency.</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Residents&#8217; Summer Survey</u></strong></p>



<p>I am pleased to announce that this year’s Amber Valley Summer Survey is now live. This is where you can express how you feel about the most important issues facing our constituency and nation.</p>



<p>The survey takes around 5 minutes to complete and is immensely useful for me to understand your thoughts on present day issues. Surveys like this one help inform my decisions on how best to represent you in parliament, how to vote on important legislation, and what local issues I should focus on within the constituency.</p>



<p>We have had fantastic results from our previous surveys so I am hoping the residents of Amber Valley can outdo themselves once again. You can find the survey using the link below:</p>



<p><a href="https://nigelmillsmp.com/residents-survey-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here to complete the Residents Survey</a></p>



<p><strong><u>Derby County Football Club</u></strong></p>



<p>I am happy to update constituents that Derby County Football Club looks set to exit administration soon. As many of you will already know, Clowes Developments LTD have this month acquired Pride Park stadium and have submitted a formal bid for ownership of the club. This is truly excellent news as the acquisition of Pride Park stadium has been a significant challenge in relation to the sale of the club.</p>



<p>If someone had told me 30 years ago, when I watched Notts County cruelly deprived of a championship play-off place, that I would have some role to play in trying to save Derby County, I might have expressed some doubt. But it is at this sort of time that the football family comes together. The only reason we have rivalries is because our rivals stay in existence; no one wants to see any club go out of business, least of all a club with the size and history of Derby County.</p>



<p>Alongside a number of other local MPs from across the political spectrum, I have been engaging with stakeholders, the club’s joint administrators Quantuma, and the EFL on a regular basis. I have also attended a number of debates in Westminster on this matter, and at times the club’s future has seemed uncertain. I am therefore, especially pleased that a deal has been reached, and the future of the club looks more assured.</p>



<p><strong><u>The local rollout of the £150 Council Tax rebate</u></strong></p>



<p>Last month, I welcomed the Government’s announcement of further measures to help households with the rising cost of living and higher levels of inflation; caused largely by the fallout from the pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine. As part of this support, the Government pledged to give households in council tax bands A to D a £150 energy payment through a council tax rebate.</p>



<p>The council tax rebate is being rolled out by local authorities, and households in Amber Valley who pay their council tax by direct debit will have already received the £150 payment directly into their bank accounts, a number of weeks ago. However, as many of you will be aware, the payment to those in Amber Valley who do not have a direct debit set up with the council was delayed by a number of weeks.</p>



<p>The explanation Amber Valley Borough Council (AVBC) gave for the delay was that the council had to acquire new software so that bank accounts for those not on direct debit could be validated to prevent fraudulent claims. On the &nbsp;22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;June I spoke about the local ramifications of this delay in the House of Commons, and throughout the month I have been engaging with AVBC and colleagues in Westminster in an attempt to expedite the rollout of this support.</p>



<p>I am happy to update residents that the application form for the £150 energy rebate for those who do not pay by direct debit, is now live. You can find the form online&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/benefits/150-energy-bills-rebate-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></p>



<p>Alternatively, if you are not able to access the website or do not feel confident to complete the form online then AVBC’s Customer Services are available to assist you. Please use the following number: 01773 570222. You are also able to go directly to the council building in Ripley with your Council tax bill and bank account details to complete the process in person.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Platinum Jubilee celebrations</u></strong></p>



<p>It was wonderful to see so many of you turn out to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations at the beginning of this month. Amber Valley put on a fantastic show for the occasion, with events held across the constituency. I know many of you will have attended the tea parties, lighting of beacons, and late-night festivities that make occasions like this so special.</p>



<p>It was an occasion to take pride and give our thanks to The Queen for her exemplary service over the past 70 years. All of it dedicated to the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.</p>



<p>We have been extremely lucky to have The Queen as our head of state for so long, bringing stability through a time of tremendous change.</p>



<p><strong><u>NHS waiting lists&nbsp;</u></strong></p>



<p>The Government is making good progress in reducing the number of NHS patients waiting the longest for treatment. At the national level, the number of patients who have waited over 2 years to receive treatment has fallen from 22,500 in January to 6,700. I completely support the Government’s efforts, and have been in regular contact with our local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to assess the scale of the challenge and the progress that is being made.</p>



<p>The pandemic had a tremendous impact on patient waiting times across our area, but thanks to the inspiring efforts of NHS staff and increased financial support from the Government, the backlog is now being reduced. In Derbyshire, the first week of January 2022 saw a total of 454 people who were registered as waiting longer than 2 years for treatment. However, as of 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June there were only 161 patients waiting longer than 104 weeks for treatment.</p>



<p>Derby and Derbyshire CCG have told me in recent days that they are making good progress towards their target of ensuring no patient will be waiting more than two years for treatment by the end of this month. I will continue to engage with the local CCG as well as my colleagues in Westminster as we continue to work towards improving patient outcomes and reducing backlogs and waiting times. I hope to be able to update residents with more good news that shows we’re heading in the right direction soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Rail strikes</u></strong></p>



<p>I know many of you were affected by travel disruption this month as the rail unions organised a week of strikes designed to bring large parts of the country’s rail network to a halt. Strike action took place on Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup>, Thursday 23<sup>rd</sup>, and Saturday 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June, however, due to the way the unions organised the strikes, we witnessed significant knock-on-delays and cancellations on all the remaining days of that week.</p>



<p>In Amber Valley, the strikes affected services from all our rail stations &#8211; Ambergate, Langley Mill, and Alfreton. With CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, and Northern services suffering major disruption and issuing statements warning customers to only travel if absolutely necessary.</p>



<p>My view is that these strikes are wrong. The unions have harmed countless individuals up and down the county &#8211; preventing scheduled NHS operations and treatment, disrupting students’ GCSE exams, and preventing people from attending important personal events like weddings and funerals. This is all in addition to forcing ordinary people to pay more to get into and out of work, if they can get into work at all – hitting millions of families in the pocket.</p>



<p>I do not believe it is fair to single out already well-paid rail workers for a substantial pay increase over and above the rest of the workforce in both the public and private sectors at this time of high global inflation. Especially when these pay increases to rail staff would have to come from either higher rail ticket prices, or the taxpayer. For the sake of ordinary working families, I hope a sensible resolution to this dispute can be found soon.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Labour frontbench continue to refuse to condemn these strikes. With a number of Labour MPs actually attending picket lines, adding to the disruption. I believe it is relevant to include here that the RMT union, who organised these strikes, have donated almost £250,000 to the Labour Party and local branches in the last decade. And five Labour MPs who have supported the strikes have received a total of £20,000 in donations from the RMT union.</p>



<p><strong><u>Pensions dashboard: a revolution in how we plan for retirement</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June, as part of my role as chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Pensions, I hosted the group’s Annual General Meeting alongside a discussion on the future of pensions dashboards. These dashboards could revolutionise how we plan for retirement and interact with our pensions.</p>



<p>Pensions dashboards will enable people to access all of their pensions information easily, securely, in one place online. Dashboards will provide clear and simple information about all the pensions a person has accumulated over their lifetime, including any workplace pensions and their State Pension. The aim is to create an information board where people can easily see the combined value of all their pensions, as well as a host of other personal pensions information, all in one place. Enabling better, more informed, retirement planning.</p>



<p>At the meeting we discussed concerns people might have regarding pensions dashboards, and I was reassured to learn of the privacy, security, and personalisation being built into these systems. For example, these systems will not allow anyone to move or interfere with their pensions accidently or deliberately in any way, they are simply designed to display an individual’s pensions information so they can better understand how much pension savings they have, and where is currently kept.</p>



<p>The Government has committed to work with the pensions industry to develop these dashboards, a move which I wholeheartedly welcome. I will continue engaging with the pensions industry and my ministerial colleagues on this matter as these pensions dashboards become available.</p>



<p><strong>Street Watch &#8211; report it:</strong></p>

<p>These are dark times when many question if our country has lost its way. I regularly hear from those who worry about the divisive nature of some policies and speculate on whether values such as decency, honesty and integrity are under attack.</p>



<p>Two events I took part in last week have given me a more optimistic view.</p>



<p>I was able to deliver cakes donated by constituents to care homes on Friday and Saturday as part of an initiative developed during the pandemic which builds on the Great Get-Together.</p>



<p>The Get-Together results from the murder of my former colleague Jo Cox, and the wish to remember her by focusing on gatherings which encourage people to come together for picnics and small social events. It emanates from her famous dictum that we have more in common than that which divides us.</p>



<p>We couldn&#8217;t hold these gatherings during the pandemic and instead opted for an appeal for cakes for care homes. We&#8217;ve continued with that because of its simplicity which evokes the generosity for which Jo was famed. It&#8217;s just about showing a little kindness to others.</p>



<p>On Monday we were able to resume, after a two-year absence caused by the pandemic, our annual Veterans Day event at Swanshurst School. This is an opportunity to bring together those who&#8217;ve protected our country and its values, over the years, and to thank them for their contribution.</p>



<p>It involves a short veteran&#8217;s parade, a light lunch, some entertainment and an opportunity for a new generation of schoolgirls to learn from the experience of their elders. It&#8217;s all organised and delivered by volunteers.</p>



<p>Jo Cox Get-Togethers, cakes for care homes and veterans&#8217; events won&#8217;t change our country or the behaviour of those hell bent on division but they&#8217;re evidence of the basic decency of people and their desire to help and support others. They&#8217;re a reminder of real British values which endure even during dark periods. The kindness of ordinary people and their generous contributions give us all hope.</p>

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has warmly welcomed the statement from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday proposing a Referendum on Scottish Independence in October 2023.</p>



<p>The First Minister says there is an “indisputable” mandate for another vote after a majority of independence-supporting MSPs were returned in last year’s Holyrood elections.</p>



<p>Nicola Sturgeon has proposed October 19, 2023, as the date for the referendum and has confirmed this would use the same question as in 2014 &#8211; Should Scotland be an independent country?</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “Scotland has a fantastic chance now to leave the madhouse that is Boris’s UK. Things are getting worse for Brexit UK all the time and when we compare Scotland with comparative countries, we see that these independent comparative countries have greater fairness; greater social mobility; less gaps between rich and poor; and generally, a better standard of living for their citizens. In Scotland we are no worse than these countries and in fact we have a lot of natural resources physical and of course in the minds of our people as one of the most educated populations in Europe.</p>



<p>“We have nothing to fear but fear itself and anybody making a rational decision would make the decision for independence. It is time to act rationally for yourselves, your communities and for your descendants.”</p>

<p>My week in Westminster began when I joined the M&amp;S and Prince’s Trust reception to celebrate the milestone of 10,000 young people completing the Marks and Start employability scheme. M&amp;S is the Prince’s Trust largest partner, and since 2014 many 16-30 year olds have taken part in 4 week placement programmes to gain practical experience and skills whilst working alongside a buddy in an M&amp;S store. People who successfully complete the placement are offered a 16 hour fixed-term contract and 81% go on to continue working permanently for M&amp;S. I met wonderful young Neath Store Manager Darcie Price, who had been through the programme, and we spoke about how important the store is to Neath – the retail service it supplies and the job opportunities it provides to the people of the Neath constituency.</p>
<p>At my next event, I met Sir Bill Beaumont and former England RWC winner Will Greenwood at the Aramis Rugby and World Rugby World Cup Official Supporter of France 2023 reception and panel session. We spoke about the great Phil Bennett, who had very sadly passed away that morning, and the legacy that he has left to rugby, and to the people of Wales.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, I joined the Llafur100 Reception to celebrate the centenary of the Labour Party winning the popular vote in Wales for the first time in 1922, and which the Labour Party in Wales has achieved in every general election since. Speakers included Mark Drakeford MS, First Minister of Wales; Sir Keir Starmer MP, Labour Party Leader; Jo Stevens MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Wales; Wayne David MP, Caerphilly; and Baroness Eluned Morgan MS, Welsh Government Health and Social Services Minister, who is leading the Llafur100 programme. The reception was chaired by Carolyn Harris MP for Swansea East and Deputy Leader of Welsh Labour. Mark Drakeford spoke about the iconic life of Jim Griffiths, former MP Llanelli, and that there has only been 4 MPs for Llanelli since 1922: John Williams 1922-36; Jim Griffiths 1936-70; Denzil Davies 1970-2005; and current MP Dame Nia Griffith, who has held Llanelli for Labour since 2005.</p>
<p>The business in the Chamber was the Report Stage of the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill. I voted on New Clause 4 which would ensure that the Director of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom has not, and cannot whilst in office, donate to a political party and ensure they are only appointed subject to confirmation of an independent advisory panel, the Select Committee of the House of Commons, and a resolution of each House of Parliament. Labour lost by 150 to 282 votes. I voted on Amendment 17 which would ensure that other competing freedoms as found in the Equality Act, the Counter-Terrorism Act and the Security Act 2015 are considered in relation to complaints lodged under the Free Speech Complaints Scheme. Labour lost by 152 to 284 votes.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, I chaired the Committee Stage of the Online Safety Bill Line by Line scrutiny session. The opposition parties have tabled hundreds of amendments. The Committee Stage started on May 24th and we will be in committee until the end of June.</p>
<p>At lunchtime I attended the private meeting of the Petitions Committee in which members considered petitions that had attained over 100,000 signatures, Government responses, and planned future petition debates.</p>
<p>Then I rushed to Chair the Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee which considered the Draft Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) and Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution) (Law of the Sea Convention) Amendment Order 2022. The UK Government Minister said that this Statutory Instrument (SI) performs a purely technical function of amending how the International Convention on Standards Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (1995) is transposed into UK Law. It is being considered under the Draft Affirmative procedure and will not come into effect if not approved by Parliament. This SI would extend regulations on marine pollution and the crewing of vessels that currently applies to ships so that they also cover hovercrafts. The SI would also authorise the UK Government to make further regulations punishing pollution from vessels with imprisonment of no more that 2 years instead of, or as well as, a fine. The Government requires this power to implement the Convention and to replace the Merchant Shipping (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) Regulations 2015. There was a lively debate about hovercrafts and I learnt that there’s only one hovercraft service remaining in the UK – from Southsea, Portsmouth to Ryde, Isle of Wight. There was cross party support for the SI and it passed without a division.</p>
<p>Then I attended the Colour-Blindness Awareness session, where I tried on simulation glasses through which I viewed a pie chart, which had been simulated to replicate severe colour vision. I discovered that I am not colour blind. I learned about the many everyday challenges faced by the one in twelve men and the one in two hundred women that suffer with colour-blindness in the UK, that’s three million citizens. I pledged my support to people and to my constituents who suffer with this challenging condition.</p>
<p>I then voted on our Official Labour Opposition Day debates. The first debate was a censure motion against the Minister for Future Borders and Immigration for his handling of the crisis at Her Majesty’s Passport Office, which directed him to come to the House no later than 20th June to apologise to the tens of thousands of people who have waited more than 6 weeks for their passport. Unfortunately, Labour lost by 198 to 295 votes. The second debate called on the UK Government to reverse its decision to sell Channel 4, as it will undermine the UK’s world leading creative industries and the delicate ecosystem of companies that support them. After a long debate where there was cross party support, the question was put and resolved.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning I attended the Western Gateway All Party Parliamentary Group APPG and we listened to Professor Mark Barry speak about the importance of connectivity throughout the region and Wales. Mark emphasised the importance of public transport to the creation of jobs and skills, and I spoke about the Global Centre of Rail Excellence which is being developed in Onllwyn.</p>
<p>Then we dashed across to College Green for a photo and media session with stakeholders who have pledged to be partners in Western Gateway projects.</p>
<p>The Chamber business began with oral questions to the President of COP, followed by PMQs, and I spent the rest of the afternoon, patiently waiting with the other 19 MPs who have been fortunate to be drawn in the top 20 of the Private Members’ Bill Ballot to be called into the Chamber to present our PMBs and to specify a Sitting Friday date when our Bills will be debated. I chose the first Sitting Friday, 15th July 2022, and will be trying my best to persuade MPs and more importantly the UK Government to back my PMB to ban the import and export of shark fins into the UK.</p>
<p>The debate in the Chamber was a Government debate about Rail Strikes. I voted for Labour amendment (a) which stated that we did not want the rail strikes to go ahead, and therefore urgently called upon the Government, operators, network rail and the union to get around the table and resolve the issues on pay and cuts to safety staff to avert industrial action. Labour lost by 174 to 286 votes.</p>
<p>Back in Neath I visited Dwr-y-Felin school where I met the headteacher Penny Peet and pupils from years 7,8,9 for a Q&amp;A session. We spoke about many topics including, Parliament, local government, social media, sport, arts, culture, and future careers. Every question I was asked was thought provoking and I really enjoyed meeting our stars of the future. I offered to host the pupils in Westminster and Ms Peet has promised to plan a visit to the House of Commons in the near future.</p>

<p>This morning we were notified by government that they are minded to appoint 
commissioners to oversee some parts of the City Council. The appointment of 
commissioners would be unjustified, and an attack on our local democracy. Under 
new leadership, Nottingham Labour have been making progress, being open about 
the difficulties we face and working hard to put things right. We have worked with the 
government appointed Improvement and Assurance Board to address all their 
concerns and they have reported positively to Government about our progress.</p>



<p>This work has resulted in the reduction in council debt, a transformation plan that will 
save the council £45m and improve services for Nottingham people. We have set a 
four year balanced budget, and have changed the culture and governance so that 
issues like the HRA are uncovered, shared transparently and sorted. The Council 
under the current leadership has made significant changes to the way it works, is 
open about the issues we face and is determined to get things right and this has 
been recognised by the Improvement and Assurance Board.</p>



<p>The Improvement and Assurance Board, headed by Sir Tony Redmond &#8211; the former 
Local Government Ombudsman &#8211; have described our progress positively to 
government and reported on our determination to succeed, so we are asking 
government what additional change they expect to achieve by bringing in people 
who know nothing of the City and our residents’ needs. Although we oppose the 
Governments’ intention to appoint commissioners the continuity provided by Sir Tony 
Redmond provides some assurance that our previous improvements are understood 
and can be built on.</p>



<p>But, we are asking what new actions would happen as a result of 
commissioners coming in that would improve the working of this council, or 
result in any changes that Nottingham people would want. We will use our 
opportunity to respond to this proposal from Government to ask these 
questions.</p>



<p>If it is the case that the government does take this action, this will be based 
not on what is best for the city, but what is best for the Conservative Party.</p>



<p>We will of course work positively and openly with commissioners, as we have with 
the Improvement and Assurance Board in the best interests of our city, but we will be 
straight with them, and straight with Nottingham people and will continue to fight for 
what Nottingham people need and have elected a Labour council to do.</p>



<p>The government cuts to our budgets means that it is more difficult to do everything 
we want to do to help our communities at this time but we have been fighting for 
Nottingham and protecting our services against the worst effects of Tory cuts. We 
made sure that Nottingham City Council &#8211; and our amazing staff &#8211; were there for you 
during the Covid crisis and we fought hard to get what we needed for our city to help 
keep people safe.</p>



<p>After more than a decade of Tory austerity &#8211; and the pandemic &#8211; we have managed  to set a four year balanced budget. This has not been easy, but Nottingham Labour:                                                                     Has retained 75 community protection officers                                                                                                     Are still building council houses and have improved private rented housing  through our licensing scheme                                                                                                                                                                        Has kept ownership of our outstanding care homes                                                                                                    Is still running six leisure centres                                                                                                                                 Is supporting Welfare Rights advice services across the city because we  defend what is needed by Nottingham people.</p>



<p>We are still supporting free events for families all year round, and you can still expect 
a regular bus service to get you there from our award winning city owned bus 
company. We have our own bus company because Labour protected it, when many 
others were sold off to private operators and they are now seeing more cancelled 
services and far higher fares. We invested in a tram that brings good jobs to the city 
and gets people to them. Our great public transport system has contributed to 
cleaner air than other cities in the UK and made people less reliant on a car.</p>



<p>The transformation of the Broadmarsh is underway after the shopping centre 
operator went into administration, a new central library will soon be fitted out, a green 
space in the heart of our city will be created and new developments creating jobs 
and homes will be coming in the next few years.</p>



<p>We are a city of hardworking people and Nottingham deserves better than 
intervention from an out of touch Tory government that is more concerned with 
protecting the profits of the energy companies than the people who can’t heat their 
homes or struggle to feed their families. We understand what twelve years of Tory 
austerity and now the cost of living crisis means to you, because we do not just 
represent our communities, we are part of them. We will carry on fighting for what 
Nottingham needs and will still be ready to help with the problems you are facing, or 
hear your views and hopes for the city.</p>

<p>The moment it was announced that Bradford had won the City of Culture 2025 title is a moment I will never forget. The crowds gathered in City Park erupted in cheers and applause at the sheer joy and immense pride of winning the title. I have said it many times in the past three weeks but it deserves to be said again: Congratulations Bradford!</p>



<p>And while we are sure to enjoy all sorts of exciting cultural events across Bradford District during our year with the crown, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The City of Culture title is not just twelve months for Bradford to shine in the national limelight. It is a transformative opportunity for the city to unlock its potential and make sure Bradford’s light keeps burning brightly for years to come.</p>



<p>Previous title winners have seen tens of millions of pounds of long-term investment – and there is no reason why Bradford can’t do better. Bradford is the youngest, most entrepreneurial city in the country and study after study has shown it is the city with most to gain from levelling up and investment. Our City of Culture win is an unmissable opportunity to leverage investment, funding and ideas into the city. It is about raising Bradford’s profile and making the case that we are open for business. It is a chance to showcase Bradford businesses to the world and to show that if you’re a company, then Bradford is a thriving place to come and do businesses too.</p>



<p>But to make the most of this springboard opportunity, families and businesses need support with the day-to-day struggle of making ends meet right now. I know times continue to be hard today but, what is worse, is that the country is on track to face an even harsher energy and cost of living crisis this winter.</p>



<p>In January, Labour proposed a one-off windfall tax on North Sea oil and other gas producers who are raking in obscene profits while ordinary people struggle, as a way to fund help with soaring energy costs. It took five months for the Government to finally accept that this was the right thing to do.</p>



<p>From January to May, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak left families, older people and those already pushed to breaking point worried, panicking and stuck because the Government failed to act.</p>



<p>I have long been calling on the Government to take action. In September 2021, I raised my concerns regarding our dwindling natural gas reserves directly with the Business Secretary and challenged the Government’s decision to stop investing in gas storage. I was met with meaningless rhetoric about future energy diversification and no plan – right before an energy crisis caused by a surge in wholesale gas prices. Then in May this year, we heard how the UK had a huge surplus of gas &#8211; but that we had nowhere to store it, while announcements were made that as many as six million households could face power cuts because of gas shortages.</p>



<p>And it’s not just people here that are being hit by the cost of energy; it is affecting local businesses too. Some are facing astronomical energy bills as the energy price cap does not apply to businesses. I visited one energy-intensive manufacturer recently who told me their energy bills have skyrocketed from £7 million to £35 million a year. When I asked the Business and Energy Minister what plans the Government had to support businesses like this, the Minister simply dismissed this as an ‘extreme case’ – yet I am hearing that this is the story up and down the country. The government needs to listen to businesses and step in to help them.</p>



<p>This is important. Bradford’s manufacturing industry is part of the city’s heritage. Over 24,000 people in the city work in manufacturing, making it the fourth biggest city for manufacturing in the country. Energy intensive industries across the UK like steel, food production, basic chemicals and building materials are essential to our everyday lives. Hardworking workers plough in hour after hour to keep these industries going. How can we expect to be able to showcase the best of Bradford when rising energy costs means businesses and residents alike are fighting to keep their heads above the water?</p>



<p>To make the most of its City of Culture win, Bradford needs its residents and businesses to be thriving. We need the national Government to get the basics right on this: Act now to properly support businesses, not six months down the line when it reaches another crisis point.</p>



<p>Bradford is ready to build a City of Culture legacy that will last for decades to come, and I call for the Government to get on board with us too.</p>

<p>After a three year covid related absence the Hannington Country Fair returned this last weekend, with huge crowds arriving in this tiny Hampshire village. With it&#8217;s usual one way system in place, the fair was a lovely way to spend an afternoon with the kids, and see some old friends. I even released a dove in support of the local hospice!</p>

<p>Yesterday 40 years ago, General Moore, reported to the Commander-in-Chief, “The Falkland Islands are once more under the Government desired by their inhabitants. God Save the Queen.” A fitting service in St Margaret’s Church to remember those who helped liberate the islands.</p>

<p>I am writing with a further update on a couple of local matters.</p>
<p>Firstly can I start by thanking everyone who was involved in organising all the Platinum Jubilee Events locally. We had a really wide range of things going on over the weekend, and I know it all took a huge amount of effort. Thank you.</p>
<h2>TFL Clean Air Consultation</h2>
<p>Those who live at the north end of Epsom and Ewell and in Nork are probably particularly aware of the Mayor of London’s plans to extend the Ultra Low Emission zone to the London boundary. This would mean that older vehicles would have to pay a daily charge to drive across the boundary.</p>
<p>Clearly this has major implications for many people living locally, and while I understand the intent behind the policy, it is in my view damaging and unworkable for the areas immediately adjoining the boundary. Transport for London have yet to give clear details about how it would work on the border – for example what do they plan to do with cases like that of Sparrow Farm Road in Stoneleigh,  which is in Surrey on one side and in London on the other. But it would mean a charge for many Surrey residents doing local journeys or driving from one place in Surrey to another if the route crossed the boundary.</p>
<p>I have lodged an objection to the scheme because of this, and would encourage residents here to make their views known to TfL before the consultation ends. You can do so via this link</p>
<p><a href="https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/cleanair">https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/cleanair</a></p>
<p>Please do take part.</p>
<h2>Supporting Ukraine</h2>
<p>Thank you also to all of those who are helping Ukrainian refugees locally.</p>
<p>Over 70 Ukrainian families have arrived in the area and are being hosted by sponsor families.    If you are hosting and need some help, please reach out to Epsom &amp; Ewell Refugee Network who can offer support and advise to you and your guests.   They have a help desk each Monday at the Surrey Stands with Ukraine unit in the Ashley Centre 0930 &#8211; 1430.</p>
<p>The Network are holding a free Summer Language School to offer intensive English classes to refugees over the summer holidays.  If you want more information, you can find out more on their website (see link below).</p>

<p>If you are a teacher and can offer any help over the summer, please get in touch with them at <a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com">epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Many Ukrainians are now finding work and looking to rent a property.   If you are a local landlord and want to find out more about renting your property to a Ukrainian family, please get in touch with Epsom &amp; Ewell Refugee Network to find out more about how all of this works and how your rent is paid.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hub in the Ashley Centre continues to collect supplies to send to Ukraine, including tins of food for areas where supplies are short. I know that they would welcome any extra support.</p>

              <h3>Luciana Berger (Liverpool, Wavertree)</h3>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

<p>[Check against delivery]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to speak here this evening, on my home turf.</p>
<p>Now, before I begin, I understand there’s a sweepstake on the length of my remarks.</p>
<p>Let me just put everyone’s mind at rest… my money went on 82 minutes – so settle in folks!</p>
<p>Turning to what this evening is all about… Councillor Tattersall – our new Mayor – congratulations!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Mayor, you will be an outstanding Mayor for our borough. You are a tremendous councillor and a force of nature!</p>
<p>I know you have big plans for your term.</p>
<p>Your theme – Educate, inspire and deliver and your charities typify you…</p>
<p>Romero Communities – a wonderful organisation, who have provided invaluable support to countless people in Barnsley.</p>
<p>And one of the friendliest places to get a brew in the borough!</p>
<p>And Hey! – who do so much for our children and young people suffering with their mental health by providing the care they need when they need it most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The very first time I met Sarah was back in 2011. I was dashing about canvassing for Party members’ support ahead of the selection hustings for the forthcoming by-election.</p>
<p>I knocked on her door.</p>
<p>She kindly invited me in.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>I obviously wanted to take Sarah up on her offer – her endorsement would’ve been very useful, but it suddenly dawned on me this encounter was laden with risk.</p>
<p>The dilemma was such: coming in for a chat, meant taking off my shoes which in turn meant – to my great embarrassment – revealing a hole in my sock.</p>
<p>“Shall I take my shoes off” I said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can just leave them at the door” was the reply.</p>
<p>“Oh dear” I thought – it was actually another 4-letter word, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>I saw coming clean as the best course of action…</p>
<p>“I must apologise in advance, but I have a large hole in my sock” I said.</p>
<p>Now, discussing and exposing my ragged clothing – as you can imagine – was not meant to form part of the agenda for this important tête-à-tête.</p>
<p>Sarah’s response however was both merciful and profound…</p>
<p>“People are more interested in what you have to say rather than the state of your socks. And anyway, lots of people round here have holes in their socks”.</p>
<p>She was right. A sage lesson and one worth remembering.</p>
<p>Madam Mayor – I’m very much looking forward to working with you over the next year.</p>
<p>I have every faith you’ll be a huge success and a fantastic champion for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Congratulations again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, before I go any further I’d like to say a few words about the terrible situation in Ukraine because we are joined here tonight against the backdrop of the most appalling violence and misery.</p>
<p>I know we are all greatly inspired by the resolve, determination and spirit shown by the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>The response to the crisis from our community has been incredibly moving – we opened our hearts and our homes.</p>
<p>Naturally I wouldn’t have expected anything less.</p>
<p>We are of course twinned with a proud coalfield community in Ukraine – Horlivka.</p>
<p>A town which is now fighting for its very existence.</p>
<p>A fight it did not start, but from which it will not back down.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago – along with my great colleague and neighbour, Stephanie Peacock – I learned I had been personally sanctioned by the Russian parliament – something I see as a badge of honour because Barnsley stands united against Putin’s illegal invasion and we send our solidarity to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters both here and those resisting his barbaric regime.</p>
<p>Slava Ukraini!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do also want to say a word about the Platinum Jubilee – truly a milestone in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>The Queen – overseeing us this evening – has been the embodiment of service and stability, a constant in our lives and it is right we recognise her unwavering dedication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen… that brings me to another fantastic ambassador, albeit one closer to home – our outgoing Mayor,</p>
<p>Councillor Caroline Makinson.</p>
<p>Caroline… you have been a wonderful advocate for our community and helped see us through the pandemic. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you for all the work you have done – and will continue to do – for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d also like to say something about another outgoing Mayor… me!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the last time I had the honour of speaking at this event was for Councillor Steve Green back in 2018 – which was only a matter days after I had been elected the inaugural Mayor of South Yorkshire, or the Sheffield City Region as it was then.</p>
<p>I’m now back delivering this address but no longer as Mayor.</p>
<p>Let me be candid, many people were surprised at my decision to stand down, but I said from the beginning that being a Mayor and an MP wasn’t a long-term arrangement.</p>
<p>And I meant it.</p>
<p>Some thought that I would step away as MP and keep going with the mayoralty, but I have a fierce loyalty to our town.</p>
<p>You can’t choose where you were born but you can choose where you want to be – and I chose Barnsley.</p>
<p>I hope everyone knows what an enormous privilege it is for me to represent our community, and how seriously I take that responsibility.</p>
<p>Politicians come and go, of course – and if the people of Barnsley want to get rid of me as their MP, then that is their absolute right. But I am not walking away from them.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why… there is so much to celebrate about Barnsley – but above all, it is the enduring spirit of our people that sets us apart.</p>
<p>And why I hold this place so dear, and why I was never going to walk away from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community knows all too well the arc of history does not always necessarily steer to a better tomorrow. But we also know that together we have the power to bend it toward a more hopeful future.</p>
<p>When you walk through our town, you are walking through a chronicle of our past – lessons in who we are, voices reminding us of what we have achieved, inspiration for generations to come.</p>
<p>Just outside, we have our square dedicated to the Barnsley Pals battalions. Men who stepped forward to answer the call during the First World War.</p>
<p>Miners, glassworkers, stonemasons, clerics – many of them friends and neighbours. They joined-up together, trained together, fought together and ultimately, many of them died together.</p>
<p>It is a legacy that inspired some of Barnsley’s finest to serve. Tom Hicks who lived in Royston – a veteran of Arnhem who helped write the Airborne Forces into the annals of history.</p>
<p>And Sergeant Ian McKay, who was born in the borough – another member of that proud brotherhood, posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his sacrifice on Mount Longdon 40 years ago next month.</p>
<p>From the First World War to the Second, to the Falklands and every other conflict beyond, Barnsley’s men and women have consistently stepped forward to answer the call.</p>
<p>Their story reminds us that the lone hero is a myth – we are all in fact, threads, woven together to create something much stronger.</p>
<p>Walk down the Huddersfield Road and you’ll find the head office of the National Union of Mineworkers – a paragon of our community built on coal.</p>
<p>While the Pals’ struggle took them to foreign soil, the miners’ struggle was brought to their very doorstep.</p>
<p>To their detriment, successive governments failed to recognise it wasn’t just coal that came out from the collieries, but community too.</p>
<p>Theirs was a bond forged over generations. Mineworkers and their families wouldn’t run at the first sign of hardship, they held their ground and withstood hunger, smears and violence.</p>
<p>Their fight is a lesson in the meaning of true solidarity.</p>
<p>Down in our town centre, we now have our COVID memorial sculpture – one of the first in the world.</p>
<p>It’s our tribute to those no longer with us, to those who lost loves ones and to those working-class heroes who sacrificed so much to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Barnsley's fierce love <u>will</u> hold you forever in its heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community was left devasted by the pandemic, I know everyone here this evening has their own story – me included.</p>
<p>That suffering will live long in the memory but so too should the resolve of those who pulled us through – our NHS</p>
<p>workers, carers, delivery drivers, shopworkers, posties, transport staff, and many others. Too often taken for granted but</p>
<p>whose true value was there for all to see during our darkest hour.</p>
<p>Men and women from Barnsley have fought, struggled and laboured time and time again for our tomorrow. Their journey is one we continue.</p>
<p>But our story isn’t just one of triumph over adversity. We are so much more.</p>
<p>Barnsley’s sons and daughters have a long and proud history of stepping out and shaping a better world.</p>
<p>Just look at who was awarded the Freedom of the Borough last month alongside our phenomenal <strong>Intensive Care Unit</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Mat Wright – the musical director of the outstanding Barnsley Youth Choir</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Brunt – the world cup winning cricketer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham Ibbeson – the artist and sculptor</strong></p>
<p><strong>And Katherine Kelly – the acclaimed actress.</strong></p>
<p>Inspirational figures, and every one of them Barnsley to their core.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it isn’t just our people that are doing us proud, it’s our place.</p>
<p>Our town centre has undergone remarkable transformation in recent times – praise rightly goes to the Leader of our Council, Sir Steve Houghton and his team for the incredible progress we have seen.</p>
<p>I am however acutely aware not everyone always shares my enthusiasm for when the winds of change begin to blow!</p>
<p>I remember once being in complete awe stood outside our wonderful Town Hall by the newly installed fountains one summer morning – the sun was shining, children were paddling, laughter filled the air. It was a scene of pure joy.</p>
<p>I paused to soak up the experience when a gentleman appeared beside me.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, I could sense he was poised to deliver his judgement.</p>
<p>He then uttered the following – words that will stay with me evermore…</p>
<p>“It used to be a lovely little car park”</p>
<p>I believe Barnsley deserves more former lovely little car parks – we deserve the best because we are capable of the best.</p>
<p>Anyone who questions that ambition has a short memory, look at what we have achieved and how we have achieved it… as one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In every direction, there is much to do. Just as we emerge from a health crisis, we have entered an economic one. Families facing hardship, businesses facing uncertainty.</p>
<p>The challenges we face today and those we face tomorrow are daunting but like the challenges of yesterday, they will be overcome.</p>
<p>You only have to walk around our community and speak to the people who make it so special to know that holds true.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you take comfort in knowing I still have holes in my socks just as I take comfort in knowing our people don’t care, they are still more interested in what you have to say.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your evening. And Madam Mayor, congratulations once again. Thank you.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Preet Kaur Gill MP joined with pupils at St Paul's School for Girls to take part in online activities with children in Nigeria in the run up to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Preet and the children linked up with Bomas Academy in Jos, Nigeria, and exchanged information about their families, school life and favour subjects. </p>
<p>Steve Frew, who took gold in the 2002 games and 400m champion Lesley Owusu also joined them at the school for a morning of sporting activities. The event was part of Commonwealth Connections - a partnership between the British Council and the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. It involves 60 primary, secondary, and special schools in the West Midlands linking up with 60 schools across 10 Commonwealth countries. Through the partnership, children explore cultures and beliefs and learn how to communicate with people from different backgrounds and perspectives through sports and arts.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said: “Our wonderful city of Birmingham is one of the most diverse in the world and truly reflects the Commonwealth. It’s fantastic to see Commonwealth Connections promoting collaboration and encouraging young people to make new connections with people from different backgrounds and different countries. </p>
<p>“The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 affect us all and it’s vital young people, as future leaders, understand why these are so important. By talking to people across the world with different perspectives of how climate change and sustainability is impacting people’s lives is how we show how global Britain can be a force for good.” </p>
<p>During the event, St Paul’s School for Girls was presented with a British Council foundation level <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/accreditation/international-school-award/about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International School Award</a> by the organisation’s Senior Schools Consultant, John Rolfe MBE. The award champions schools that have shown a commitment to embedding international awareness and understanding in their classrooms and curriculums. The £500k Commonwealth Connections project is co-funded by Birmingham 2022 and the British Council.  </p>
<p>The British Council is delivering the project with Birmingham Education Partnership (BEP) and the children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust (YST). BEP has nominated its flagship Birmingham Arts School to lead on delivery of the arts and culture strand of the project. </p>

<p><strong>On Monday morning, Local MP Grant Shapps joined passengers at Welwyn Garden City Station to mark the beginning of new cross-London train services between Welwyn Garden City and Sevenoaks, Kent.</strong></p>



<p>The new Thameslink services will run every half an hour during weekday peak times &#8211; greatly benefitting those who commute into London from the area.</p>



<p>The link makes up the first-ever direct route across central London via Finsbury Park in the north and Elephant &amp; Castle in the south.</p>



<p>Passengers travelling from Welwyn Hatfield will also benefit from better access to the new Elizabeth Line which opens next week.</p>



<p>During the visit, Mr Shapps met with Tom Moran, Managing Director for Thameslink and Great Northern, as well as various other stakeholders from across the constituency, speaking to them about the new Thameslink service.</p>



<p>Commenting on the service Mr Shapps said, “it’s fantastic to see this new service being introduced, not only for the wider region, but also for my own Welwyn Hatfield constituents who will now be able to travel into London that bit easier.</p>



<p>“Increased connectivity between Welwyn Hatfield, London and Kent can only benefit residents, providing them with greater opportunities, and making the area a more prosperous and desirable place to live.”</p>



<p>When speaking of the service Mr Moran said, “We’re delighted we can now provide these extra seats and new journey opportunities for Hertfordshire and Northeast London commuters. The new route is a key part of the service uplift we’ve achieved for our passengers in the new summer timetable introduced this week.</p>



<p>“This timetable is the starting point for rebuilding our railway, working closely with our community and industry partners to support passengers and the economic recovery of both local and regional rail.”</p>

              <h3>Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br />
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”</span></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
