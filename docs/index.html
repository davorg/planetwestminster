<p>To get to net zero the Uk would have to shift most people away from petrol and diesel and aviation spirit  to electric transport , shift most away from fossil fuel to electric heating ,and  eliminate most fossil fuel use by business. This would require quadrupling the grid capacity and greatly increasing capacity of the cable system to every home and factory.</p>
<p>It will also be essential to end the output of the coal and gas power stations and find a way of storing and time shifting the output of wind turbines and solar panels.</p>
<p>How realistic is this on the time scales the government wishes? How is this done so there is enough renewable power in time for the new EVs and heat pumps? It’s pointless to put in wind farms if there is no grid to carry the power and self defeating to spend on EVs and heat pumps if the power is generated from gas.</p>
<p>So far there is no plan I can read for a massive expansion of the grid and cable systems let alone large sums of committed capital to build out the necessary facilities. There are planning rows over the modest additions to the grid being discussed. There is little thought about digging up the streets to provide more power to each home, nor positive thoughts about trying to bury the cables somewhere other than under the middle of the main roads.</p>
<p>Who will pay for all this? Presumably it will fall to electricity consumers as ways are found to add all this to bills. It would be good to know how much of an increase this might entail.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the Welsh Labour Government and Transport for Wales have NO plans to follow suit and that staffing at Llanelli Station and others across Wales will remain unaffected by these plans.</p>



<p>For those who travel across the border regularly and who would like to respond to the consultation in England, you can do so here: </p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is supporting a new survey from the charity <a href="https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/support-us/sponsor?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoK2mBhDzARIsADGbjepJZDdJsxc2NBDG5XwJjynLd5pKSUrUiqioJLqXPXh89tK1NeURm_IaAs66EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Dogs Trust</a> which aims to provide better support to people who may need to give up their dogs, with the goal of improving the welfare of both dogs and people.</p>
<p>Dogs Trust reached out to Gwynne, as an MP with a rehoming centre in his constituency, to spread awareness of this unique survey that aims to understand the painful circumstances that lead to someone relinquishing their dog.</p>
<p>Data released by Dogs Trust last year revealed that the charity was receiving a record number of calls from people asking the charity to take in their dogs, in the face of the increased cost of living. An online poll recently carried out for Dogs Trust found that one in ten dog owners (13%) has been forced into debt in order to care for their dog, with 15% saying that they would struggle to pay an unexpected vet bill of £100.</p>
<p>The Dogs Trust contact centre in Denton had one of the busiest years in its history last year. Dogs Trust’s Contact Centre can be contacted Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm, on 020 7837 0006 or at <a href="mailto:info@dogstrust.org.uk">info@dogstrust.org.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This is an incredibly complex and emotional issue, and I’m really pleased that Dog’s Trust UK are working proactively to address it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As the cost-of-living crisis continues to put pressure on ordinary people, the need to support dog owners and their pets couldn’t be more important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you’re a dog owner who’s struggling, or have relinquished a pet in the past, please do fill in this anonymous survey. It’ll help inform the brilliant work of Dogs Trust UK, so that future dogs won’t have to suffer or be separated from their loving owners unnecessarily.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been announced that major work will begin in autumn 2023 on the transformation of part of the old Broad Marsh shopping centre site into a green heart for the city. Back in December 2021, Nottingham City Council under Nottingham Labour announced the ambitious and forward-thinking plans to transform a derelict area of the city, into a vibrant heart for the city. In our manifesto we pledged to deliver a high biodiversity ‘Green Heart’ at the centre of the Broadmarsh redevelopment, in line with the results of the consultation and Broadmarsh Vision.<br></p>



<p>We are proud that the recent announcement sets out how we will work toward achieving this goal, while setting out the key aims for the project, and the impact it will have on the city. Images have been released showing what the results of the work will be. They showcase a green natural landscape, an area of urban wetland, returning the Broad Marsh back to its historical ecosystem, and a place that will provide a quiet haven for residents in the very heart of our city.<br></p>



<p>A unique design has been developed by Townshend Landscape Architects working with Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. On Collins Street work has already begun on a public space outside the library, with a focus on ensuring it is a child friendly space. Local children were consulted on the design so that it will fulfil their needs and be a space for all families to relax and play in our city centre.<br></p>



<p>The Green Heart will be connected to Lister Gate via a people-friendly green space, that will be closed to traffic. Alongside Nottingham College there is a miniature amphitheatre, skate area and multi-use games. This will encourage young people to make use of the Green Heart and is already providing college students a green clean area to relax and unwind in free time and after classes. This is not part of the Green Heart itself but compliments the prospective development of the Green Heart.<br></p>



<p>The Green Heart area will be full of seating, pocket spaces and paths, so people can enjoy and experience the nature surrounding them, boosted by ecologically rich planting. By re-introducing urban wetlands, not only are we returning it to its historical ecosystem, but it will also fulfil a use in potentially preventing flooding by capturing and holding rainwater.<br></p>



<p>Considering the likelihood of increased storms, unpredictable and more extreme weather due to climate change, such wetland will hopefully play a role in protecting the city centre, as well as really serving to boost and creating biodiversity in the city.<br></p>



<p>Finally, sandstone, which is what Nottingham’s famous caves were cut from, will be used for all the paving and seating. This really help to stamp the uniqueness of Nottingham on the development and make sure that it reflects the history and location of the city.<br></p>



<p>This project shows the ambition and commitment of Nottingham City Council and Nottingham Labour, Despite difficult times and despite the government refusing our levelling-up bid to fund this project, we are still moving forward with work that is unique, forward-thinking and that will truly benefit Nottingham residents, while being environmentally conscious.<br></p>



<p>Cllr David Mellen, Leader of Nottingham City Council, said: “Anyone who has visited the area recently will see how much it has changed with lots of greenery, pedestrianised areas and seating. The creation of the Green Heart will take the transformation of Broad Marsh a major step further and be a beautiful addition to the city centre which is unique to Nottingham. I’m particularly pleased that Collin Street will be a family friendly space that people can enjoy right outside the new Central Library.”</p>

<p><span><span><span>That is why I recently hosted a meetings with Cash Access UK, Cllrs Claire Bowes, Tristan Ashby, Samantha Taylor, Taila Taylor, and Tina Kiddell, alongside Andrew Holdsworth (Assistant Director for Economy and Growth at Breckland Council) to discuss the implementation of local banking hubs in Attleborough and Watton.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We all recognised the role that accessible banking plays in both everyday life and local commerce. Therefore, I was pleased to hear of the encouraging progress being made to secure a local banking hub in Watton, and the continued efforts and openness to the proposal in Attleborough. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to fight for local banking provision throughout our Mid Norfolk community, knowing how important this is to residents. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>The MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Grant Shapps, joined team members from Osprey Charging Network in visiting their new EV Charging Hub.<br><br></strong>Situated next to The Bakehouse pub and an Aldi supermarket, and owned and operated by Osprey Charging, the chargers are an ideal place to charge an EV whilst going shopping or for a bite to eat. The new rapid charge points are compatible with every EV on the market and can add 100 miles of range in as little as 10 minutes, depending on the model of the vehicle and its battery.<br><br>At the hub, Mr Shapps discussed with Osprey CEO Ian Johnston the capabilities of the eight newly installed 300kW ultra-rapid EV chargers, all of which accept bank cards in line with new government regulations.<br><br>Mr Shapps, being an owner of an electric car, was impressed by the new charging hubs and commended Osprey on bringing their rapid charging technology to Welwyn Hatfield. He commented:<br><br>“I’m delighted to see the expansion of Osprey’s EV charging site, which has proved to be an important asset to Welwyn Hatfield’s EV drivers. Fast, reliable and easy-to-use public EV charging locations such as this hub are vitally important and practically support the uptake of electric vehicles at the local level too.”<br><br>Ian Johnston, the CEO of Osprey, thanked Mr Shapps for his visit and emphasised Osprey’s priority of providing for the growing demand for public EV charging across the constituency:<br><br>“A crucial element of our strategy at Osprey is to understand the requirements of our customers and adapt the network to meet growing customer demand, installing more chargers in locations where they are needed. The Bakehouse is one of our most popular sites, and now the latest in our rollout of 150 high-power hubs, including upgrading existing in-demand locations such as this.”<br><br>Mr Shapps thanked the Osprey team for inviting him to see their new EV Charging Hub location and looks forward to seeing the public and himself using it in the near future.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<div id="fb-root"></div>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, continues to campaign for fundamental reform of air weapon laws. She has highlighted the need for the Home Office to widen their firearms consultation to take air weapons into account.</p>
<p>The Member of Parliament for Bristol South has sought changes to air weapon laws following an incident in her constituency. An 18-month-old constituent was shot in the head with an air weapon by an adult. He now lives with a lifelong disability as a result, including partial blindness and daily seizures.</p>
<p>The Government previously undertook a review into air weapons, which Karin Smyth MP submitted evidence. But little action as been taken in England and Wales by the Home Office to reform legislation.</p>
<p>The licensing of air weapons is different across the UK:</p>
<p>•	In England and Wales there is no need to acquire a licence to hold an air weapon.<br />
•	In Scotland air weapons owners need a specific <a href="https://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/firearms-and-explosives-licensing/air-weapons/">air weapons licence</a>.<br />
•	In Northern Ireland air weapons owners need a <a href="https://www.psni.police.uk/advice_information/firearms/know-the-law/">firearms licence</a>.</p>
<p>The current firearms review launched by the Home Office is in response to the Senior Coroner for Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon inquest into the deaths of those shot and killed by a licensed shotgun owner in Keyham on 12 August 2021.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“I welcome the Home Office launching a review into firearms licencing in England and Wales. The tragedy of the Keyham shootings in 2021 highlight how much we must continue to reform and strengthen our laws to protect people. But this is a missed opportunity to also consider air weapon licencing. </p>
<p>“The previous Air Weapons Review promised much but delivered little. Despite taking the Home Office over three years to respond to the 50,000 submissions, the findings have been summarised in just a few paragraphs. There is no evidence from Scotland, where air weapons are licensed. However, the latest figures from Scotland show that there were 190 offences recorded involving air weapons in 2015/16, prior to the introduction of licensing and 127 in 2017/18 after licensing.</p>
<p>“I’ve long campaigned to tighten our laws to protect residents. We know locally the horrific outcomes from misuse of air weapons and I’m clear that licensing is the only way forward. I urge the Home Office to advance measures that make our streets safer against air weapon incidents.”</p>

              <h3>Drew Hendry (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">The A9 dualling is a totemic issue for people living in the Highlands. From the moment we set off on the road, we know the risks it carries—the tragedies that can unfold, impacting not only those who act recklessly or impatiently but also innocent road users who fall victim to these avoidable accidents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For years, we endured the worry that comes with understanding just how dangerous the road can be – that&#8217;s why the promise to dual the road was so welcome.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But a promise is nothing without action, and serious action was needed to get this project over the line.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no denying that the dualling project has faced its fair share of legitimate issues. We understand the immensity of the programme, but what matters is that we don&#8217;t have a safe road yet and we were promised one.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, it was a mistake for the Scottish Government to set the expectation of completing the entire dualling project by 2025 without ensuring the necessary resources, engineering, planning, and contractors could meet that timeline.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And so, we find ourselves at this juncture – frustrated and disappointed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why last week&#8217;s Courier&#8217;s A9 summit was such an important intervention. It allowed families of those who&#8217;ve lost loved ones, local campaigners and people from the business community to have their voices heard by the Cabinet Secretary and her officials.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She will be in no doubt about the seismic impact this road&#8217;s danger has on our local communities and regular road users, and I know from conversations I&#8217;ve had and the Cabinet Secretary&#8217;s own words at the Summit that getting this right is a top priority for her and the First Minister.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Still, trust needs to be earned, and the people in the Highlands will not settle for anything less than a clear plan with achievable milestones for completion – and the budget commitment to back it up. My colleagues and I will certainly be on the case to ensure that outcome.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen major investment here by the Scottish Government in recent years, but people will quickly forget the new Justice centre, the £135m City region deal funding, the UHI campus, rail improvements, the new IRA school, the city flood prevention and the many other investments made here if the A9 dualling is not delivered.</p>

<p>With the Summer Holiday’s having now begun across Aldridge-Brownhills I wanted to highlight once again the Summer Reading Challenge in our local Libraries.</p>
<p>This summer, children aged 4-11 can visit their local library to get involved with the Summer Reading Challenge. So, get ready for a whole load of team spirit, and plenty of fun with the latest collection for the 2023 sports and games themed Summer Reading Challenge: Ready, Set, Read!</p>
<p>Each book has been specially chosen by an expert group of readers for everybody taking part to enjoy. Call in to any one of our Libraries across the constituency for more information on how you can get involved.</p>
<p>The Summer Reading Challenge has been running since 1999 and helps to improve children’s reading skills and confidence of reading over the summer holidays, ensuring they are ready for their return to school.</p>
<p>This is a great initiative and one that I am delighted to be once again supporting. I am looking forward throughout the recess to visit local libraries in Aldridge-Brownhills who will be participating.</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update on a couple of local issues.</p>
<p>*<strong>CONSULTATION – STATION TICKET OFFICES</strong>*</p>
<p>Some of you will be aware that the railway industry is carrying out a consultation on the future of station ticket offices. Only a very small proportion of ticket sales are now carried out via ticket offices, and the industry is looking to repeat what was done on the London Underground some years ago by moving staff out from fixed ticket offices and onto the platform to carry out a broader range of customer support activity.</p>
<p>I know that for some people this is a controversial proposal, and so I wanted to make sure that you were aware of how to take part in the consultation if you want to do so.</p>
<p>This link will take you to the consultation so that you can take part.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/uk-rail-industry/customer-focused-reform/customer-focused-stations">https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/uk-rail-industry/customer-focused-reform/customer-focused-stations</a></p>
<p>*<strong>SUTTON HOSPITAL UPDATE</strong>*</p>
<p>I have been asked to provide an update about what is happening about the proposed new hospital at Sutton.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the project has just been given the final go-ahead, and the remaining applications for planning consent are due to be submitted. Assuming that the local authority in Sutton gives permission, the new hospital will open in the second half of this decade.</p>
<p>It will provide emergency services and care for more serious conditions across our area. But most of the work currently done at Epsom Hospital will be retained, as most blue light emergencies and the treatment of serious conditions are largely already handled elsewhere.</p>
<p>*ASHTEAD GOOD NEIGHBOURS*</p>
<p>I have been asked by Ashtead Good Neighbours, who provide drivers for people needing help to get to things like hospital appointments, to say that they are in need of new volunteers.</p>
<p>Their contact details are:  <a href="mailto:ashteadgn@gmail.com">ashteadgn@gmail.com</a> – and their website is <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Fmq2CMw3pCqV3QlMukJSnt?domain=agn.uk.net">www.agn.uk.net</a></p>
<p>I hope you have a good summer.</p>

<p>Last week, I led a parliamentary debate on ending animal testing for new drugs and medicines. It&#8217;s a controversial subject with renewed interest since news that, after a 25-year ban, the government has agreed to resume some tests for cosmetic ingredients.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll confess that, despite knowing how strongly people feel about animal testing, I&#8217;ve been inclined to defend it when told it could lead to new cures and treatments for conditions which cause human death and suffering.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve changed my mind since meeting with Animal Free Research UK and scientists at the Institute of Translational Medicine at the University of Birmingham. I discovered that 92% of drugs and treatments that show promise during animal tests fail to successfully translate to safe and effective human medicines. This is because animal biology is very different to humans. Equally important, we&#8217;re now capable of producing better tests, based on human biology and new technologies. Liver-on-a-chip (micro-chip) technology has a far greater success rate in predicting whether a new medicine will prove toxic to the human liver than any animal experiment.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a rapidly growing sector which can create jobs for the future and where Britain can take a significant lead. Several companies are already based here but the USA is making huge inroads and might leave the British research behind unless we act quickly. There&#8217;s little doubt that the work of the Precision Health Technologies Accelerator in my Selly Oak constituency could be a real gamechanger.</p>



<p>One experiment I witnessed in Birmingham involves a lab model of a human cornea which researchers hope will allow real advances in treating eye conditions and perhaps lead to restoring the sight of some who have gone blind.</p>



<p>As with all exciting initiatives, we need government support. Now is the time to get behind this work, phase out animal research and ensure that a city like ours becomes a world leader.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the spirit of supporting all women’s sport at all levels, in all countries, I attended the reception hosted by The Football Association for the Lionesses, England Women’s Football team, ahead of the FIFA World Cup in Australia and New Zealand starting on 20th July. My friend Tracey Crouch MP hosted the event, at which the guests were Secretary of State for Education Gillian Keegan MP, FA’s Director of Women’s Football, Baroness Sue Campbell, and England Women record goal scorer, Ellen White MBE. It’s gratifying to know how much the women’s game has grown in support and funding, and at senior level, Wales Women Football team has improved so much, despite being semi-professional, and having a smaller population to choose from than England. I am encouraged to learn that grassroots female football in Wales has blossomed due to the success of the senior national team, especially the junior girls’ structure, which is a good sign for the future of football in Wales. I was so disappointed to see Wales just miss out on qualification for the World Cup, but after reaching the play-off final of a major tournament for the first time, I am in no doubt that they will qualify next time, and I will be supporting them all the way!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended River Action’s parliamentary reception about the crisis our rivers are facing and the launch of its <a href="https://riveractionuk.com/charter-for-rivers/">Charter for Rivers</a> which sets out ten key actions needed to restore our rivers and fresh waters to health by 2030. River Action is a UK environmental charity committed to addressing the severe river pollution, particularly caused by agricultural and food industry practices, and sewage discharge by water companies, and has an Advisory Board with Lord Randall, Ben Goldsmith, Marina Gibson, and Jeremy Wade. The Charter has been endorsed by Wildlife and Countryside Link, The Rivers Trust, National Trust, British Rowing, Nature Friendly Farming, WWF, The Soil Association, and others. Recent River Action polling revealed that 94% of the British public support the need for healthy rivers by 2030, and almost 50% want it to be a top priority in political Party manifestos.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Business in the Chamber was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-03/debates/CF82F174-BC12-452A-B9B0-F67B7940CCCC/EconomicActivityOfPublicBodies(OverseasMatters)Bill">Second Reading of the Economic Act of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill</a>. The Labour Party tabled a Reasoned Amendment presented by Lisa Nandy, which was pushed to a vote, and was defeated by 272-212 votes. The Labour Party then decided to abstain on the Second Reading vote, which was carried by 268-70 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Environment APPG chaired by Shaun Spiers, executive director of Green Alliance, met to discuss Deep Sea Mining (DSM). The deep sea holds vast amounts of valuable metals and minerals used in technologies that will help power the green transition. But <a href="https://ejfoundation.org/reports/towards-the-abyss-deep-sea-mining">research suggests that DSM</a> could have devastating environmental impacts that remain poorly understood and many countries have called for a moratorium or precautionary pause. This new form of mineral exploitation which would likely become the largest mining operation in history were it to start, would significantly disturb the delicate environment of the deep sea, with devastating consequences for our ocean, wildlife, and the people who depend on it. The roundtable discussion explored the key questions concerning the relationship between the nascent DSM industry, the demand for raw materials for the green energy transition, ocean conservation, governance and the scope of the scientific understanding of the pristine habitats and ecosystems of the deep sea. Lara Shirra White, campaigner for Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) gave an overview of DSM. Dr Helen Scales, marine biologist, writer and broadcaster, provided an insight into the environmental aspect of DSM. Hannah Lily, ocean law expert, spoke about the realities of a moratorium and legal pathways to protect the ocean. Libby Peak, Head of resource policy, Green Alliance, addressed the links between DSM, the green transition, and how to resource the switch to renewable energy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pleasure to meet Baroness Anita Gale in the Lords to have our weekly catch up and share what is happening in the Commons, Lords, Neath and Wales. Anita was the first female General Secretary of Welsh Labour, and a role model for me and many other women in Welsh politics. Anita introduced all women short lists (AWS) in Wales so that women had an equal opportunity of being selected to become an MP or an MS, until parity was reached. I was honoured to be elected the 443rd female MP to Parliament and this was due to an AWS. Anita has been active in the Lords since her appointment in 1999 and has been the frontbench spokesperson for Wales and Equalities. The APPG for Parkinson’s will be holding a reception for Anita to celebrate 30 years of Anita chairing our APPG.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected a vice chair at the AGM of the APPG Hospitality, Events, Food and Drink Businesses. Civil servants from the Department for Business and Trade DBT gave us a presentation on the support that it offers to businesses who want to export for the first time, or want to expand the export part of their business. The DBT representatives also told us about their export champions initiative where businesses who have made a success of exporting their goods seek to network with businesses looking to export in order to explain all the processes and challenges, but also outline the support that the DBT can give to smooth the transition from expanding from the domestic market to dealing abroad. The DBT offers the UK Export Academy, Export Support Service, Export Champion programme, and its “Made in the UK, Sold to the World” campaign. It was so good to see Gemma Nesbitt who used to work In Regeneration and Economic Development for NPT Council, before becoming the Sector Lead DIT (replaced by the Department for Business and Trade) Wales, responsible for trade promotion, inward investment for food and drink, agriculture and agritech, life sciences and medtech.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Phil Jones, chair of Regional and National LGBT+ at <a href="https://www.unitetheunion.org/">Unite the Union</a> to discuss equality issues in Neath and Wales, and the marvellous work that Unite are doing to represent LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities in Wales. Phil lives in Neath, and I have been proud to be one of his friends for 10 years. Phil and I will be meeting Jo Galzaka who is our mutual dearest friend and is the Welsh Regional Women’s and Equalities Officer for Unite, to make plans to continue with raising awareness of equality issues in Neath and Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was unlucky again not to be drawn on the Order Paper for <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-05/debates/7BFBB8C6-A571-4776-843A-4071FE2820E3/OralAnswersToQuestions">Wales Questions</a>, but I “bobbed”, and I was fortunate to be called by Mr Speaker. The Welsh Minister James Davies MP was assigned to answer my question, and I asked him as a GP he knows the value of community engagement, so would he ask the Home Secretary to increase investment in Policing in Wales to ensure an efficient response to tackle crime when bad things happen? The Minister told me that “the Hon Member is aware that there are more police officers in all the forces in Wales than ever before. The Government and the Home Office have been investing in the Uplift Programme and ensuring that there is a strong police presence across Wales.” I subsequently contacted Alun Michael (PCC for South Wales) to ask him to verify the Minister’s assertion because the published statistics for police officers is very difficult to interpret. Ministers, as did the Wales Minister, tend to talk about total numbers, but there are different ways of counting the number of officers in each force, and it is very challenging to derive the facts. Some officers are seconded to national, or other regional forces, some officers have been added through the Uplift Programme, some forces have failed to recruit the additional numbers they have been allocated through Uplift, and some forces have not been allocated the number of officers they lost through the cuts of officers due to the UK Government austerity policies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the Alcohol Awareness Week 2023 event, coordinated by <a href="https://alcoholchange.org.uk/">Alcohol Change UK</a> and hosted by my friend Dan Carden MP. Each year over 5,000 public health teams, workplaces, GP surgeries, pharmacies, hospitals, charities, and community groups sign up to take part. The aim is to ensure people have increased knowledge around alcohol can make more informed choices about their drinking, seek support, and support those struggling. An Alcohol Change UK survey found that the average drinker spends nearly £62,900 on alcohol in a lifetime, 19% stated alcohol was an essential item, 9% prioritised alcohol over other items, 15% said in the last 6 months they were worried how much they’re drinking, citing socialising, and those drinking less (44%) said they did so for mental and physical reasons, and the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pleasure to meet Michael Rosen at the <a href="https://www.sla.org.uk/">Great School Libraries</a> event and talk about the joy of reading, and its ability to unlock words for children. Unfortunately, I didn’t read as a child, and have spent every day since making up for lost time. Michael Rosen is an author, poet, presenter, political columnist, and broadcaster. He has written 140 children’s books, served as Children’s Laureate from 2007-2009, and won the PEN Pinter Prize for his “fearless” body of work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the launch of the <a href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/the-impact-of-place-based-approaches-to-tackling-youth-unemployment-new-appg-for-youth-employment-report/">APPG for Youth Employment Inquiry Report</a> which looked at place-based approaches to tackling youth unemployment. It’s aims were to: understand challenges facing young people accessing education, training, and employment opportunities where they live; how place-based solutions are working; and what works. The inquiry heard oral evidence from 15 stakeholder organisations from local government, mayors, employers, charities, and young people, plus 18 pieces of written evidence. The key findings about place-based opportunities are: unfairness at a macro and micro level, in all communities; place plays an important role in access to a range of services and positive transitions to employment; interplay between economic and social deprivation and NEET rates; range of challenges including poor career advice, poor connectivity; and place-based approaches to work. Recommendations are that the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities should: recognise place-based approaches as key to tackling youth unemployment by including a commitment as one of the White Paper missions; review and evaluate the impact of Trailblazer devolution deals to identify best practice; establish a Youth Unemployment Task Force. The DWP should: have an expanded brief for NEETs, funding for local Jobcentres to outreach to young people; and build on Youth Hubs successes. The UK Government should set out a long-term strategy for youth employment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I dropped into the <a href="http://bduk-exec-office@dcms.gov.uk/">Building Digital UK</a> (BDUK) event and met the CE of BDUK Paul Norris who explained that this UK Government programme is aimed to deliver gigabit-capable broadband to UK premises in rural and hard to reach areas which are not covered by suppliers’ commercial rollout schemes. Mr Norris confirmed that Building Digital UK does cover households in Neath, and I look forward to a Wales specific event that he intends to hold in the autumn, so that I can learn more about the offers and delivery timescale for Neath constituents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the day of the 75th anniversary of the creation of the NHS, 5th July, I attended the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Aneurin-Bevan-Society/100070325373053/">Bevan Society Lecture</a>with guest speaker Professor Sir Michael Marmot, and a panel discussion featuring David Brindle, Sara Gorton, and Professor Laura Serrant OBE, on the future of the NHS. Professor Marmot is professor of epidemiology, University College London, and director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity. He is author of The Health Gap, and has led research groups on health inequalities for 50 years. He published The Marmot Review in February 2010; The Marmot Review:10 years on in February 2020; and Build Back Fairer: The Covid-19 Marmot Review. Professor Marmot’s first review found that the rate of increase of life expectancy slowed dramatically in 2010/11, which reversed a century long trend. The UK Government suggested that the UK had peaked for life expectancy, but comparisons with other countries disproved this. The greater the deprivation, the greater the inequities, and life expectancy for the poorest people living outside London is getting worse. If you’re rich it doesn’t matter where in the UK you live. Marmot says the UK Government was proud of its mission to cut public expenditure, but in cutting it in a highly regressive way, the poorer the community the greater the reduction. UK Government policy increased poverty and made inequality worse. David Brindle is a leading commentator on social care issues with more than 30 years’ experience of the sector as a journalist and non-executive. He joined the Guardian in 1988 and became Public Services Editor in 2020. He has won several awards and is currently chair of Ambient Support social care provider. Sara Gorton is Head of Health at Unison where she runs the union’s UK bargaining, influencing, and campaigning work for members in the health sector. She leads the joint NHS trade unions and interacts with UK Government, employers, and system leaders on industrial and workforce policy, and is currently co-chair of the NHS Staff Council, the England NHS Social Partnership Forum, and the Cavendish Coalition. Sara provided the trade union perspective on 75 years of the NHS. Professor Laura Serrant was the first of her family to attend university and one of the first to qualify as a nurse through a degree. She appeared in BBC4 Documentary Black Nurses: the women who saved the NHS, and after fulfilling many roles, in 2018 was appointed the first black woman to head a school of nursing at Manchester Metropolitan University. In October 2017 Laura wrote a poem “You called….and we came” to recognise and celebrate the contribution made by black nurses to the health system in England, and shone a light on the hardships, prejudice, and challenges faced by brave men and women like her parents who responded to the call from England to leave their Commonwealth Island and rebuild the motherland after WW2. She shared the poem with her musician son Rob Green and musical director Christella Latras, and it was set to haunting music and danced to by the Phoenix Dance Theatre. Laura read her very moving poem at the end of the event.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was delighted to attend the Age UK where I spoke with Rhian Morgan from <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/cymru/">Age Cymru</a> who told me about the well-being programmes that they are delivering across Wales, including: low impact functional training (LIFT); Nordic Walking; Tai Chi; Arts and Creativity; independent advocacy; dementia advocacy; and support for carers. Rhian invited me to visit Age Cymru office in Splott so that I could meet the staff and learn more about their superb work supporting older people who are facing some of the hardest challenges imaginable. Some live in poverty or can’t get the care they need. Loneliness is a daily struggle with only the radio or TV for company. Age Cymru’s vision is an age-friendly Wales where older people enjoy good health, live safely, free from discrimination, and active in their communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was in the Chamber to sit next to my friend Rachael Maskell when she presented her <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-11/debates/7435C28E-7F68-4747-BD9C-EDCA0824B2AD/BullyingAndRespectAtWork">10 minute Rule Bill</a> to provide a statutory definition of bullying at work; enable claims of workplace bullying to be considered by an Employment Tribunal; introduce a Respect at Work Code setting minimum standards for positive and respectful work environments; give powers to EHRC to investigate workplaces and organisations where there’s evidence of a culture of bullying; and powers to take enforcement actions. Rachael’s Bill will receive its Second Reading on 24th November 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism it was an honour to introduce a meeting on medicines labelling and ingredients. The aims of the meeting were: discuss the need for clear labelling of medical products which use animal derived ingredients and why this is important to the vegan and vegetarian community and those from faith groups and to discuss any action that could be taken to encourage the use of non-animal derived alternatives wherever possible. We held our first ever APPG event on 6th December 2016 and we heard from consultant gastroenterologist Dr Kinesh Patel on the potential to shape the regulation of medication and medical products after Brexit so they are suitable for vegans and vegetarians. We called on the Health Department to mandate labelling of medicines to indicate if derived from animals and switch to plant-based alternatives where viable in the long-term. But didn’t have a response. We held a follow-up meeting on 26th April 2022 after Brexit negotiations had concluded where we revisited the issues which hadn’t improved and wrote to the then Health Secretary Matt Hancock, but he did not respond. The distinguished and knowledgeable panel at the meeting were: Moussa Haddad, Head of Research and Policy at Vegetation for Life, who spoke about Veganism as a philosophical belief and the reasons why Vegans’ rights should be protected in medical settings; Evie Sier, a vegan patient who suffers from a heart condition which requires regular medication, but this is not available as an animal-free option; Yasmin Aktar, Community Organiser for British Islamic Medical Association, spoke about religious groups’ experiences of acquiring medication; Dr Ishani Rao, former Junior Doctor and trainee GP at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, who spoke about prescribing medicines in the community and the lack of knowledge and provision of animal-free medicines; and pharmacist Paul Fleming, Technical Director for the British Generic Manufacturers Association BGMA, who formally worked for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). There was agreement amongst the panellists that labelling of existing medicines was not clear enough for Vegetarians and Vegans to discern whether content is animal-free. Much of the detailed information is contained on a small print paper included inside the medicine box, is very difficult to decipher, and the animal content information is often at the very end of the paper. There is a need for a knowledgeable website which could provide accurate details of the contents of medicines, which could be easily accessed by Doctors, pharmacists, and the public. There are very few animal-free content medicines options available, and in life threatening situations, vegans and vegetarians have to choose between taking animal content medicines or dying, and Evie spoke very emotionally about this choice that she faces everyday of her life. She has had to forgo her belief in order to live. There is more research on animal-free medicines but pharmaceutical companies are not economically motivated to produce these, and the MHRA is slow to approve them. However, where the actual content of the medicine is animal free, but it is packed into gelatinous capsules, these could easily be replaced by pectin capsules at the same or less costs, which would remove the necessity for vegans and vegetarians to decant these gelatin capsule medicines, which may result in a lower dose being taken, due to the loss of some of the medicine during the decanting procedure. I raised the very concerning data released on 8th July by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Hampshire and Kent Scientific Services inspectors found that 24 of 61 food products (31%) marked as vegan that they tested contained traces of egg or dairy, including 13 dairy alternatives and 48 meat alternatives; some people confuse the vegan label with free-from allergens such as milk and eggs. The “vegan trademark” denotes products that are vegan as far as possible, which are strict but achievable standards for brands when they register to be awarded the vegan trademark to ensure customers can rely that efforts are made to avoid cross contamination within food services. But this is not guaranteeing free-from allergens because most factories produce non-vegan food and vegan food in the same place, and some cross contamination may take place, which is why some vegan products have “May Contain Milk” on them. But if vegan food had to be made in vegan factories this would drastically reduce provision, and a major problem is that there is no legal definition of vegan food. We hope to discuss these issues at the next APPG meeting in the autumn.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the AGM of the APPG for Compassion in Politics whose aim is to put compassion, inclusion, and co-operation at the heart of politics, to nominate my friend Debbie Abrahams be re-elected chair, and I was honoured to be elected as one of the vice-chairs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was the return of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-11/debates/5D96460C-A67B-4782-B74B-89BDD8ACE51A/IllegalMigrationBill">Illegal Migration Bill</a> from the Lords who had made 114 amendments with cross-Party support, of which 18 were pushed to a vote in the Commons. The UK Government instructed its Conservative MPs to disagree with all Lords Amendments, and won every vote, but 16 Conservative MPs rebelled on Lords Amendment 56. The rebellion was led by former PM Theresa May who spoke in favour of amendment 56, warning that if it is overthrown, “it will consign more people to slavery, no doubt about it”, but the UK Government still defeated the amendment by 285-243 votes, a majority of 42. The votes took nearly 4 hours. I supported all the Lords’ amendments. The Bill was sent back to the Lords so that they could give consideration to the disagreements in the Commons, which took most of the following day, and the Bill will return to the Commons in the near future because the UK Government has indicated that they want the Bill to become an Act before the summer recess begins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I called in to the <a href="https://kinship.org.uk/">Kinship Care</a> event to support the #ValueOurLove campaign, and met Lorna, a kinship carer from Cardiff, whom I have had the privilege to meet before. The campaign is urging UK Government to give kinship carers a right to paid leave, like adoptive parents, not a P45.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met doctors from <a href="https://gbss.org.uk/">Group B Strep Support</a> which is the leading charity working to stop Strep B infection in babies. Strep B is the UK’s most common cause of life-threatening infection in newborn babies and of meningitis in children. Approximately 800 babies will develop Strep B every year, with 50 dying, and 70 recovering with life-changing disabilities, which is nearly double the rate of other high-income countries. There is an ongoing landmark clinical trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research named GBS3 is exploring whether routinely testing pregnant women for Strep B will prevent more infections than the UK’s current risk-based approach. GBS3 will involve 320,000 pregnant women, and cost £4.2 million, is run by Nottingham School of Medicine, has 71 sites signed up across England and Wales and will report its results in 2025. Testing-based strategy has been shown to reduce early onset group B Strep by up to 86% in countries which routinely test all pregnant women. Whereas since 2023 the UK has used a risk-factor prevention strategy looking at situations in which a pregnant woman has an increased risk of her baby developing GBS infection has risen by 19%.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a Deferred Division because when a procedure motion was presented to Mr Speaker ratifying the Parliament recess periods for the summer, the conference period, and Christmas 2023 under Standing Order 25 was challenged by an MP, who does not have to state the reason. Under Standing Order 41A, the Deferred Division takes place the day after the challenge is made, and MPs are handed out pink papers in the Division Lobby by clerks between 11.30-2.30pm. Each MP who chooses to vote ticks the Aye or Nae box. The clerks then collect the papers and tally the votes. The result was 395-5 in favour of the recess periods taking place on the dates published.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I held a <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1679454122859429888?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">celebration event for my Shark Fins Act</a> receiving its Royal Assent (on 29th June at 11.06am) when the Lords Speaker announced it in the Lords Chamber. My Act prohibits the import and export of detached shark fins and shark fin-containing products in Great Britain, with routes available for conservation related exemptions. It also extends an existing prohibition on shark finning in place for UK fishing vessels to all vessels operating in UK waters. I was very humbled by the number of people who dropped into the event to show their support. The Shark Conservation charities brought along lots of shark fun stuff. Alex from Shark Guardian brought some amazing shark suits, and some children’s books about the history and lives of sharks. Graham from Bite Back Shark and Marine Conservation brought the biggest banner I have ever seen with a picture of a full-size shark on it, and some luggage tags with fins on them. Ali Hood from The Shark Trust brought “The Big Shark Pledge” banner with important statistics about sharks on it. I shall be forever grateful to the Parliamentarians from all Parties who spoke in support of the Bill as it passed through the Second Reading, Committee Stage, and Third Reading in the Commons and the Lords, and most of them called in to have their celebration photos taken. There are too many to mention them all, so I’ll just give you a flavour of my wonderful day. Baroness Maggie Jones of Whitchurch took my Bill through the Lords. Maggie was having a very busy day, but she found some time to call in. Maggie was a pleasure to work with and ensured that my Bill had cross-Party support in the Lords. Maggie and I have become friends. Minister for Victims and Sentencing, Ed Argar MP and I have been friends since we worked together on my first Private Members’ Bill (PMB) to add mothers’ names and occupations on marriage certificates, because in 2015 this wasn’t possible, and hadn’t been since marriage certificates were created. Unfortunately, the UK Government didn’t support my PMB, but consequently introduced its own legislation for this provision. Ed had resigned from the UK Government when my Bill was at Second Reading, so was able to speak in support from the Conservative backbenches. It was timely because Ed was reappointed to the UK Government two weeks later. My friend Steve Double MP was the UK Government Minister who spoke from the frontbench at Second Reading, and I remember how surprised and thrilled I was when he said that his Government were supporting my Bill. Once the UK Government signalled its support, Conservative Whip Rebecca Harris MP, who is in charge of Friday Sittings for PMBs, was a key figure in coordinating support. Rebecca and I have become close friends, and I am indebted to her for her unwavering solidarity. My dear friends Matt and Matt the Doorkeepers, who have looked after me since I entered Parliament, were on duty on the Fridays that my Bill went through the Commons, and I was so pleased that they popped in to see me during their break from Chamber duty. Some people entered into the absolute joy of the occasion and dressed up in Alex’s shark costumes. My wonderful friend Tracey Crouch MP, former Minister for Sport, has been my fantastic friend since she discovered that I share her passion for sport. Tracey dressed up and really got into character by “jawing” everyone who called in. Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP and I served in the Shadow Cabinet together, and we are close friends. John brought his grandson with him, and he dared his grandson to dress up in a shark’s costume, which he did, and John took a photo which he said he would have great delight in circulating to his grandson’s friends! His grandson was really enjoying himself, and he told me I’d made his day. All enjoyed the Welsh Cakes I’d brought from Neath.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the first joint meeting for the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/">Parkinson’s</a>, <a href="https://crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/info-support/become-a-member?gclid=CjwKCAjwtuOlBhBREiwA7agf1rggAM2MuKE8ov2xWdYxSG38jNu_HSzIPTLmoZ6MJo_OiKFfNutXXRoC7sgQAvD_BwE">Crohn’s and Colitis</a>, and <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/">Multiple Sclerosis</a> (MS) APPGs. I am a vice-chair of the MS APPG, a member of the Crohn’s and Colitis APPG, and the secretary of the Parkinson’s APPG. The meeting discussed 10 Years of PIP, the reasons the criteria do not work for claimants, and suggestions for reforms of the system. Over 130,000 people in the UK have MS, about 145,000 live with Parkinson’s, and over 500,00 have Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis. The additional costs in living with these conditions include mobility aids and equipment; treatments; and care. PIP is meant to help manage these extra costs, but many symptoms of these conditions, such as pain, fatigue, incontinence, and cognitive issues, are hidden, and fluctuate from day to day, hour to hour. The present PIP system doesn’t enable people with hidden symptoms to fully explain how their conditions impact on them, and they are denied the help they desperately need. The meeting called on the UK Government to change the following criteria: the arbitrary 20 metre rule – which currently means that if a claimant can walk one metre over this arbitrary figure they can’t receive the highest rate of mobility support; “informal observations” – PIP assessors often make inaccurate decisions made on informal observations- 67% of MS claimants said this did not accurately reflect their situation, and 50% of Parkinson’s said the assessor did not have good knowledge of their condition; the 50% rule – which states that if your symptoms affect you for less than 50% of the month you are not eligible for support; and PIP descriptors should be overhauled to reflect reality.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to attend the event supporting people who use urinary catheters, which many do so as a result of conditions such as MS or spinal cord injuries, to live their lives to the fullest. I met representatives from the <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/">MS Society</a>, <a href="https://www.theurologyfoundation.org/">The Urology Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.spinal.co.uk/">Spinal Injuries Association</a>, <a href="https://www.coloplast.co.uk/">Coloplast UK</a>, and some wonderful people who use indwelling catheters. The objective of the campaign is to get people talking about the challenges and barriers faced by people who use catheters. Most people don’t like to talk about wee or toilet stuff which is still a taboo and embarrassing subject. Despite bladder problems being one of the easiest medical problems to solve, too many suffer in silence. There are over 90,000 people in the UK using indwelling catheters, and an estimated 90,000 use intermittent catheters. Optimal catheter care means the right care for an individual’s needs and provided with information and specialist support, which reduces the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), which occur when the bladder is not fully emptied and lead to discomfort and even hospitalisation. The estimated cost to the NHS is £99 million per annum for catheter associated UTIs. Patients need to be equipped with the correct knowledge and skills if they are to safely undertake intermittent self-catheterisation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1681982288798834688?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">UNISON 2023 Year of Black Workers event</a> to mark the 75th Anniversary of Windrush, celebrating the contributions of the Windrush Generation, and to reflect the work that still remains to be done for those fighting for justice. I pledged to support Patrick Vernon’s campaign to establish “Windrush Day” on 22nd June, which was the day that HMS Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in 1948, carrying over 800 African Caribbean people. Windrush Day will forever remember the contributions of Black Communities, many of whom came to the UK as immigrants. This historic moment has special meaning for UNISON because workers from the Commonwealth helped rebuild public services and transformed our trade unions. Some months ago, I was proud to be shown the UNISON exhibition in their Cardiff Office Building by my dear friend Steve Belcher. The amazing display sets out the history of the trade union, and I still remember how impressed I was with the depth of knowledge and the detail of every part of the story of UNISON, which covers every wall of the entire second floor of the building.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1681574597739843585?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">attend the APPG for NI Reception</a> with my long-time friend Lord Paul Murphy of Torfaen. Paul was very kind and introduced me to many of his Northern Ireland colleagues who had worked with him to secure the 1998 Peace Agreement. Paul is so well respected in Wales, Northern Ireland, and the UK for his measured and co-operative approach to all matters, but this was particularly important when he played such a crucial role in the negotiations between all parties to bring an end to “the Troubles” in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-17/debates/B90B7C1B-2318-4DB9-BB83-9FD25500C8A6/IllegalMigrationBill">main business in the Chamber</a> was the return from the Lords for the second time of the Illegal Migration Bill. Last week we voted to support the Lords in 18 of their Amendments, but the UK Government won every vote. The Bill went back to the Lords who voted to send 9 Amendments back to the Commons in another round of “ping-pong”. We supported all 9 Amendments, but the UK Government again won every vote, before sending the Bill back to the Lords. The UK Government are adamant that the abhorrent measures which include detention for accompanied and unaccompanied children; removal of LGBT people; modern slavery victims access to support; safe and legal routes; and the inadmissibility of migrants claims. The UK Government hasn’t made a single concession on this round of ping-pong, and it is determined that this Bill will become enshrined in law before Parliament breaks up for the summer recess. But this Bill will substantially increase the asylum backlog, putting tens of thousands of people in long-term hotels and asylum accommodation, costing billions. It won’t tackle criminal gangs nor deter boats, it will make it more difficult to get international return agreements, harder to prosecute traffickers, and will lock-up children, pregnant women, and torture victims.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was a PCS retirement reception for its General Secretary, my friend Mark Serwotka, which I managed to pop into for five minutes between votes. Mark was born and brought up in Aberdare to a Polish father and a Welsh mother. He joined PCS on his first day in his first job as a Benefits Clerk in 1979, and became General Secretary of PCS in 2000. After suffering from some heart problems, Mark had a successful heart transplant in 2016. Mark was President of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 2019. I wish Mark a very happy retirement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was privileged to <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1681332794797031426?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">attend the Compassion in Politics APPG</a> to listen to anti-Apartheid activist Dr Mamphela Ramphele to discuss “Why the world needs compassion: Lessons from post-apartheid South Africa” chaired by my dear friend Debbie Abrahams whose partner fled the apartheid regime with his parents when he was 9 years of age. Mamphela is a medical doctor, former vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town, a friend and colleague of the late Nelson Mandela, co-president of the Club of Rome, co-founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, and chair of the Global Compassion Coalition. Mamphela was a partner of the late anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, with whom she had two children. As co-founder of the Black Consciousness Movement and founder of ReimagineSA, Mamphela played a crucial role in the campaign to overturn the apartheid regime in South Africa and has been central to the rebuilding of South Africa (SA) in the decades since. Mamphela spoke about the many occasions she had visited Nelson in prison, and since he was released, including just before he died. She said at the end Nelson was a sad old man because the work he had started to defeat apartheid when he was released from prison in February 1990 had not been taken forward. There is still demarcation in SA because all Africans’ minds are imprisoned. SA is not yet free because what is needed are three pillars – Respect, Fairness and Compassion. But it is a global problem in politics. The ANC has failed to build a platform to deliver because it rejected advice and help from outside experts, and because of jail and exile, don’t know what socio-economic system is needed in SA, so it’s not different from the apartheid system. Most young and older people can’t read or write, and 70% of youngsters are unemployed. GDP and well-being should be driving the SA economy but SA Government not listening. Mamphela also said that the ANC edited Steve Biko out of Nelson’s “Road to Freedom” book.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have been campaigning to <a href="https://bantrophyhunting.org/">ban Trophy Hunting</a> since I became an MP eight years ago. Henry Smith MP has a Private Members’ Bill which passed with all-party support at every stage through the Commons to ban the import and export of trophies, which have been cruelly hacked off defenceless animals that these “hunters” pay thousands of pounds to shoot and kill whilst on a shooting safari abroad. The Bill is now making its way through its stages in the Lords, and at its Second Reading received a very rough ride from Peers on the Tory benches who are members of the “shooting and hunting” brigade. The Bill will be entering its Committee Stage which will be taken in the Lords Chamber sometime in the autumn, and the rumour is that the Tory Lords will table many amendments which will in effect wreck the Bill because the UK Government will not allocate the time needed for all the amendments to be discussed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I dropped into the Visit Britain Delivering growth for the British Economy event to make sure that Visit Wales was playing a part in being promoted as a wonderful place to visit in the UK. The briefing from Visit Britain told us that tourism is a growing sector providing inward investment, jobs, and supporting SMEs in every nation and region. Tourism usually generates £127 billion and supports 3.1 million jobs every year in the UK. The Treasury saw £12 billion income from the visitor economy in 2019. Visit Britain/Visit England funded by £20.1 million (DCMS), Visit Britain – £7.1 million, Visit England – £18.73 million, from Cabinet Office. <a href="https://www.visitwales.com/">Visit Wales</a> is the devolved Welsh Government Tourism Organisation to promote tourism to and in Wales. Tourism is very important to the economy of Wales, and it generates £6.3 billion a year, supporting local businesses, jobs, and SMEs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected vice-chair at the AGM of the <a href="https://rjappg.co.uk/inquiryreport/">Restorative Justice (RJ) APPG</a>, and I look forward to working with chair Elliot Colburn MP, and the Restorative Justice Council to continue to raise awareness of the benefits of RJ. And to lobby the UK Government to adopt and fund RJ throughout all sectors of society.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was humbled to attend the funeral of Violet Poole in Margam Crematorium. Violet was a childhood and university friend of my brother James, who sadly passed away before Christmas. Violet was born and brought up in The Farmer’s Arms Public House in Cefn Cribbw, and my brother was born and brought up in The Walnut Tree Public House in the adjacent village of Kenfig Hill. James kept in touch with Violet over the many years they were friends, and Violet became my friend through my brother. Cllr Huw David from Cefn Cribbw introduced the funeral service. Violet’s granddaughter Anna sang Imagine (John Lennon) live. Violet’s daughters read out Violet’s words about her memories of the Farmer’s Arms, and Cefn; and the poem Stones by Alfred Kreymborg. We sang Calon Lan, and listened to Violet’s favourite “Redemption Song” by Bob Marley. Violet regularly telephoned me, wrote wonderful long letters, and mentored me in many ways when I became involved in politics at a young age. There were many people from all over the world at Violet’s funeral, because she reached out to so many people during her 93 years. I shall never forget her kindness and I shall miss our long chats.</p>

Many of my constituents think that the BBC licence fee is an outdated, regressive tax, and question why they should have to fund a broadcaster that they do not support and do not want to watch.
If a formal review of the BBC’s funding model is indeed to take place in the autumn, surely abolishing…

<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has praised the impact of a voluntary group in West Dunbartonshire helping to provide door-to-door transport for vulnerable residents.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064785753378">West Dunbartonshire Community Transport</a> (WDCT) was established in 2019 to help reduce social isolation by working with community groups, and improve health outcomes by helping people to health appointments.</p>



<p>The volunteer-led group runs a free Health Appointment Transport Scheme for residents across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven – helping people with essential journeys including GP and hospital visits.</p>



<p>The area’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes met with community transport volunteers during a visit in Dumbarton, and is supporting a recruitment drive for volunteer drivers.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“I have been really impressed by the work of the volunteers at West Dunbartonshire Community Transport (WDCT). They are providing a valuable service for residents who would otherwise find it challenging to travel for essential healthcare appointments.</p>



<p>“The free community transport initiative particularly benefits vulnerable people; helping to tackle social isolation and improve health outcomes.</p>



<p>“I was delighted to catch-up with the team at WDCT and hope to see them serving the communities of West Dunbartonshire for years to come.</p>



<p>“The charity’s community driver scheme is currently on the lookout for volunteers – I’d encourage anyone interested in volunteering to get in touch.”</p>



<p><em><strong>If you’d like to book transport with WDCT – or are interested in helping out as a volunteer driver – you can contact the charity by email on <a href="mailto:wdctag@gmail.com">wdctag@gmail.com</a> or call 07990 825 754.</strong></em></p>

<p>This week I raised the issue of Andover&#8217;s Levelling Up Fund bid with the Deputy Prime Minister at PMQs. </p>



<p>When you apply for a PMQ you enter a ballot along with every other member and so you have about a 1 in 400 chance of getting a question. This week I was lucky to be picked, although the Prime Minister was away at the NATO summit, so his Deputy Answered. </p>

			<p>Oldham East and Saddleworth MP Debbie Abrahams marked World Wellbeing Week this week by calling for people’s wellbeing to be a key objective of Government, and not just economic growth.</p>
<p>The theme of 2023’s world wellbeing week is anxiety.</p>
<p>Before being elected as the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Ms Abrahams was a public health consultant focusing on health inequalities and Chair of an NHS Trust.</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams MP said:</p>
<p>“World Wellbeing Week is a chance for policymakers to reflect on the centrality of wellbeing in policy decision-making. For too long, policies have chased economic growth at all costs, without considering the importance of the wellbeing of people. Most importantly, we must focus on the equity of this wellbeing – being working 3 jobs while still being poor, cold and hungry will clearly not contribute to people’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>“This year’s theme is anxiety, which is particularly relevant given last week’s rise in interest rates. Constituents across Oldham East and Saddleworth have been in touch with me to express their anxiety about the impact of this on their household finances, and how for many this has increased their anxiety.</p>
<p>“The World Wellbeing Movement has set a challenge to Governments but also local authorities, businesses, schools and individuals to think ‘beyond GDP’ as a success measure, and to look at what gives us fulfilment and enjoyment – our relationships, our green spaces and so on. I hope you can join this movement to a greater enjoyment and fulfilment.”</p>

<p><strong>As many people die from preventable hip fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes, Judith Cummins MP has revealed.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking on Tuesday in the House of Commons, Bradford South MP Judith Cummins called on the Government to step up its game on bone fracture prevention and save lives.</p>



<p>Judith has been vocal on the issue of Osteoporosis, which affects half of all women and a fifth of all men over 50. It is characterised by a loss of bone density, leaving people vulnerable to breaks and fractures. Because symptoms often aren’t noticed until a serious break, osteoporosis has been called the ‘silent disease’.</p>



<p>Raising the issue in Parliament, Judith highlighted the shocking reality of the condition:</p>



<p>‘Many of these will be serious hip fractures, and as many people will die from these fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes.’</p>



<p>Questioning the Minister, Judith asked why such a serious condition is so often overlooked in healthcare:</p>



<p>‘Can the Minister explain why not even one of the 63 key performance indicators set by NHS England for Integrated Care Boards sets a target for fracture prevention?’</p>



<p>Responding, Maria Caulfield MP, Minister for Women’s Health Strategy, thanked Judith for her longstanding work on bone health. The Minister also highlighted measures the Government is undertaking to tackle Osteoporosis:</p>



<p>‘NHS England is expanding fracture services for higher risk women who do have Osteoporosis to prevent falls in the first place.’</p>



<p>Despite the Government’s claims to be stepping up fracture services, the limits of the current services mean that 74,000 preventable fractures will occur over the next five years, costing the NHS £665 million.</p>



<p>Making fracture prevention a key performance target could lead to stronger delivery of these services, preventing unnecessary pain, giving patients the level of care they deserve, and saving vital NHS resources.</p>



<p>Following the exchange, Judith said that Government support for fracture prevention was still inadequate:</p>



<p>‘Whilst Bradford offers a trailblazing service for those with Osteoporosis, this is not always the case nationally.’</p>



<p>‘The argument for investing in the prevention of fractures is clear: To save money and save lives, we need a government with the sense to invest in the future of women’s health in this country.’</p>

<p>The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking after the visit <strong>Matt Warman MP commented</strong> ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith</strong> who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’</p>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

First of all, thank you to everyone who has sent such kind messages to me after last night’s result in Birmingham Northfield.

<br />
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.<br />
<br />
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.<br />
<br />
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.<br />
<br />
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.<br />
<br />
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.<br />
<br />
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.<br />
<br />
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.<br />
<br />
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.<br />
<br />
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.<br />
<br />
We have a historic debt of honour to them.<br />

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br />

I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br />
<br />
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br />
<br />
Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br />
<br />
<i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br />
<br />
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br />
<br />
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br />
<br />
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br />
