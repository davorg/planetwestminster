<p>South Lakes MP Tim Farron will lead a debate in Parliament tomorrow on the housing crisis in rural communities caused by the rise in second homes and holiday lets.</p>
<p>In South Lakeland there has been a 32% increase in the number of holiday lets in the district over the past year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a meeting of the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority last year heard that 3,100 of the national park's 12,000 properties were now holiday lets and second homes.</p>
<p>In the debate, Tim will make the case for ministers to change planning law so that local authorities have the power to limit the number of second homes in a community.</p>
<p>Tim's Backbench Business Debate, which is supported by Conservative, SNP, DUP and Plaid Cymru MPs, will take place in Westminster Hall from 1.30pm.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"Holiday lets can provide great economic benefit to the local area and of course people are entitled to buy a second home, but the need for families to have a home of their own must come first.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Here in the Lake District, we've seen a disturbing rise in people being evicted from their home so their landlord can make a quick buck putting it on AirBnB.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"The Government cannot be allowed to sit on their hands for any longer while our communities are turned into ghost towns.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Tomorrow, we need ministers to commit to giving local councils the power to say when enough is enough."</em>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish and Shadow Public Health Minister, has stated that he is ‘deeply concerned’ after receiving news that Tameside Hospital and 16 others across Greater Manchester are postponing non-urgent surgery and appointments.</p>
<p>The decision was taken by the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership late last night, as a result of the ‘high and rising’ level of staff absences due to COVID 19.</p>
<p><strong>In a statement, Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“I am deeply concerned by the news that non-urgent elective care is now paused across Greater Manchester at a number of hospitals. The impact of Omicron on our NHS is clear, and patients will understandably feel very anxious about planned operations, and when they will receive care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This news compounds an NHS backlog that was already at record levels before the pandemic began. I urge the Government to be honest about the pressure that the NHS is under, and outline what actions they will be taking to support staff, and ensure that local hospitals are able to guarantee patient safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Shadow Public Health Minister, I am monitoring the situation closely alongside the Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting, and we will be raising the situation as a matter of urgency in the Commons today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also just like to take a moment to thank out NHS staff who are working extraordinarily hard to try and keep the show on the road in the face of unprecedented challenges.”</p></blockquote>

              <h3>John Redwood (Wokingham)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Some contributors asked me to say more about our growing import dependence. The UK has been a net importer of electricity since the second quarter of 2010. In the last century we had a policy of security of supply and national self sufficiency. The latest government quarterly report for the third quarter of 2021 stated that the net imports of 7.6TWh for that period was the &#8220;highest value ever&#8221;. Imports reached 8.4 TWh whilst exports were 0.8 TWh. Our main exports are to Ireland which took 0.8TWh over the three months. The biggest single source of imported power is France, followed by the Netherlands. One of the reasons for the increase in imports was the poor performance of wind power.</p>
<p>Scotland which usually supplies substantial power into England from its large windfarms supplied 50% less in the third quarter. Scottish wind farms are given priority to supply when they are up and running, taking precedence over England based gas plants in accordance with the decarbonisation policy.</p>
<p>Fuel imports from the EU rose by 50% in the third quarter  on a small base and imports from the rest of the world rose by 34% on a larger base. The UK also exported some fuel to the EU over that time period.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to support the proposition that the UK has a good business exporting wind based energy to the continent at scale when the wind blows well. The French system is usually well supplied by nuclear power, whilst continental wind farms also tend to do well when the wind is blowing across northern  Europe as a whole. The danger is when there is plenty of wind market prices for surplus power are often low.</p>
<p>So the questions to ask  are</p>
<ol>
<li>Why have we allowed ourselves to become so dependent on imported electricity from Europe, when the continent is short of gas and oil, wishing to close down its coal activities and dependent on Russian gas? What are the prospects for French nuclear given the age of the fleet and the high replacement costs and delays in construction?</li>
<li>How central is security of supply in policy formation?</li>
<li>What is the relative cost of wind power and gas generated electricity given the need for more back up power for wind provision and adjusting for priority access to customers afforded to wind power?</li>
<li> When could we become a serious exporter of electricity making a profit from the transaction in  the way some argue we could?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>It is with a deep sense of regret that for the second year in a row, my letter at the turn of a New Year cannot but focus on the coronavirus pandemic. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Like all of us one year ago, when the first doses of the vaccine were being rolled out, I hoped that these jabs and the unfortunate restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the Delta variant would be the final push towards defeating covid from our lives. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Sadly, the virus has mutated, putting an end to any such hopes this winter. I write ahead of the Christmas break, and I am mindful that we are still unsure of the impact of the Omicron variant on cases, hospitalisations and deaths. But it is a clear reminder that covid is still with us for the foreseeable future. I urge everyone to get their booster jab as soon as they are eligible, to help protect our community this year. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Looking back over the past year, it is remarkable that we have gone from administering the first approved dose of the vaccine anywhere in the world last December, to over 120 million doses administered now, one million of which have been in Shropshire. This has been in no small part thanks to the remarkable efforts of NHS staff, and the hard work of our local GPs and Primary Care Network staff and volunteers here in South Shropshire, to whom we should be very grateful. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Despite all the havoc wreaked on the Parliamentary timetable in 2020, the past 12 months have been a busy time in Westminster, with several landmark pieces of legislation passing into law. The first serious effort in decades to reform funding of social care was a landmark moment.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For me, perhaps the most significant was the Environment Act. There are many reasons for this, given it is such a wide-ranging piece of legislation, covering plastic waste, pollinators, ancient woodlands, a new Office for Environmental Protection, and air and water quality targets - all helping us to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But it also represented the culmination of my long running campaign to introduce legislation to reduce sewage pollution into our rivers. After pressing the government hard to take action on this issue, supported by many campaigning organisations, including the Rivers Trust, Angling Trust and Surfers Against Sewage, I am delighted that we secured a legal duty on water companies progressively to reduce the impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows, which contains the essence of what I have been campaigning for since the 2019 General Election.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This is not the end of sewage pollution, and I will continue to do all I can to keep up the fight. But the progress we made this year was the most meaningful step forward on this issue in decades. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Over the next year, I expect the government to progress further in delivering on its manifesto commitments, though the immediate need to combat the pandemic will continue to be the primary focus. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Environmental Audit Committee will continue our work holding government to account for its environmental commitments, including those made at COP26 in November last year. We have a number of inquiries underway, including examining how HM Treasury could incorporate environmental sustainability into its leading measures of the UK’s economic success. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I remain happy to engage with constituents on these and any other issues of concern, and the best way to contact me is via email at <a href="mailto:philip.dunne.mp@parliament.uk">philip.dunne.mp@parliament.uk</a>. I wish everyone in South Shropshire a Happy New Year, with best wishes for 2022. </span></span></span></p>

<p>As we look to the New Year, I doubt the government is short on advice for dealing with the many problems we face.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister isn&#8217;t exactly entering the year in a blaze of glory.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s alienated his own MPs, fallen out with the voters and is beginning to look like a loser as well someone who struggles with facts and truth.</p>



<p>I doubt he&#8217;s interested in advice from me, and to be honest there&#8217;s no love lost between us, but for the benefit of all, I feel obliged to point out an area where, if the government acted now, there could be winners all round.</p>



<p>For more than three months energy prices have been rising steadily.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s led to 30 companies going bust, forcing customers onto new suppliers who are charging them even higher tariffs.</p>



<p>The bills won&#8217;t be coming down anytime soon and Ofgem, the regulator established to protect consumers, has announced it&#8217;s planning to raise the cap in April.</p>



<p>Some experts predict increases of 40%, taking household bills to unimaginable levels.</p>



<p>Against this background Labour called, last October, for the Chancellor to cut VAT for six months over the winter period. He refused, despite both he and the Prime Minister having campaigned to cut VAT on fuel if we voted to leave the EU.</p>



<p>Other European countries are cutting taxes right now but despite 5% of all that money we&#8217;re forced to spend heating and lighting our homes going straight to the Treasury, the Chancellor refuses to act.</p>



<p>New figures uncovered by Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves have revealed that he&#8217;s anticipating a £3.1 billion bonus because of the huge price increases.</p>



<p>If he were to cut VAT, for at least the remaining three months of the winter, it would only cost him around £0.5 billion but have a huge impact on families already struggling with rises in food, rent and travel costs.</p>



<p>This government is earning a reputation for always being too slow to act. Why not start the year by doing something we can all agree on and from which everyone would benefit?</p>



<p>Happy New Year!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p><strong>This extract from an article by Tom Calver was published in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-alternative-honours-sunday-times-heroes-of-2021-mn2cjg6zh" target="_blank">The Times</a></em>.</strong></p>



<p>Every six months, committees of civil servants and independent experts pore through thousands of applications to decide who will receive an honour from the Queen.</p>



<p>Under the leadership of Sir Tom Scholar, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, a list is compiled of who has “made achievements in public life” and “committed themselves to serving and helping Britain”. Anyone can be nominated for an award in the Queen’s birthday and new year lists. Yet the reasons why an application succeeds are kept secret.</p>



<p>Of the 1,239 chosen last Christmas, 803 were recognised for work in the community. But some high-profile appointments, critics argue, call into question the integrity of the process. Others warn that the system gives an advantage to those willing to pay.</p>



<p>Mark&nbsp;Llewellyn-Slade, a public relations expert, runs Awards Intelligence, a company that advises people on how to be nominated for honours. Its website says: “The average success rate is estimated to be just 10 per cent (1 in 10). Our success rate is over 65 per cent (nearly 2 in 3).”</p>



<p>He said: “Other than accusations of ‘cash for honours’ by wealthy political donors on a few occasions, I don’t believe the honours system is being misused.”</p>



<p>In a year when sleaze, second jobs and cash-for-honours scandals have rocked the public’s faith in British institutions, what could a better honours system look like?</p>



<p><strong>John Penrose, a Conservative MP who is Boris Johnson’s anti-corruption “champion”, wants the system replaced with a points-based “UK talent list”. He said the existing honours gave too much weight to those in government jobs.</strong></p>



<p>“T<strong>he system should match the number of public, private and charitable sector jobs in our economy, so people in government jobs aren’t over-represented while less visible ones get overlooked,” he said.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Transparency was vital, he added. “The points would have to be won because of concrete, visible achievements that everyone can see and measure, so the playing field can’t be tilted by politics or favouritism either. That might mean the best educators would be the heads whose schools improved the most. The top entrepreneurs would be people who built the biggest firms, or created the most jobs. The leading philanthropists would have given the biggest donations. Money for political parties shouldn’t count.”</strong></p>



<p>One day the honours system may be decided through data, but there is not yet enough publicly available information to make those decisions. Instead The Sunday Times has this year turned to its own specialists, who have been writing about the unsung heroes of sport, science, healthcare, justice and the arts all year.</p>



<p>Not all will agree with our choices; nor is the list exclusive. But it is a record of who we think should be celebrated this year — and, crucially, why.</p>



<p>The recipients of our 2021 People’s Honours include role models who have inspired children, and campaigners from a range of backgrounds who have fought to make Britain fairer and safer. Many have made enormous personal sacrifices to save lives and livelihoods. While some are prominent, many have been quietly working away during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Often in the worst of times, we see the best of people. That&#8217;s especially true in our communities, where, every day, we see people doing incredible work. In fact, they are so busy helping others it is sometimes too easy to forget just how special they are.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to celebrate some of these heroes in Parliament &#8211; and where it has been safe to do so, meet with them, and thank them, in person.  But there are many more, the unsung majority &#8211; you will know a few of them yourselves. You may even be one of them but don&#8217;t even think about it.</p>
<p>To them all, I say thank you.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, no better example of the best of our communities than the MFR Cash for Kids Christmas Appeal.</p>
<p>People across the Highlands came together to ensure every local child had a gift to open on Christmas day.</p>
<p>The incredible Cash for Kids team worked flat out to deliver all the gifts across the Highlands &#8211; and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>They were supported by local fundraisers, businesses, volunteers, and all of you, who took the time to buy a gift that is sure to have put a smile on a child’s face on Christmas day, not to mention offer some slight relief to struggling parents.</p>
<p>It is heart-warming to imagine the weight lifted off families and the smile on the face of their child – even if it was just for one day.</p>
<p>Especially when more families than ever before are facing a tough time.</p>
<p>Along with amazing local charities, foodbanks and community volunteers, my team and I are doing all we can to help as well as continuing to urge the UK Government to change course.</p>
<p>But the reality is, the UK Government know the impact of the choices they are making, these are deliberate actions.</p>
<p>With its limited powers over Social Security the Scottish Government is showing different choices can be made by putting dignity and respect at the heart of policy.</p>
<p>What better place to start building a Social Security system ensuring every child has a fair start in life?</p>
<p>As we look ahead to 2022, I hope this is a statement of intent on which we can all agree.</p>
<p>To you and your family, from me, my family, and my team, I wish you a Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Last year- December 15 2020, an electrical fire damaged Ashley Court in Hatfield. Residents, a number of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site in temporary accommodation since the incident.</p>
<p>Sanctuary have handed over control of the site to a construction team to restore the block, but earlier this year residents were shocked to find that they were being charged £225 per month in service charges to the Housing Association.</p>
<p>Residents, who are still not able to come back to Ashley Court, are being charged for a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, alarm rental and monitoring, ground maintenance, water rates, electricity , internal maintenance, waste disposal, lift, laundry equipment, building insurance, internal maintenance and window cleaning. All of which they are not able to get any benefit from.</p>
<p>After the fire, security guards were in place to guard the property. However, they were removed after a short amount of time and a number of flats were broken into this September, with personal items stolen.</p>
<p>Cllr Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, contacted Sanctuary about this issue in October, asking them to look again at this situation and stop demanding payment from the displaced residents.</p>
<p>Sanctuary responded to Cllr Hebden’s letter, but did not agree to waive the £225 p/m charge on the residents.</p>
<p>Now, Mr Shapps has written a letter (below) Sanctuary Housing’s CEO Craig Moule about this issue to reiterate the need for this charge to be waived, and for residents to be refunded.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Of the case, Cllr Peter Hebden said: “The response I received from Sanctuary Housing was very disappointing and didn’t address the issues from the residents’ perspective at all. This is now the 2nd Christmas that residents will be away from their homes and that is totally unacceptable. Sanctuary Housing need to seriously review their approach as to how they manage major incidents such as this and keep the residents at the forefront of their plans. They have shown little understanding and compassion for the terrible time the residents have gone through.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “The residents of Ashley Court have been away from their homes for a year now- living with friends, family and in other temporary accommodation through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>“It does not seem fair that they are having to shell out cash for lifts and equipment that isn’t being used, for waste disposal when they aren’t living there, and for a caretaker and window cleaning on a building that is essentially a building site.</p>
<p>“So I’m hoping that the CEO of Sanctuary Housing will agree with myself and Cllr Hebden, and put the minds of the Ashley Court residents at ease by waiving these charges.”<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p></div>

<p>My week in Westminster began when I joined the Wales All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Hospitality, Events, and Major Food and Drink Businesses, chaired by Jess Morden MP, to receive an update from many guest speakers involved in this very important sector in Wales.</p>
<p>David Chapman, Executive Director for Wales UK Hospitality introduced the discussion by highlighting the recruitment crisis in the sector. Staffing is 30% down on 2020 levels because of, amongst other things, less migrant workers, end of the furlough scheme and business rates relief (England), the increase in VAT from 5 to 12.5% on 1st October 2021, which will go up to 20% on 1st April 2022, competition from other sectors that have more regular working hours, and staff isolating because of Covid regulations. Staff that have loyally remained in the sector are suffering from mental health issues and anxiety due to overwork because they are covering other members of staff duties.</p>
<p>The Group Task and Development Director at Celtic Manor Group, which consists of seven hotels and venues, spoke about the high level of vacancies she has in both permanent and casual posts. Many who left in March 2020 have not returned, and that it’s now a candidates market because of staff shortages, so candidates dictate and negotiate the terms of their employment. And even though all roles have received increased wages, many are still leaving for jobs with slightly higher rates of pay.</p>
<p>The Welsh Rarebit Collective represents 200 independent hotels and its representative said that the lack of staff has never been so bad in the Wales hospitality sector. Many of his members have to turn away business because of lack of staff. He had conducted a straw poll amongst his members and only 11% are running at full capacity, whilst 80% are turning away business.</p>
<p>The speakers also agreed that there was a perception in the UK that a job in the hospitality sector was something that is fitted in between school and university, or a temporary job until securing a “proper” career, rather than being viewed as a genuine career itself. And that one of the major challenges is to change this culture, which should begin in schools and colleges.</p>
<p>I dropped in to the Women’s Aid photo session which was held to promote their #DeserveToBeHeard campaign supporting women who have suffered domestic abuse and the barriers they have faced when seeking help. I pledged to #HearHer. Please read more – Mental Health and Domestic Abuse – by Women’s Aid. Reframing the Links: Black and minorities women, domestic violence, and abuse, and mental health- A Review of the Literature – by Ravi Thiara and Christine Harrison University of Warwick.</p>
<p>The APPG for Rare, Genetic, and Undiagnosed Conditions joined with the APPG for Life Sciences Diseases, jointly chaired by Liz Twist MP and Daniel Zeichner MP, to discuss the UK Rare Diseases Framework. This is an important piece of policy development which will change the landscape for people affected by rare conditions. Whilst the population of an individual rare disease is small, there are over seven thousand identified rare conditions, consequently one in seventeen will be affected by a rare condition at sometime in their lives which equates to 3.5 million in the UK and three quarters of all rare diseases affect children. It is estimated that these rare diseases are responsible for about a third of infant mortality in the UK and it takes about four years to be diagnosed with a rare condition. But licensed medical products are only available for a small minority of rare diseases, making it very difficult for patients to access potentially life saving treatment. The Framework was released in January 2021. The guest speakers discussed the development of the UK Government Action Plans that will implement the Framework, and will be announced at the beginning of next year. These Action Plans are vital in leading systemic change so that people with rare diseases are given the care they need.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the Second Delegated Legislation Committee which discussed the Draft Solvency 2 (Group Supervision) (Amendment) Regulations 2021. The draft instrument was made to address deficiencies in retained EU Law. It will ensure that an equivalence decision which assesses that the insurance group supervision regime in another country is equivalent to that in the UK and avoids duplication of supervisory work in relation to insurance groups. HM Treasury explain that the purpose is to ensure that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) where it is group supervisor of a UK insurance group with a parent in a third country, including the EU, can defer to the supervisory authority in that third country in certain circumstances, if the insurance group supervision regime in the third country has been assessed as equivalent to the UK‘s regime. HMT says that these changes will avoid unnecessary duplication, reduce regulatory compliance cost for UK insurance groups, reduce supervisory cost for the PRA, and reduce the need for co-ordination between third country supervisor authorities and the PRA. The members of the committee debated the draft instrument which was passed unanimously without a division.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup> December I attended the APPG Wales and the World, chaired by Craig Williams MP for Montgomeryshire, and attended by Simon Baynes MP, Liz Saville-Roberts MP, Robin Millar MP, and Ben Lake MP. The meeting was addressed by Megan Williams, who runs the Welsh North American Association. Megan explained how the Association was set up and since 1929 has organised an annual Gymanfa Ganu. It currently has 2500 members, publishes the Ninnau Newspaper and has links with Welsh Associations across America and the World, including the Welsh Society of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As a member of the Petitions Committee I was selected to lead a Westminster Hall Petition Debate on 13th December, on behalf petitioner Richard Ackers who set up Justice for Reggie, following the death of his puppy Reggie from Parvovirus within a few days of buying Reggie from an online seller. Richard’s petition, which closed with over 109,000 signatures, calls for regulating all websites where animals are sold, including verification of sellers’ identity and pictures of animals for sale with their parents. Ahead of the debate I held a virtual round table to gather evidence from animal welfare organisations about online advertising of the sale of animals. I met with the Dogs Trust, RSPCA, Cats Protection, British Veterinary Association, Kennel Club, and the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) so that I could include their perspective on the aim of the petition.</p>
<p>I held a separate virtual meeting with the petitioner Richard Ackers and learned how he and his family were heartbroken following the death of his puppy Reggie, and he was outraged to find out that there were no regulations covering UK online animal sale advertising, after buying Reggie, who was advertised on an online website from an allegedly reputable seller. Richard set up his petition to prevent others being duped by disreputable sellers. Read the debate <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/159543/regulation-of-online-animal-sales-to-be-debated-by-mps/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I joined the Western Gateway APPG co-chaired by Jess Morden MP and Mark Harper MP for an update on the Western Gateway partnership whose aims are – connecting communities, championing businesses, creating opportunities for sustainable growth, and bringing together businesses, academia, and governments across the River Severn to work together to attract new opportunities for the 4.4 million people living in this region. Its “Step Fusion” bid could provide a near limitless source of low carbon energy that produces four million times more energy than every kilogram of fuel than burning coal, oil, or gas. Fusion doesn’t emit harmful toxins like carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and nuclear fusion reactors provide no high activity, long-lived nuclear waste. It will be situated at Severn Edge because this site once led the world in the development of nuclear power production, is in the levelling-up areas of England and Wales, and close to many Welsh communities identified by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) left-behind index. It can tap into the local massive supply chain, the UK’s National fusion laboratory at Culham, Bristol University high temperature engineering expertise, and nearby R &amp; D facilities. I look forward to the Western Gateway Powerhouse Conference next year.</p>
<p>I attended the APPG for Down Syndrome online meeting following the Second Reading of the Down Syndrome (England) Private Members’ Bill tabled by Liam Fox MP. The APPG was co-chaired by Lisa Cameron MP and Matt Western MP. Liam Fox said that his Bill was in the “Write Around” stage where all UK Government Departments can pledge their support and can add conditions before the Bill goes into committee, where it will be debated and can be amended. Mr Fox hopes that his Bill will pass through the Lords in one day. We heard very powerful, positive, statements from husband and wife, James and Heidi Carter, who support the Bill, and have Down Syndrome. This absolutely charming, happy, couple told us that it “Doesn’t Define Me”. James said that he works hard to support his wife and has a few jobs. Heidi said that James was very handsome, and they love each other very much.</p>
<p>The Co-operative Parliamentary Group met in person on Wednesday afternoon to listen to Rose Marley, CEO of Co-operatives UK, but unfortunately, as soon as the meeting began the division bell, rang summoning MPs to the voting lobby. Consequently, the Co-operative Party Officers Joe Fortune, General Secretary, Emma Hoddinott, Assistant General Secretary, and Rob Bates, Political and Parliamentary Officer, decided that instead of holding a formal meeting, it was turned into a sort of informal drop-in event where MPs called in to speak with Rose and the officers, between the series of votes which lasted most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Chairman of Ways and Means, Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing MP,  who is in charge of the Panel of Parliamentary Chairs convened our Autumn Meeting. We paid tribute to our colleague Sir David Amess MP who was tragically murdered, and held a minute silence. We discussed the forward plan for 2022 covering the responsibilities covered by all the chairs: Public Bill Committees, General Committees, Westminster Hall Debates, and Delegated Legislation Committees. Plus the rules of behaviour and courtesies in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Lord Colin Moynihan co-chair (with the late Sir David Amess) of the APPG for Olympics and Paralympics convened a special AGM of the APPG to pay tribute to Sir David, who, as I have already mentioned, was tragically murdered last month, and to elect a new co-chair to succeed David. I was so proud and honoured to be unanimously elected as co-chair, and pledged to do my very best to continue to work with the members of the APPG in memory of David, who was a dear friend to me, and who helped me so much when I was a newly elected MP. David and I became close friends and we shared a passion for all types of sport. He had a wonderful mischievous nature, a dry sense of humour, and was always happy. David loved to tease me and I miss him more each day.</p>
<p>On Friday, I was back in my constituency at the (socially distanced) switching on of the Melin Christmas Lights at Melin Community Trust, by Neath Town Councillor Keith Finn, who represents the Melyn Ward. There was a good crowd who turned up to support the Trust, and listen to Keith make his debut speech, which was superb. Melin Trust was set up in 2002 to foster community development and regeneration in local areas. It is run by staff, trustees and, over the years, hundreds of volunteers have gained skills and confidence by taking part in the many projects run by the Trust. At the Christmas Lights ceremony, the Trust volunteers handed out mince pies and there was genuine delight at seeing so many old friends in person again after such a long time.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, I joined the virtual meeting of the Wales Co-operative Council to present my report on the work of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. We have continued work on increasing protection for retail workers as they face increasing levels of violence, threats, and abuse at work. The UK Government has finally conceded to our campaign, led in the Commons by Alex Norris MP and his Private Members’ Bill. It will be bringing forward a U.K. Government Lords amendment that gives greater protection for all public-facing workers, including retail workers to the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill, which is currently in the Lords. This has been a core campaign for the Parliamentary Group, the wider Co-operative movement, and trade unions for many years, but we shall continue to press the UK Government to ensure the proposed legislation has the desired positive impact on retail workers.</p>
<p>I have been leading the campaign for the introduction of a UK Marcora Law that would give workers and employees the opportunity, the financial support, and advice, to buy-out all or part of their employer’s business when it is in crisis, and establish it as an employee-owned co-operative. In Italy this is done by giving workers their employment benefits as a lump sum advance to use as capital for the buy-out, plus support and advice from the Cooperazione Finanza Impresa (CFI) which runs Marcora Law on behalf of the Italian Government, to make sure buy-outs are successful. Following my Marcora Law Westminster Hall Debate on 8th September, Camillo De Berardinis Presidente of CFI, contacted me to say that he’d watched my debate and invited me to speak at the CFI’s 35th Anniversary, which I was honoured to accept. I shall continue to press the UK Government to introduce a UK Marcora Law and I have a 10-Minute Rule Bill entitled “Co-operatives (Employee Company Ownership) scheduled in the Commons for 11th January.</p>
<p>We have been actively opposing the sell-off of LV= one of Britain’s oldest and largest customer-owned business. The APPG for Mutuals, chaired by Gareth Thomas MP, of which I am treasurer, conducted an inquiry into the proposed sell-off of LV= and our report stated that the proposed sale to American venture capitalist firm Bain Capital would mean millions of LV= customers losing their ownership rights and ability to have a say in the company’s decisions. I’m pleased to report that LV= members have blocked the takeover, scuppering a year long campaign by the LV= board to secure backing for its preferred bidder Bain. Only 69% of the 174,240 members who cast ballots on 10th December approved of the £530m takeover, but the necessary threshold is 75%. LV= said that it would work swiftly to reassess its options, which could be merging with fellow mutual Royal London, one of the rival bidders, whose initial bid wasn’t accepted by the LV= board, despite being a higher bid at £540m, compared with Bain’s £530m. Gareth called for Chief Executive Mark Hartigan and Chairman Alan Cook to resign immediately. LV= confirmed that Mr Cook would be stepping down, but have not specified a date.</p>
<p>Week beginning 13th December</p>
<p>On Monday 13th I was honoured and privileged to present Reggie’s Law on behalf of the petitioner Richard Ackers, who had been given special permission by the Chair of Ways and Means to be present in the public gallery, because visitors are not allowed on the Parliamentary Estate under current Covid regulations. I told MPs that Richard started the petition after he bought his 12 week old Labrador puppy Reggie through a reputable website for his partner for Christmas and then realised that he had unknowingly contributed to illegal puppy farming. Richard concedes that he should have done more research before buying Reggie, and should have walked away, which would have prevented the seller getting more money to continue with acts of animal cruelty, but Reggie would still have died. Richard gave Reggie love, dignity, and pain relief throughout his very short life. Reggie fell ill 12 hours after Richard took him home and he died from Parvovirus two days later. Richard thought that Reggie was from St Helens, but when he returned to the seller’s address, the house was empty. Richard discovered that the microchip number for Reggie did not match the documentation given to Richard and it was registered to Dublin. Richard thinks Reggie was illegally shipped to the UK. Richard’s petition gathered over 109,000 signatures and many MPs attended the debate to support Reggie’s Law, and tell their stories of their constituents who had been duped by online sellers, plus tragic cases of mistreatment of animals. The UK Government Parliamentary Minister, Under-Secretary of State for Agri-Innovation and Climate Adaption Jo Churchill MP, was very sympathetic and offered to meet Richard. I summed up the debate by thanking all members for their contributions and urged the Minister to legislate to prevent people suffering the heartbreak that Richard has, and I thanked Richard for his determination not to give up on Justice For Reggie.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 14th I spoke in a Westminster Hall Debate on the contribution of co-operative and mutual societies to the economy and public life. I took the opportunity to continue to highlight my campaign to press the UK Government to introduce a UK Marcora Law. I started by reminding members that Robert Owen, founder of our Co-operative movement, whose vision included villages of co-operation, a “New World Order” of mutual help and social equality, was born in Wales, in Newtown, Powys on 14th May 1771. Also that the Co-op Group can trace its roots back to the start of modern co-operation in Rochdale in 1844, and that 177 years later, the Group continues to put its members and their passions at the centre of its business with a focus on working with others – co-operating. And since it’s launch in 2016, the Group’s Local Community Fund has provided approaching £100m to over 20,000 local good causes, making it one of the largest funding mechanisms for charities in the UK. I told the Minister that too much power and wealth rest with a small number of investors, shareholders, and executives and that decisions are often made for the benefit of the powerful and wealthy, not for the benefit of communities, workers, consumers, and the environment. And that I believe the answer lies in Marcora Law. I referred to my Westminster Hall Debate on 8th September and provided Minister John Glen MP with more facts about the success of the Italian New Marcora Law operated by the CFI, but the Minister repeated his comments that he made in my debate, that the Italian economy is different to the UK, And the unemployment rate is higher in Italy.</p>
<p>But the Minister did offer to meet me to discuss Marcora Law, and I have written to him to request a meeting in the New Year.</p>
<p>As the vice-chair for the APPG Rail in Wales, I was delighted to be asked to chair the Zoom meeting to discuss “Women in Rail” (WIR) with guest speakers Christine Fernandez, Development Lead CAF and chair of WIR Wales, and Gemma Southgate, Social Media Manager TfW and committee member of WIR Wales. Christine and Gemma gave a joint presentation about the aims and objectives of WIR Wales, the role of women in rail, and the need for more women to work in a variety of roles across the rail sector. There are only 13% women in the Rail sector, and only 2-3% are drivers. Women in Rail was set up to create various initiatives to encourage more women to join the sector, including a mentoring programme, upskilling, a peer to peer network for senior women in rail, an EDI Charter, and has plans to engage with schools, colleges and apprenticeships.</p>
<p>As a member of the Panel of Chairs, I chaired Westminster Hall Debates on both Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday Sir Tony Lloyd MP, former Shadow Northern Ireland Shadow Cabinet Minister, led a debate on securing a veterinary agreement in the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sir Tony opened by taking us back to two years ago quoting Prime Minister Johnson who said about form-filling “tell them to ring up the Prime Minister and I will direct them to throw the form in the bin….there will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind. You will have unfettered access.” Sir Tony said that his debate was about the operation of the protocol, and it is irresponsible that two years on we have no solution, which is building up tensions and concerns in Northern Island. Sir Tony stated that we need to move on – to some form of trusted trader scheme.</p>
<p>The next debate was led by Ruth Cadbury MP and was about the Free Period Product Scheme for Schools and College in England. Ruth is chair of the APPG on Period Equality, and she welcomed the UK Government’s announcement on 26th November to extend the scheme for all of 2022. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education, Will Quince, responded by stating that people may think “what does this middle-aged bloke know or care about period products?” But he does care because he is passionate about ensuring that women and girls are supported in education and beyond.</p>

<p>On Thursday I chaired a three hour Back Bench Debate about preventing surgical fires in the NHS led by Jim Shannon MP who underlined the serious dangers of surgical fires to patients and clinicians. A surgical fire occurs in an operating theatre and has three elements: the ignition source, the fuel and the oxidiser. Ignition sources include electro-surgical units, fibre-optic light sources, and lasers. Fuels can be alcohol-based skin prepping agents used in excess. The oxidiser is an oxygen-rich environment in which nitrous oxide is also present.</p>
<p>Mr Shannon stated that the debate was about raising awareness and making sure that surgical fires no longer happen. Mr Shannon stated that nobody knows how common surgical fires are, because there is a large discrepancy between reporting across the UK and health is devolved. The UK Government accept there is an issue but they do not know the scale of the problem, because they are not monitoring or reporting surgical fires, but there is also a need for education and training. There is currently no national guidance or safety recommendations to prevent surgical fires in operating theatres. And surgical fires must become a “never event”. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maria Caulfield MP, responded on behalf of the NHS in England, and stated that she was concerned that there is no central record of how many surgical fires are taking place, agreed that staff training is a priority, and offered to meet Mr Shannon to look at guidelines to make sure they come forward, because surgical fires can not become “never events” without national guidance or safety recommendations. The Minister ended by stating that she hopes to share some progress with members in the new year.</p>

<p>My week ended when I attended the Advent 4 service at St David’s Church in Neath, and as usual I was given the warmest welcome. Reverend Stuart Ghezzi gave a wonderful sermon about the importance that greetings play in our life, and how we have adapted our greetings in Covid times. It was so good to see Neath Benefice Secretary Helen, Rector’s Warden Paul, and many members of the congregation who have become dear friends over the many years that I have been a member of Neath Benefice. Many thanks go to Canon Rector Linda Newman for doing a wonderful job at leading the Neath Benefice during such challenging times.</p>

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients. You can find further information about the vaccination programme on the NHS website. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccination-programme/?fbclid=IwAR1fpUmKNp4yRr6QmFb7LJiCh5LvoLTJx6-Qah39dx87VAq6ASeUi1ZiApM" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/&#8230;/covid-19-vaccination&#8230;/</a>This is more progress on the path to recovery and a bit of good news as we keep up the fight against C-19. </p>

              <h3>Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>Schools in Lincolnshire will receive £50million in extra funding next year, as part of a £4 billion funding boost from the Conservative Government across the country.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funding per pupil will increase nationally by five per cent in real terms from next year, giving significant increases for every pupil in every school.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A record £1 billion extra will be spent to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, so that all young people can reach their full potential.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that schools in Lincolnshire will receive £648 million in funding next year, a boost of £50million as part of the Conservative Government’s £4 billion increase in spending for schools across the country.</p>
<p>The £4 billion extra funding for school delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment when entering Downing Street, when he pledged to level up school funding by pledging over £14 billion for primary and secondary schools by 2022-23.</p>
<p>The £50million extra funding can use for hiring specialist teachers, providing training, and purchasing school supplies including textbooks.</p>
<p>The total extra funding for schools means mainstream schools will receive £41.7 billion in 2022-23, an increase of 5.8 per cent per pupil. Every primary school will receive at least £4,362 per pupil, and every secondary school at least £5,669 per pupil.</p>
<p>Matt Warman has also commended the Conservative Government’s targeted £1 billion boost to funding for special educational needs and disabilities, which is a record 13 per cent increase on this year’s funding.</p>
<p>The extra funding will help schools, councils, and other specialist providers provide the right care and support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities – so that every child receives the help they need to learn and fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>The increases in school funding follows the investment of nearly £5 billion in education recovery, which includes £1.5 billion on tutoring in schools and colleges across the country to help children and young people catch up on lost learning during the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<p>“No child or young person should be limited by where they grow up – they should be supported to get a world class education at school.</p>
<p>“The £50million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire will help them to hire more teachers, get materials to support pupils learning, and support pupils with special needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>“As we build back fairer, this funding will ensure every young person can receive the education they deserve so they can fulfil their potential.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Schools Minister Robin Walker said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Every pupil, no matter where they grow up or go to school, deserves an excellent education and the chance to fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>“This £4 billion funding boost delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment to level up school funding – giving significant increases to every pupil in every school – and taken alongside our ambitious education recovery plan with additional investment of almost £5 billion, will support every young person to catch up following the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This additional investment also represents a significant boost to high needs funding, helping local authorities support pupils with special educational needs, and helping to ensure all young people can thrive and succeed.”</p></blockquote>

              <h3>Karin Smyth (Bristol South)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Christmas approaching fast we all want to have time with our family and friends. Last year the vast majority of us followed the rules; staying away from loved ones when we most wanted to be with them. We did this to keep Bristol safe from the rapidly rising Covid-19 rates. I know that this sacrifice meant some of you missed final Christmases with relatives and that pain will still be felt today. That heartache must only have been intensified by revelations that the Prime Minister held several parties in Downing Street. Obviously, he believes that the rules didn’t apply to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a dangerous time for our country. To have someone in charge that has taken a wreaking ball to public trust is not someone who is fit to lead. But I implore you to take extra care this winter to ensure we can protect the NHS from being overwhelmed by Omicron.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst we may not have faith in this Prime Minister, we do in the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty. He is someone of integrity, expertise and compassion for keeping our country safe. Professor Whitty has told us to minimise contact with those we don’t necessarily need to see and prioritise those who we desperately want to meet over Christmas. I thoroughly endorse his pleas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep safe, get your booster jab and remember that together we can secure the better future we all yearn for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business of holding the Government to account stretches far beyond Covid-19 and this week I took part in legislation to argue against the proposed scrapping of trailer safety tests for drivers on our roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government are seeking to remove the need for car and trailer tests required for drivers who tow heavy trailers. The Government continue to push the notion that this is needed to increase the number of driving examiners to increase the number of HGV tests available. However, all evidence shows that we have excess capacity in our testing regime. Moreover, I have the backing of the Road Haulers Association and the Association of British Insurers that these measures are dangerous and not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government are now unleashing thousands of untrained, unsafe and unqualified drivers of trailers on to our roads. It really does beggar belief that we are still doing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my new role acting as the Shadow Minister for Social Care, providing maternity leave cover, I took part in a virtual roundtable. We were joined by a large number of influential expert stakeholders in the sector who shared their views on how we can develop a social care system that works for all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we support and fund social care, we can help families stay together, children enjoy a childhood, the elderly grow old with dignity and love. This is the society that Labour want to build and working with stakeholders within society is how we achieve that.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met with other members of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee this week to hear from the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman about the impact of the pandemic on their ability to carry out their work. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman is an incredibly important body which exists to hold the public sector to account and works to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money for the work within the public sector. It is therefore incredibly important that their work has continued throughout the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to join BBC News on Wednesday evening to discuss the new Covid protection measures. It was extraordinary to see a hundred Tory MPs marching through the no voting lobby in Parliament this week against these precautions. The Prime Minister is now rudderless and unable to lead his party or government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, Labour stood up when the Conservative Party stood aside. Without Labour votes, including mine, these Covid protection measures wouldn’t have passed and we would have been in a perilous situation as a country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that this Christmas seems to be a case of history repeating itself with Covid infections on the rise. This will no doubt be another tough yuletide. But I want everyone in Bristol South to remember that together better times will be with us. If we follow the rules, showing an example to those who do not, we can protect our loved ones from this horrendous pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you a safe Christmas. Let’s all look out for each other so we can have a better 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As ever, if there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/12/17/weekly-round-up-12/">Weekly Round-Up</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I have received a large volume of emails in connection with the further restrictions covering a range of views and suggestions and the Government had repeatedly amended the format of the vote which took place on Tuesday evening. I have noted the contents of every email when forming my view and hope to set out below how I voted on each aspect.</p>
<p><strong>A. Face Coverings in a list of indoor venues </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the re-imposition of masks and face coverings in most settings for those who are able to wear them. There is evidence to suggest that masks are effective in reducing the spread of airborne based viruses and the wearing of masks is uncomfortable at worst for the vast majority of people. If masks provide any protection at all, they are worth persevering with and I was concerned and disappointed to see the Government abandon this mandate earlier in the year, especially when it comes to public transport. I therefore voted in favour of this measure.</p>
<p><strong>B. Self Isolation Changes (Using lateral flow tests instead of isolation for vaccinated contacts of Covid-19 cases) </strong></p>
<p>Quite recently to Government announced that they would be returning to fixed isolation for all contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19 where it is suspected that the positive case was the new omicron variant. The Government then proposed to move away from this to allow those who are vaccinated to continue to take daily lateral flow tests in lieu of isolation.</p>
<p>In my view, as I will set out in greater detail below, the early data suggests that while maximum vaccination provides ample protection against symptoms and illness associated with the omicron variant of Covid-19, there is little data to suggest that the vaccination reduces transmission of the variant. As such, I feel that a negative lateral flow test provides at least a degree of certainty that the virus is not present, and as such this should be sufficient to allow people to continue normal life. I would add that should any person have any symptoms whatsoever, they must seek a PCR test as soon as possible and isolate until they receive their results.</p>
<p><strong> C. Covid Status Certification </strong></p>
<p>I’m fundamentally opposed to any certification programme which does not allow for those who have not been, or can not be vaccinated from obtaining the certification required to access venues and events accordingly. Additionally, I’m opposed to the introduction of any certificate based entry system without the subsequent evidence to show that it would be effective, how it would be effective and why it is necessary.</p>
<p>At present, the data appears to show that while the omicron variant is highly transmissible, vaccination status does not appear to provide any or much protection against transmission and the Government have continued to ignore calls to produce the evidence required to show that this type of scheme would be effective. As a starting point, the Government have failed to convince me, through data, that a scheme to restrict entry based largely on vaccination status is an effective public health measure. I was pleased to see the option to complete a lateral flow test instead, and would have ordinarily been more inclined to support such a scheme on this basis, but for the two issues set out below.</p>
<p>First, it can not be right to bring in a form of certification like this which allows for individuals to satisfy the criteria through the completion of a LFT, on the same week where it would appear almost impossible to obtain LFT devices. Such a scheme in these circumstances, therefore, becomes an actual vaccine passport, which I fundamentally oppose.</p>
<p>Second, even if the distribution of LFT devices was to be resolved, I can not in good conscience vote in favour of a scheme which places huge constraints on the hospitality sector in particular, and larger venues who have been the hardest hit since March 2020; without any discernible support through either financial backing or infrastructure, during the busiest period of the year for many of these businesses.</p>
<p>Without the data to back up such a scheme and show its effectiveness, without proper support for the businesses and employees who are being forced to administer this scheme and without ready access to LFT devices, I felt that I could not support this introduction.</p>
<p>However, should the above be satisfied, I would be happy to support such a scheme in the future and for this reason, I abstained.</p>
<p><strong>D. Extension of Mandatory Vaccination for NHS and Care Workers</strong></p>
<p>I’m generally opposed to mandatory vaccination schemes across society, especially where measures can be introduced to placate the need for vaccinations.</p>
<p>In this instance, as referred to above, it is not clear that vaccinations help prevent transmission of the latest variant to any notable degree, and as such, I’m concerned that vaccination status alone is providing false reassurance of safety. I understand that the alternative plans would be to continue to test through both LFT and PCR all staff who are working in and around the health and care sectors and I completely agree with this. It is imperative that we protect those who are most vulnerable and the best way to do that is to ensure that every precaution is taken to prevent the virus being transmitted from staff to patients. Given the current data, I would think this would be much better achieved through testing than vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we are already facing huge vacancy numbers across the health and care sector at a time where both services are under excessive strain. It would be the worst possible time to lose further staff through a scheme of this nature. I could not, therefore, support this action.</p>
<p>I hope the above sets out my view on the most recent vote in Parliament.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>I know that there are strong views on both sides of the argument about the new restrictions, but for the purposes of this message I thought it just helpful to explain what is now required.</p>
<p>There are three major changes in effect from now for the next few weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face coverings are required by law in most indoor settings outside the home. This does not apply to hospitality settings where you are eating or drinking.</li>
<li>People who can work from home are now being asked to do so.</li>
<li>From today, certain venues and events will be required by law to check that all visitors aged 18 years or over are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative test in the last 48 hours, or have an exemption. This includes nightclubs and big sporting and entertainment events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Isolation</h2>
<p>The self-isolation requirements have also changed. If you test positive for Covid you are still required to isolate for a period of ten days, even if you do not have symptoms. But if you live with or come into contact with someone who tests positive, you do not have to isolate but are instead asked to take a daily lateral flow test to continue to check that you are not positive yourself.</p>
<h2>Travel to Africa</h2>
<p>For those seeking to travel to parts of Africa, the system of hotel quarantine has now been scrapped. Everyone travelling abroad is still required to take a lateral flow or PCR test before their return to the UK, and is required to take a PCR test on their return and to isolate until they get the (hopefully negative) result. You then only need to carry on isolating if the test is positive.</p>
<p>All the latest details and guidance can be found <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#what-has-changed">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Lateral Flow Tests</h2>
<p>I know that there have been some issues locally with the supply of home tests. I have spoken to local pharmacists and ministers about this, and there is no overall shortage of the tests, though the sudden increase in demand means that there has been a problem getting the tests distributed quickly enough. Hopefully that is on the way to being resolved.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 Booster Programme</h2>
<p>Most people over the age of 50 have now had their booster jabs in our area, but the expansion of the booster programme to all other adults means a significant increase in the demand locally and it will take a bit of time for the local health service to get all of this sorted. I would like to extend my thanks to all of those involved in the programme and particularly to people who have come forward this week to volunteer to help accelerate the programme.</p>
<p>I will continue to provide updates as and when I have more information that I hope will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Tuesday 14 December, Preet Kaur Gill MP has opened a debate in the House of Commons to challenge the Government on funding for neighbourhood policing and its fair funding across the West Midlands.</p>
<p>In her speech she called on the Government to give local Police forces a fighting chance of tackling crime following 11 years of Conservative Government cuts to the West Midlands which has seen more than 2,220 officers lose their jobs, a further £175 million of funding removed from West Midlands Police’s budget and more than 20 Police stations earmarked for closure.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “We’ve seen how crime across Birmingham and the West Midlands has increased dramatically over the last decade, and I worry about the future of policing should this continue. With these dramatic cuts to our neighbourhood policing, it comes as no surprise that the West Midlands has the fourth highest rate of crime in the country, and it is residents that are feeling the impact and are being let down when they most need help.</p>
<p>“Neighbourhood policing is all about preventing crime and building relationships in the communities where officers serve. However, the direct result of these funding cuts means that West Midlands Police are operating on a reactive basis.  Across Birmingham, we’re seeing neighbourhood Police officers coming off shift at 11pm which means the safety of the whole city is left to central response. If you’re one of my constituents in Bartley Green or Quinton and are in a life-threatening situation, because you are so far out from the city centre, that’s at best a 15-minute wait. It simply isn’t good enough.”</p>
<p>This approach also has an impact on prosecution rates. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of crimes that end in a charge or court summons has halved, with justice for victims of violent offences at an even worse rate.</p>
<p>Gill continued, “Ultimately, all of this means that West Midlands Police can’t meet the demands for its services in protecting vulnerable people with the resources it has. That isn’t right and is why I’m proud to work alongside our PCC Simon Foster and my parliamentary colleagues to prioritise police officers, because it is police officers that keep you and your family safe. I hope this debate brings this disastrous approach to light and to fight for a policing service that is fit for the future.”</p>
<p>The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster said, "Reckless government cuts have dismantled neighbourhood policing, with numbers dropping in the West Midlands from 1,821 in 2010 to 760 in 2018. That was a big mistake. It was counter-productive and a false economy. We have all been being paying the price with less justice, safety and security. This is why I have launched a cross-party campaign for a fair funding deal for West Midlands Police to help us get officer numbers back to 2010 levels.</p>
<p>"My core mission during my term of office will be to rebuild community policing. Community policing is the bedrock of British policing. It embodies the principle of policing by consent on which policing in our country is built. It provides the preventative, proactive, problem solving and visible policing that the people and communities of the West Midlands want.</p>
<p>"I will begin the crucial work of rebuilding it to keep people, their families and communities safe. As a start, on my mission to rebuild community policing, I will aim to put 450 additional officers into neighbourhood policing, strengthening the local bonds between the public and the police and improving our ability to proactively solve local issues before they become critical. Much more government support is needed to get back to the community policing levels we had a decade ago."</p>

<p>Judith was delighted to hear that local Bradford South charity Sandale Trust has received funding from Morrison&#8217;s Foundation to support their community.</p>



<p>The funding will help the Sandale Community Development Trust, based in Buttershaw,&nbsp;to offer twice-weekly drop-in sessions at their community hub for residents who have been experiencing isolation, helping them to meet other people and offering the opportunity to gain new life skills and take part in volunteering roles.</p>



<p>Training courses will also be available on first aid and mental health awareness, providing users with skills that build confidence and will have a lasting impact long after the project.</p>



<p><strong>Judith said:</strong></p>



<p>“The team at Sandale Trust work at the heart of the community in Buttershaw and Woodside and offer a wide range of community activities that put people first.</p>



<p>&#8220;Through the pandemic, their efforts to provide free school meals, food parcels, and work with isolated members in our community has been a lifeline for many and has doubtless saved lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Supported by this Morrisons Foundation grant, they are now leading the way locally in helping hard-hit families as we recover.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was delighted to endorse their application, which will see Sandale provide space, support and training to bring residents together and build resilience in the community.”</p>

<p>MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar Angus MacNeil is to meet with the Hebridean Housing Partnership (HHP) in the coming weeks regarding concerns over housing on the islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: &nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;At the recent Western Isles Fishermen’s AGM concerns were raised about the lack of housing in Leverburgh. Following that meeting I wrote to HHP raising the need for greater accessibility to housing in Leverburgh and in other areas and was delighted to learn from HHP that they are indeed conducting a feasibility study in Leverburgh.</p>



<p>“HHP tell me that they are currently researching and will reporting on the housing needs in Leverburgh with a view to building. I hope that they do go ahead and build in Leverburgh but I understand that they have to go through their procedures.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is right that HHP do their processes of diligence, but it is also right that voices in the community that probably instinctively know what is required, are given due weight as well. I am amplifying these voices and calling for houses to be built in Leverburgh to meet the needs of the community, businesses and all.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At full council yesterday
afternoon, Cllr Longford was asked what she would like to see from COP26 this
week and what progress Nottingham has made on its carbon neutral ambition. The
question came from Mike Edwards, Councillor for the Meadows. </p>



<p>In response Cllr Sally
Longford said “I think we would all agree that the desired outcome for COP
would be that agreement is reached to work together internationally to, secure
global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach. But we also
need to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats, and to mobilise
finance, particularly for communities at the greatest threat from the effects
of climate change.”<br>
<br>
Cllr Sally Longford will be attending COP26 this week as part of the Core
Cities delegation, to showcase Nottingham’s response to the climate emergency
and learn from cities around the world about what more we can do. </p>



<p>Cllr
Longford also updated Full Council on significant progress in Nottingham toward
its 2028 carbon neutral goal:</p>



<ul><li>City CO2
emissions have reduced by 53% per capita since 2005, the most of any UK core
city and</li><li>45% of the
Council fleet is now ULEV. </li><li>First in world to
use purpose built electric bin wagons and over </li><li>14,500 trees have
been planted since 2019 with 50,000 by 2023. </li><li>130 public EV
charging points, with an additional </li><li>81 recently
installed at new Broadmarsh Car Park.</li><li>Since 2012, over
7,000 social and private hard-to-heat homes have been insulated and over 4,000
social housing properties now have solar panels.</li></ul>



<p>“However I am far from
complacent, there is much to do and we cannot do this on our own.” insisted
Cllr Sally Longford.<br>
<br>
“We need Government, private investment and other stakeholders to support our
vital work. We have already had demonstrator projects in the city, but they
need to be scaled up, creating jobs and achieving a just transition to a low
carbon economy, where our more deprived communities can benefit from warmer
homes, affordable energy and access to clean modes of transport.”</p>



<p>Last Saturday worldwide
marches took place to demand international action on climate change. Cllr
Longford attended, and spoke at, the event.</p>



<p>“I was honoured to be given
the opportunity to lead the march alongside Lilian Greenwood, with a diverse
group of people, on Saturday to stand up for Climate Justice and to speak at
the rally in the Old Market Square.”</p>



<p>Councillor Longford wrapped
up her answer by stating “We need the Government to take action, and truly
commit to a net zero-carbon future.” </p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

              <h3>Emma Lewell-Buck (South Shields)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>



<p>You can read my full speech <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-10-27/debates/2FE67ECE-5C5C-4910-876B-9610627E645A/SewagePollutionWhitburn">here.</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
