<p>I think the PM was right to say he needs to stay in the UK to work with the Chancellor on a good budget rather than flying to Egypt. It would be better if these conferences to urge us all to travel less  and to burn less fuel were more often conducted on line to set an example on the issue of jet travel and to make their own contribution to reducing CO2 .</p>
<p>COP 27 faces the same big problem COP 26 faced. China generating 30% of the world&#8217;s CO 2 intends to  carry on increasing its output for most of this decade. President Xi will not be in Egypt for others to lobby him  to do what western countries are doing to cut their output. Current policy of us closing down energy intensive activities and fossil fuel mines and wells in order to import goods  from China does nothing to cut world CO 2. In many cases it  boosts it as we spend more on transport and on less environmentally friendly production in China. India, Russia and Brazil also are large producers of CO 2.</p>
<p>COP 27 does face a new problem from COP 26. As a result of the war in Ukraine and the need for the EU to cut its use of Russian gas, countries like Germany and Poland will be using more coal. China, facing shortages of power from hydro and renewables has also turned to more coal dependence. This is against the main conclusion of COP 26 that  countries should make rapid progress to eliminate coal, treating gas as a transition fuel whilst renewable electricity was expanded and technologies developed to store it for times when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what solutions they propose to tackle this difficulty.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>For too long our area has been treated by successive Governments as a ‘rural backwater’, and that’s why, since becoming the MP back in 2010, I have spent so much of my time working with local businesses, entrepreneurs and councillors to advocate for a ‘Rural Renaissance’ here in Mid Norfolk and the East. </p>

<p>I have consistently voiced my belief that we stand on the cusp of something special in our area, a once-in-a-generation chance to drive a new cycle of growth, investment and jobs. </p>

<p>The Eastern region is fast becoming the home of the most innovative companies in Europe, especially within the fields of food, medicine and energy (known broadly as ‘life sciences’), as well as in innovation and engineering. We already have the globally respected Norwich Research Park on a doorstep, which employs 11,000 people and is home to a variety of world-leading enterprises like the John Innes Centre and Sainsbury Laboratory. There’s the incredible Hethel Engineering Centre, at which Lotus has seen over a £1bn worth of investment in recent years, and the Easton Food Hub, home to the world’s largest vertical far, too.  </p>

<p>As a Member of Parliament and having served as the first ever Minister of Life Sciences, I have been honoured to play my role in helping to drive forward this agenda and promoting the work of Norfolk entrepreneurs and businesses in Government and around the world – including through my <a href="http://thenorfolkway.co.uk/">Norfolk Way</a> project, a not for profit social enterprise to promote a more entrepreneurial rural economy. </p>

<p>I am determined to do all I can to champion Norfolk in this regard – especially as our county looks to lead the way for our country’s Green Revolution and play a key role as the UK seeks to establish itself as a true ‘Science Superpower’ (an agenda I have been heavily involved in when serving as Minister for Science, Research and Innovation earlier this year). </p>

<p>If we can capitalise on our area’s role in these huge growth sectors, I believe we will see more investment coming to our area and more businesses ‘spinning out’ and setting up in our local towns and villages. In turn, they will train more local people and provide thousands more well paid jobs, breathing fresh life into our local communities and raising more money to invest in our local services and infrastructure. </p>

<p>That’s why I was delighted to see today’s article in the EDP highlighting why the A11 Tech Corridor must become an Investment Zone (see <a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/business/why-a11-tech-corridor-must-be-investment-zone-9343220">here</a>). This is a BIG opportunity to turbo-charge the process I have outlined above and I am relishing the chance to work with local councillors to state Norfolk’s case. </p>

<p>I would like to see our local stations at Wymondham and Attleborough at the centre of regeneration plans that make them accessible gateways to the nearby town centres and local housing, encouraging people to use the railway line (and taking cars off our roads) while also attracting businesses and tourists to come and use 5G meeting spaces and incubators in the surrounding area. I would also like to see more investment being made into local businesses, creating thousands more opportunities for local people and spreading wealth and positive growth and development.  </p>

<p>Rest assured however, I will not accept a scenario in which this wonderful opportunity become an excuse to drive a “coach and horses” through our local environmental protections and facilitate blanket development on our green spaces. As I have vocally said over the years, we should be embracing a better model of development (see more on my planning campaign page <a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/planning-and-protecting-our-rural-landscape-and-heritage">here</a>) – one that respects and enhances local communities and protects our precious rural way of life (the very thing that makes our area such a nice place to live and work in, as well as visit). </p>

<p>I have sought assurances from ministers and officials and have been clearly informed that, while the Government intends to remove burdensome EU requirements as part of the Investment Zone proposals, key planning policies that protect our natural habitats and maintain national environmental policies on the Green Belt and other green areas will be unaffected. The Government focus is only on removing unnecessary bureaucracy which does nothing to protect the environment but holds up permitted development. (I will be following developments on this closely to ensure this remains the case). </p>

<p>I am committed to doing all I can to lead this ‘Rural Renaissance’ and improve the lives and prospects of my Mid Norfolk constituents. To find out more, please visit my campaign titled ‘Norfolk’s Innovation Economy’ <a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/norfolks-innovation-economy">here</a> and see more on my other local work on my website <a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/">here</a>. </p></div>

<p>Today I called for a legal right for care home residents to have visits from their loved ones.</p>
<p>The terrible consequences of banning families from seeing their loved ones in care homes is an issue very close to my heart. It is something that Labour has been campaigning on since the very first covid lockdown in June 2020. Indeed, we first called on the Government to bring forward a legal right for care home residents to see a family member or friend in February 2021. We continue to do so because, sadly, this issue has not gone away.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government have resisted calls for residents to have a legal right to see their family member. They have consistently said that the guidance they issued on facilitating visits was enough, but the guidance, which changed more than 30 times during the pandemic, is not enough, as we have seen time and again.</p>
<p>That is why I urged the Government to put a legal right in place.</p>

              <h3>Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has called on the Royal Mail to &#8216;stop the threats of job cuts to valued postal workers’ and &#8216;engage meaningfully&#8217; with the Communications Worker Union to find an acceptable solution to prevent further postal strikes.</p>



<p>Local postal workers took strike action earlier this week and several more strike days are planned next month.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil &#8211; whose late father was a Post Man &#8211; signed a Joint Letter from SNP MPs to the Royal Mail Chief.</p>



<p>The letter stated that it is &#8220;unacceptable to see the language employed by Royal Mail in threatening its workforce with job losses because they dare to ask for a fair work package.&#8221;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Last week, the Royal Mail&#8217;s announced its intention to slash 10,000 jobs, citing the strike action and low parcel delivery sales as the reason. Mr MacNeil has called this move a &#8216;tactic in the ongoing pay dispute with postal workers&#8217; and has accused Royal Mail of &#8216;acting in bad faith&#8217;.</p>



<p>Commenting, Mr MacNeil said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Postal workers are struggling to make ends meet in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while Royal Mail shareholders benefited from bumper profits in the millions.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is understandable that postal workers find the argument that there isn&#8217;t money for them to have a fair wage unpalatable when there are millions of pounds of profit for shareholders, who should share the burden – when hard working postal staff are struggling to put food on their table this winter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Royal Mail staff and their families need financial security. The decision to strike will not have been easy for any of them, but this is about more than pay; it is also about protecting the universal mail service we all expect and value.</p>



<p>&#8220;Royal Mail need to get back to the negotiating table – in a meaningful way – and put our communities at the heart of discussions.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn’t think I’d be returning to this so soon, but Tory leaders change quicker than football managers these days. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Just six weeks after telling us Liz Truss was the answer, we’re inundated with Tory MPs claiming Rishi Sunak, whom they rejected in favour of Liz Truss, is now the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wish the new PM well but can’t ignore the fact this is a coronation and not an election and he did serve as Boris Johnson’s Chancellor while presiding over 10% inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government of our country isn’t some board game where you make and change alliances on the throw of the dice. It’s about honest, difficult decisions which have far reaching consequences. Our system relies on a democratic election where people vote for the party which makes the best offer, and its leader forms a government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re now on three PMs and four chancellors in the last four months. There’s yet another cabinet reshuffle pending. It’s almost impossible to know who’s responsible for anything. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Promises to level up communities and put right problems in social care, the NHS and justice have all been abandoned. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After 12 years, the Tories have nothing to offer but another bout of crippling austerity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s obvious they’ve run out of ideas. &nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re so busy fighting among themselves and acting out of self-interest that they no longer care about the country. That’s why we need a general election. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rishi Sunak can only be regarded as a caretaker. He should be given the necessary support to enact a minimum programme designed to protect the economy from the difficulties which the Tories have caused but only until preparations can be made for an election where the public decides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe it’s time for a change and time for a Labour government which will be honest and realistic about the challenges ahead. We need to protect energy supplies, create new jobs for the future with our green prosperity plan and manage the economy in the interests of everyone, not a privileged few. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m ready to pit that offer against the tired, played out Tories no matter who leads them.&nbsp;</p>

Definitive stamps are the regular “everyday” stamps featuring the profile of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>From 1 February 2023 barcoded Definitive stamps, as shown below, will be the only type of Definitive Stamps valid for postage. This follows an announcement made at the start of 2022, and is not connected with the passing of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>South Shropshire MP, Philip Dunne has urged constituents to use up their old stamps before the 1st February. He said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Many households will have the old type of stamp stashed away in a drawer or desk and run the risk of forgetting to use them before the February deadline.</p>

<p>“With Christmas fast approaching, there is an excellent opportunity to make use of any stamps you may have for sending Christmas cards and connecting with loved ones by post. If you are unable to use up your stock of stamps, they can be exchanged by sending them to Royal Mail along with an exchange form. There is currently no end date for when customers can swap their stamps – so unused stamps can be exchanged after 31 January.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old stamps can be sent to Royal Mail using their FREEPOST address. There is no charge to exchange unused stamps.</p>

<p>Swap forms are available from:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.royalmail.com/barcodedstamps">www.royalmail.com/barcodedstamps</a> where a form can be printed or requested</p>

<p>Royal Mail’s Customer Experience team – customers can call 03457 740740 and request a form be posted to them</p>

<p>From more than 1,200 Customer Service Points at delivery offices</p>

<p>Special Stamps – those that are issued to commemorate special occasions or to celebrate British achievement – will not be barcoded and remain valid for use. Non-barcoded Christmas stamps also remain valid for use throughout the year. These stamps cannot be exchanged.</p></div>

<p>Karin Smyth – MP for Bristol – has called on the new Prime Minister to outline why Suella Braverman MP was reappointed as Home Secretary just six days after being fired for breaching security protocols.</p>
<p>The resignation of Liz Truss MP after 44 days as Prime Minister created the need for the Conservative Party to once again turn inwards and select a new leader, and by extension Prime Minister. 357 Conservative MPs were the electorate for this process. It was planned to then go the Tory membership, but ultimately all candidates dropped out of the contest except Rishi Sunak MP.</p>
<p>Rishi Sunak, Member of Parliament for Richmond, Yorkshire, was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson MP until he resigned in July of this year. He is the first British-Asian to become Prime Minister and has only been an MP since 2015.</p>
<p>The new Prime Minister went about appointing a Cabinet following the request by His Majesty the King to form a government. This saw Dominic Raab MP return as Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister; Simon Hart MP return to Cabinet as Chief Whip; Suella Braverman MP returning as Home Secretary just six days after resigning for breaching security protocols and Michael Gove MP returning as Levelling Up Secretary just 44 days after leaving the post.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“The new Prime Minister has reverted to Tory type. The appointment of Suella Braverman to Home Secretary just six days after her resignation due to serious security breaches means serious questions must be answered regarding her appointment.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister promised integrity on the steps of Downing Street, but instead has seemingly undertaken grubby deals to secure his premiership. We cannot forget that Rishi Sunak was also fined for attending parties in Number 10 alongside Boris Johnson. Standards are an afterthought to the current Tory Government.</p>
<p>“Other appointments to Cabinet show a party that has run out of ideas. Dominic Raab returns as Justice Secretary. This beggars belief as under his watch some courts had average waiting times of 426 days for a trial. That’s on top of the shocking statistic that only 1.3% of rape cases are now being prosecuted. We don’t need another Tory Prime Minister selected behind closed doors; we need a General Election. We need a Labour Government.” </p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/10/27/karin-smyth-mp-says-serious-questions-must-be-answered-regarding-the-home-secretarys-appointment/">Karin Smyth MP says “serious questions must be answered regarding the Home Secretary’s appointment”</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

              <h3>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has tabled an amendment to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill which would give local councils and national park authorities the power to enforce zero carbon standards on new homes in their area.</p>
<p>Tim's proposal would bring forward the date that all new homes would have to meet the Government's standards for CO2 emissions (the Future Home Standard). His amendment would mean that all new homes would have to produce 75-80% lower CO2 emissions than homes that are currently being built - and those which have already been built - by 2023 rather than 2025.</p>
<p>However, Tim's amendment was defeated by 8 votes to 6, with every Conservative MP voting against.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Levelling Up Bill Committee, Tim said: <em>"Most local authorities, certainly ours in Cumbria, are determined to ensure that new builds are built with zero-carbon specification, yet they are not allowed to. If they seek to enforce zero-carbon homes when it comes to insultation, heat pumps, solar panels or a variety of other mechanisms that will ensure there is literally a zero carbon footprint from that property, the developers can object if they think they will incur an unreasonable expense, and the council or planning authority are powerless to do anything about it. It is incredibly frustrating.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"This new clause is significant, as it will genuinely empower local authorities to do the right thing, which they desperately want to. It breaks the heart of councils of all political parties when they see what they need to do and are not allowed to enforce it. More importantly, it will do something to reduce energy costs and make a meaningful contribution to the battle against climate change. This is a really important clause, so I will seek to push it to a vote, because I think the Government have had plenty of time to take action of their own initiative over the last few years.</em>
</p>
<p>Responding, the Minister for Housing Lee Rowley said: <em>"Although I completely understand the honourable gentleman's sentiments and applaud him for pushing us to move as fast as possible, it is reasonable and proportionate that the building sector and construction sector have the opportunity both to comment on how we do that, which is what a consultation will seek to do in due course, and to amend their working practices in order to get to a place where they are able to adhere to the standards in a way that ensures that we address the honourable gentleman's points and can continue to build the houses that we all want to see, so that our constituents can have good roofs over their heads</em>."</p>

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Judith Cummins MP has called on the government to use the power of sport as a ‘force for good’ to bring investment into Bradford.</p>



<p>Speaking in a debate on the contribution of the Rugby League world cup to culture and sport in the UK, Judith highlighted how sport is at the heart of local communities in her Bradford South constituency:</p>



<p>“Week in, week out, local communities come together to support their clubs, their local kids’ teams and young players.”</p>



<p>“However, levels of investment and opportunities haven’t always matched the pride we feel in our towns and cities, but it’s moments like the world cup that will give communities the opportunities to stand tall and showcase where they live to the world.”</p>



<p>“A compelling levelling-up bid has been submitted to government for a world-class stadium and training complex for elite sports with a Rugby League Skills, Training and Education centre in Odsal to serve the people of Yorkshire and the North. I can’t wait to host the world cup again in a decade’s time and be standing in our very own Odsal stadium in Bradford cheering England on!”</p>



<p>Responding to Judith’s invitation to visit Odsal, Sports Minister Stuart Andrew MP said: “If I’m still in post by the end of the week I’ll still come but, if not, I’ll leave a note to my successor that their first trip needs to be to Bradford!”</p>



<p>The 2022 Cup’s world-leading social impact programme has invested more than £26 million in equipment and facilities, volunteering, mental health, culture and education, to transform clubs into hubs for their communities. And, for the first time, the men’s, women’s and wheelchair tournaments will be held concurrently.</p>



<p>A study from the Sheffield Hallam University shows that investment in sport and physical activity gives back four times the investment in social value, equivalent to around £72 billion each year across the UK, improving people’s health and wellbeing, creating jobs and stimulating local economic growth.</p>



<p>Judith is fighting for Bradford to have its share:</p>



<p>“When the competition is over and the winning teams raise their trophies, it is only the start of the story for communities, not the end. With the Rugby League world cup in full swing, Bradford’s year as capital of culture in 2025, and Bradford’s bid for a world-class stadium and sports complex that will bring over a billion pounds of benefits to Bradford, now is the time to ensure that people of Bradford benefit from this legacy.”</p>

              <h3>Martin Docherty (West Dunbartonshire)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>West Dunbartonshire’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes&nbsp;has called on the Royal Mail to stop the threats of job cuts to valued postal workers and &#8216;engage meaningfully&#8217; with the Communications Worker Union to find an acceptable solution to prevent further postal strikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a joint letter to the Chief Executive Officer of Royal Mail, local MP Docherty-Hughes told the Royal Mail Chief that it’s &#8220;unacceptable to see the language employed by Royal Mail in threatening its workforce with job losses because they dare to ask for a fair work package.&#8221;</p>



<p>Postal workers in West Dunbartonshire and across the UK&nbsp;have been on strike again this week, with several more strike days planned early next month, from the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;of November to the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of November.</p>



<p>Last week, the Royal Mail announced its intention to slash 10,000 jobs, citing the strike action and low parcel delivery sales as the reason.&nbsp;Local SNP MP Martin has called this move a &#8216;tactic in the ongoing pay dispute with postal workers&#8217; and has accused Royal Mail of &#8216;acting in bad faith&#8217;.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting,&nbsp;Martin Docherty-Hughes MP&nbsp;said:</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Postal workers across West Dunbartonshire are struggling to make ends meet in the face of the cost-of-living crisis while Royal Mail shareholders benefited from bumper profits in the millions.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is understandable that postal workers find the argument that there isn&#8217;t money for them to have a fair wage unpalatable when&nbsp;there are millions of pounds of profit for shareholders, who should share the burden – when hard working postal staff are struggling to put food on their table this winter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Royal Mail staff and their families across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale need financial security. The decision to strike will not have been easy for any of them, but this is about more than pay; it is also about protecting the universal mail service we all expect and value.</p>



<p>&#8220;Royal Mail need to get back to the negotiating table – in a meaningful way – and put our communities at the heart of discussions.&#8221;</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p>This has been another tumultuous period in British politics culminating with the resignation of the Prime Minister. This had looked inevitable once her mini-budget had to be reversed following the loss of market confidence. The Prime Minister’s diagnosis of the need to do more to increase the growth rate was correct, but sadly the policies she prescribed made the situation worse and it’s right that she has resigned.</p>



<p>We knew that Liz Truss was inheriting a difficult position a few weeks ago with the ongoing cost of living crisis, the significant NHS backlogs, the war in Ukraine and the resulting serious issues with energy prices and supply. To those crises we can now add the market turmoil and the increases in interest rates which are so painful for those with mortgages and will worsen the public finances given the amount of debt we owe – and our ongoing need to borrow.</p>



<p>We should have a new Prime Minister in place by the end of next week, in time for the critical statement by the Chancellor on 31 October setting out the details of the public finances and proposed measures to bring borrowing under control. Regrettably it looks very likely that this will include some difficult measures including tax rises and spending cuts. We will need the new Prime Minister and their team to present a coherent plan that we can unite behind to avoid any further market turmoil.</p>



<p>There has been speculation that these measures should include restricting the increases in the state pension and benefits next April to less than the inflation rate of 10.1%. While increases of this level will represent a significant cost, we cannot seek to balance the books on the backs of the least well off and those unable to work to earn extra money. The state pension has never increased by less than inflation and I’m glad the outgoing Prime Minister confirmed the increase would indeed be 10.1%. We should do the same for benefits too. We can’t expect people livings on the least to get through next winter with less money in real terms than this one.</p>



<p>There have been encouraging signs that global gas prices have started to fall. I hope that this continues and signals that efforts to boost supply and reduce demand around the world have stabilised the position. There are however significant risks this winter and next that in the event of a lengthy period of cold weather we might run out of gas. In the short term we all need to be careful with our use – to reduce our bills and protect supply.</p>



<p>In the longer term we need to do more to obtain secure domestic sources of energy including nuclear, wind solar – and fracking for our own gas. None of these are easy – and very often applications are unpopular. The key thing is to ensure we develop these in areas where they have the least impact and that all applications are properly considered through the planning process with local people consulted. We’ve gone further on fracking and proposed requiring actual local consent which is not required for other planning issues. Again, none of this is easy or popular but relying on cheap imports from abroad is no longer a viable strategy.</p>

<p>In the UK, most households with someone aged 66 or above between 19th and 25th September 2022 are entitled to help towards their energy costs under the Government&#8217;s Winter Fuel Payment scheme. This year during November and December, millions of pensioners will also receive a one-off extra £300 payment which will be paid automatically, usually via direct debit.</p>
<p>You qualify for a Winter Fuel Payment if both the following apply:</p>
<p>• You were born on or before 25 September 1956<br />
• You lived in the UK for at least one day during the week of 19 to 25 September 2022 &#8211; this is called the ‘qualifying week’</p>
<p>There are some exemptions, so I encourage all to find out more about the Winter Fuel Payment here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility">https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility</a></p>

<p>Dear Constituent</p>
<p>I am writing with a reminder about a couple of local things.</p>
<p>A few people have asked me why I do not address national issues in these emails except where there is useful information to provide. I know that many people want to discuss those issues with me, and I am always willing to do so if they contact me directly. But these emails are designed to be informative about local matters, and go to everyone who wants them, regardless of political persuasion, and I do not want to change their local focus even at times when there are significant events at a national level.</p>
<h2>Charity Fair</h2>
<p>Firstly, a reminder that the Charity Volunteer Fair, which was postponed because of the sad death of Her Majesty the Queen, is being held between 4pm and 6pm this Friday, 21<sup>st</sup> October at the Dell Centre, St Giles Church, Park Lane, Ashtead, KT21 1EJ.</p>
<p>More than 20 charities will be there, and there will be a wide range of volunteering opportunities. So please do come along. If you can’t make it but are interested in volunteering, please let me know and I will steer you towards the right opportunities.</p>
<h2>Epsom Methodist Church &#8211; Warm Wednesdays</h2>
<p>Epsom Methodist Church is launching a programme of Warm Wednesdays for the winter if people are struggling with their bills and need a place to go and warm up and get some company. The events will be held every Wednesday from November 2<sup>nd</sup> until the end of February. From 9am &#8211; 2pm there will be complimentary hot drinks served in their café, from  12.30 &#8211; 2pm there will be Hot and tasty soup and a roll, from 2pm onwards complimentary hot drinks and homemade cakes, and from 3pm &#8211; 6pm a family after-school club with space for homework, story time, games, films and a free hot meal for all.</p>
<p>The church is in Ashley Road, Epsom, KT18 5AQ. People are welcome just to drop in.</p>
<h2>Epsom &amp; Ewell Energy Relief Programme</h2>
<p>And finally thank you to everyone who has supported the Epsom and Ewell Energy Efficiency Programme. The appeal has already raised more than £12,000. If you do not need the £400 Government contribution towards bills this winter, please do donate it to the programme and help those locally who are already struggling with higher bills make their homes more energy efficient.</p>
<p>Details of how to give are at <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/98eeCRO3xsv5ggnEf9CRxP?domain=justgiving.com">https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></p>

<p><strong>Local MP Grant Shapps visited Carter’s Sunflowers Specialist Nursery for children with autism, social communication needs and associated disabilities on Friday. </strong> </p>



<p>Over the course of the visit Mr Shapps heard about the establishment’s achievements and met with parents whose children attend the nursery.</p>



<p>Through its amazing work, Carter’s Sunflowers has helped many parents return to work rather than being a full-time carer – in turn improving their own mental health and wellbeing. </p>



<p>Carter’s Sunflowers supports 26 families in the Welwyn Hatfield and wider Hertfordshire area.</p>



<p>Based in Ludwick Family Club, Welwyn Garden City, the nursery is hoping to expand to provide services for more children in need.</p>



<p>“The feedback from parents today is clear – Carter&#8217;s Sunflowers is a unique place for children with specialist needs<a>,”</a> said Mr Shapps.</p>



<p>“The attention to detail from those caring for the children was incredible – I could see that they felt comfortable here”.</p>



<p>“I’m proud to be the local MP for the nursery and will be doing all I can to help find them a larger premisis so they can expand and continue their vital work.”</p>



<p>Lucy Oliveira of Carter’s Sunflowers said “we really appreciate Grant coming along today to find out more about our nursery.</p>

<p>Over the last few years I&#8217;ve got to know this brilliant little charity quite well. We&#8217;ve done sponsored walks and visits, and as they&#8217;ve developed their facilities at Redenham, I&#8217;ve dropped by the catch up. And so it was last week when I dropped in to their annual barbecue when they thank supporters and let people have a look around. The brain child of Billy MacLeod MBE, the organisation works with veterans struggling with PTSD and other mental health challenges, giving them confidence and a sense of mission in their lives. It&#8217;s a really good example of a little platoon making a huge difference, rebuilding lives one by one. </p>

              <h2><a href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/09/27/bust-budget/">Bust Budget</a></h2>
              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>On Friday the new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced what he described as a mini-budget to help deal with the cost of living crisis. The only thing mini about it was the amount of support it provides to the average family and individual in Britain. This completely un-costed budget, will give out the largest tax cuts since 1972, most of which are aimed at the wealthiest in society. That budget in 1972 lead to a short-lived boom, and a much longer bust, with the infamous three-day week and the failure of key services.</p>



<p>The tax cuts in this mini budget, are mainly for the super wealthy, for corporations and for the bankers. The top tax rate of 45p (%) has been completely removed, which is great news for those lucky few that earn over £150,000 a year. Corporation tax increases have been discarded, and the cap on bankers’ bonuses brought in after the financial crisis of 2008 have been scrapped.</p>



<p>But the Tories aren’t content with just giving handouts to the rich, they have also increased the number of Universal Credit recipients who have to actively search for work and attend weekly or fortnightly job centre appointments, if they are working up to 15 hours a week. If they don’t then their benefits will be reduced. Unsurprisingly the mini-budget also attacks trade union rights further, making it harder for working people to strike for the pay and conditions they deserve.</p>



<p>While they have suspended National Insurance increases and cut stamp duty, this support is minute compare to the support for those best off in society. Even in terms of energy bill support, prices being frozen where they are now, simply means they are only twice what they were last year, at the same time that the price for everything else from food to transport is increasing, while wages and benefits remain completely stagnant.</p>



<p>This budget does not serve the needs of the people of Nottingham, it does not help those who need help the most. People earning £20,000 will only save £167 a year. What it will do is drive Britain into an inflationary spiral. It will cause the prices of the goods that residents need to survive to increase further, at a time where benefits and wages are not rising. This will wipe out any gains that residents in the city see from this mini-budget.</p>

<p>The Tories say their budget will stimulate growth; it remains to be seen if it will. What is certain though is that growth in the economy is pointless if it does not lead to increased wages for the average person, if people are not supported to re-skill and obtain jobs in growing sectors, and if people do not have access to suitable affordable housing, whether that’s via home ownership or renting.</p>



<p>The mini budget does nothing to help achieve these aims, Nottingham Labour strongly believe that the budget will not help the people of Nottingham, it will only help a tiny minority of people. A Labour government is needed nationally to give the people of this country and of Nottingham the support and help that they need, and that they deserve.</p>

<li><strong>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan, starting a new era focused on economic growth, whilst tackling the immediate energy crisis and removing barriers for businesses to build the infrastructure we need to grow the British economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan puts more money in people’s pockets by cutting National Insurance and Income Tax – including an extra £330 a year from the cut to National Insurance contributions and saving families £1,400 on their energy bills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To deliver on this mission, the Chancellor has also announced 38 Investment Zones and over 100 infrastructure projects across the country to drive the investment and growth in the areas that need it the most.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan – setting out support for families with their energy bills and unleashing a new era of growth through tax cuts and investment incentives.</p>
<p>Matt Warman MP has welcomed the Chancellor’s measures set out for families across Boston and Skegness who will have their energy bills cut by up to £1,400 through the Energy Price Guarantee, whilst businesses eligible for The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will have their energy bills slashed by cutting the price of wholesale gas.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also confirmed people across the East Midlands will benefit from personal tax cuts – cutting National Insurance contributions by 1.25 per cent, putting an extra £330 a year in people’s pockets and helping them with cost-of-living pressures.</p>
<p>This means two million people across the East Midlands region will save £255 a year thanks to the cut to National Insurance contributions, and 2.4 million people across the East Midlands will save £160 a year thanks to the slash to Income tax in 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside these measures the Conservative Government announced further personal cuts – including cutting stamp duty permanently by doubling the nil-rate band to £250,000 (from £125,000), increasing the nil-rate band for first time buyers to £425,000 (from £300,000) and increasing the value of the property which first-time buyers can claim relief to £625,000 from (£500,000).</p>
<p>These measures combined mean a typical family moving into a semi-detached property will save £2,500 on stamp duty and £1,150 on energy bills – and if they have a combined income of £50,000 around an additional £560 on tax. This is around £4,200 in total.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan also unleashes 38 Investment Zones across England, unlocking housing and driving growth through tax incentives and over 100 infrastructure projects that will be accelerated.</p>
<p>These measures will unleash growth through tax cuts and reform, tackle the immediate energy crisis, removing barriers for business, and building the infrastructure needed to grow the British economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman MP said:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong>“In the face of rising energy prices and cost of living pressures it is right that this Conservative Government has come forward with a serious support package and a plan for growth.</em></p>
<p><em>“I welcome support set out for people across Boston and Skegness today, including cuts to National Insurance contributions, Income Tax and Stamp Duty – all helping families to keep more of their hard-earned money.</em></p>
<p><em>“Only the Conservatives can be trusted to make the reforms we need to grow our economy – delivering higher wages, lower taxes and more money for our public services.”</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Commenting, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Growth is not as high as it should be. This has made it harder to pay for public services, requiring taxes to rise and cost of living pressures to increase.</em></p>
<p><em>“We need to change this and be unashamed in our Growth Plan – expanding the supply side of the economy, through tax incentives and reform, whilst we help families now by cutting their energy bills by £1,400 a year and slashing personal taxes.</em></p>
<p><em>“That is how we will deliver higher wages, greater opportunities, and crucially, fund public services, now and into the future.”</em></p>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>

<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
