<p>On the floor of the House of Commons this morning, South Lakes MP Tim Farron asked the Climate Minister to look at the long-running campaign for a tidal barrage across the Morecambe Bay to generate renewable energy.</p>
<p>Speaking during Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Questions in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"The United Kingdom has the highest tidal range on the planet after Canada, yet we use so very little of it, especially when we consider that a massive majority of the supply chain for marine, tidal and hydro is British. There are so many jobs to be made out of all this.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Will the Minister look particularly at the potential for tidal energy in Morecambe Bay? I know that his honourable Friends on both sides of the bay agree with me on this, so will he meet with me and others who are in favour of getting green energy out of Morecambe Bay to see whether we can take this forward?</em>
</p>
<p>In response, the Minister for Climate, Graham Stuart MP said: <em>"We are seeing these technologies mature, and the honourable gentleman is right: tidal and floating offshore wind projects have won CfDs for the first time ever, which will help these industries grow and strengthen Britain's homegrown renewables sector.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"As he says, we have tremendous tidal potential in this country. He mentioned a site further north, but the Severn estuary has the second highest tidal range in the world, so if we can get it right, there is huge untapped potential."</em>
</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim said: <em>"To be honest, I'm pretty disappointed with the minister's weak and non-committal reply.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"We desperately need to be acting now to get schemes like the Morecambe Bay tidal barrage up and running as soon as possible if we are to create green jobs, put a lid on rising energy bills and tackle climate change."</em>

<p>As the birthplace of British railways, Newcastle has bid to be the home of GBR, so will the Minister tell us what we would win if we were to win? The last Prime Minister, or perhaps she is still the Prime Minister—I am not sure, because I cannot keep up with Tory chaos; anyway, it was a recent Prime Minister—committed to the implementation in full of Northern Powerhouse Rail, so will the Minister also tell us whether that commitment will outlast the transport Bill?</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>They say a week is a long time in politics, but the last five days has been remarkable. Last week, Liz Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister as it became evident that she could no longer command the support of Conservative MPs following a volatile period since she became Prime Minister.</p>

<p>While her policy direction had broad appeal to Conservative Party members, the speed with which she wished to act led to adverse reactions in the financial markets, which with hindsight demonstrated that the mini-budget went too far, too fast.</p>

<p>The need to restore market confidence became a political necessity during such a challenging time for the country, which is why it was critical that the leadership contest was conducted as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Having declared my support for Rishi Sunak both this summer and last Friday, I was pleased to see him elected swiftly yesterday as Leader of the Conservative Party and our next Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Rishi was the best candidate with the experience, skill and aptitude to lead the Country through the international crises, the cost-of-living crisis, restore market confidence and take the difficult decisions to meet these challenges decisively, while commanding support across the Conservative parliamentary party.</p>

<p>I am confident that Rishi will be backed by MPs to deliver his programme in Parliament and will swiftly now build a team of talented, experienced Ministers to serve in his government. He is best placed to rebuild trust in the Conservative Party and deliver our ambition to make our country a fairer and better place to live. I am pleased that so many of my Parliamentary colleagues publicly declared their support.</p>

<p>We have many challenges to face, both at home and abroad. We have over two years until the next General Election, which is due by January 2025. When I surveyed South Shropshire residents in the summer, it was clear that among swing voters who may not have supported the Conservatives in 2019, Rishi Sunak was a popular candidate. Recent by-elections in North Shropshire and local Shropshire Council wards are a stark reminder that we as a party must regain trust amongst the electorate, not just among core Conservative voters.</p>

<p>As a party and a country, we can’t go backwards, we have to move forward. With a clear majority in Parliament, there is a huge opportunity to deliver on the public’s priorities: from helping fund energy costs and tackling inflation, to making it easier for people to afford their own home and improving both our economic prospects and the environment in which we live.</p>

<p>With a responsible approach to balancing the public finances, a Rishi Sunak led Conservative Party will focus on delivering the 2019 manifesto, while recognising that the tumultuous events which have occurred since, notably the impact of the pandemic and now war in Europe, will impact on the pace of what can be delivered.</p>

<p>With strong leadership under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, I am confident that we shall swiftly return to providing the country with the stability and decisive sound judgement the public deserve.</p></div>

<p>Well, what a week it’s been. On Thursday, the Prime Minister resigned after just 44 days in office and announced that a new Tory leader would be chosen within a week in a shortened leadership contest. Cue a weekend of more Tory psychodrama.</p>
<p>Would Boris run? Did he have the necessary support to among his own MPs? Could a deal be struck between the candidates? Leadership speculation dominated the news. Finally, on Monday, the smoke cleared, and Rishi Sunak was elected by Tory members as the next Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Throughout this sorry process, Tory MPs bickered over which candidate would ‘unite the party’ and please the various factions battling it out within the Conservative Party. Precious little was said about the country itself, and how the Conservatives will help ordinary people terrified about what the future holds.</p>
<p>This is why, despite the Tory pantomime, nothing much has changed. We have another Prime Minister &#8211; installed by their party &#8211; in Number 10. Working people are still struggling to put food on the table, food bank use is still rising, and NHS waiting lists are still at record highs. The economic and social damage done by 12 years of Tory rule is still clear for all to see. You wouldn’t trust an arsonist to put out a fire, and I don’t trust the Tories to get us out of the mess they caused.</p>
<p>It’s clear to me that we need a change. Sunak becomes the third Prime Minister this year alone and will pursue an agenda very different to that of his predecessors. The mandate given to the Tory party in 2019 is non-existent.</p>
<p>I know that people in Tameside are fed up. Fed up with seeing their public services suffer from 12 years of neglect and mismanagement. Fed up with working hard and still not seeing their pay packet reflect the cost of living. I want a government that stands up for people in Tameside and makes a difference to people&#8217;s day to day lives.</p>
<p>The contrast between Labour and the Tories couldn’t be clearer. We’ve promised to invest in well-paid jobs; help parents with free breakfast clubs for children; expand the NHS workforce so people get care when they need it; nationalise the railways; improve the rental sector and get more people on the housing ladder just to name a few. The Tories response to this fully costed and transformative Labour policy platform? More bickering, more drama, more of the same.</p>
<p>The Tories&#8217; time is up. They must call a General Election. Now.</p>

I congratulate Rishi Sunak on his election as leader of the Conservative Party. It is important that as our Prime Minister he receives the united support of Conservatives in parliament, as we work together to restore stability to the economy and continue delivering the manifesto on which we were elected in 2019.

              <h3>John Redwood (Wokingham)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p><strong>Rt Hon Sir John Redwood MP (Wokingham) (Con)</strong>: I am glad the Minister agreed that the £60 billion for the energy scheme will of course adjust according to market prices, and let us hope that the current downward trend in some of the gas prices is continued. We need a mild winter and other bits of good fortune, otherwise we could be back facing even bigger <a class="glossary" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=249">bills</a>. I am sure we are all appreciative of the fact that the new Chancellor wishes to review the scheme after March, because this is a very expensive scheme and there may be better ways of doing it to contain the expenditure.</p>
<p>I hope, for example, that consideration will be given, where price controls are still being offered to consumers, to limiting the amount of subsidised fuel any household can buy to a reasonable amount for a normal household, so that those who are in richer households and making much bigger demands on the fuel system would pay for the additional fuel they need—if they are lucky enough to have a heated swimming pool, or whatever it is—and would pay the full price on the extra fuel that such luxuries require. That is offered as a hopeful idea of how one can start to grapple with the very high costs of this scheme without in any way undermining the crucial guarantee to all those who are struggling with their bills already and want this kind of security.</p>
<p>I also have some concerns about the Bank of England estimate. It is quite true that, from Chancellor Darling onwards, quantitative easing decisions have always been jointly taken by Chancellors of the Exchequer and Governors of the Bank of England. One of the main reasons why they have always been joint decisions is that the Bank of England always understandably insisted on a complete capital guarantee against losses on the bonds, because it was envisaging buying so many bonds that they became very big for the Bank of England balance sheet, and it wanted to be reassured that the Treasury and taxpayers stood behind the system in case of losses.</p>
<p>To the extent that this supplementary estimate is to make good losses on bonds that the Bank of England is selling, I have these questions. First, why does the Bank of England think it must sell bonds at this juncture, when the United Kingdom bond market, the American bond market and lots of other bond markets around the world are particularly depressed by the need for a counter-inflation strategy based on high interest rates? We are crystalising a loss that, as I understand it, the Treasury then has to pay for, whereas if we have an unrealised loss, no payments are of course needed until eventual redemption, and very often the redemption value of the bond is considerably higher than today’s price in the market. I cannot quite understand why the Bank needs to sell these bonds now, and as this has always been a joint policy in which Chancellors have been very heavily involved and have heard Bank of England advice—Chancellors had to sign it off because the taxpayer is at risk, not the Bank of England itself—I hope this will be carefully re-examined.</p>
<p>To those who say that we do need to be selling bonds as well as putting up interest rates to curb inflation, I would say they should be careful not to overdo it. If the Bank really does feel it has to tighten even more, it can do so by a further rise in interest rates; it does not have to do so by selling bonds. Very directly, as we see tonight, the sale of these bonds can realise a loss and then can trigger a cash requirement on taxpayers and the Treasury at an extremely bad time for such a cash requirement. I think all of us have much better priorities than paying for bonds that are underwater, when we see the current state of the economy and the need to route more money to individuals and companies in the right ways, to see off a longer and deeper downturn and provide some balance in the public accounts. I ask the Minister and Chancellor to think again, and to talk again to the Governor of the Bank of England about their joint responsibility. They must ask whether this is really the right time to be crystalising losses, resulting in unspecified amounts of money that will have to be paid.</p>

<p>Responding to the announcement that Rishi Sunak is set to become the UK’s next Prime Minister, West Dunbartonshire’s MP <strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes said:</strong></p>



<p><em>“It’s preposterous that another Tory Prime Minister is going to be imposed on Scotland, without any democratic legitimacy.</em></p>



<p><em>“We haven’t voted Tory in Scotland for almost 70 years, yet this is the fifth different Conservative Prime Minister we’ll face in just 6 years.</em></p>



<p><em>“The previous occupants at No. 10, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, have trashed the economy and pushed struggling families to the brink.</em></p>



<p><em>“The last thing our communities in West Dunbartonshire need is another UK Prime Minister we didn’t vote for imposing damaging austerity cuts.</em></p>



<p><em>“Rishi Sunak is a multi-millionaire who as Chancellor slashed Universal Credit for hard-pressed households. The new Prime Minister boasted to Tory party members that he deliberately diverted cash away from deprived areas like ours.</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s clear ordinary people here face paying a heavy price for living under Westminster rule. Scotland needs independence so we can choose a different path, and rid ourselves of Tory governments we don’t vote for once and for all.”</em></p>

<p>This has been another tumultuous period in British politics culminating with the resignation of the Prime Minister. This had looked inevitable once her mini-budget had to be reversed following the loss of market confidence. The Prime Minister’s diagnosis of the need to do more to increase the growth rate was correct, but sadly the policies she prescribed made the situation worse and it’s right that she has resigned.</p>



<p>We knew that Liz Truss was inheriting a difficult position a few weeks ago with the ongoing cost of living crisis, the significant NHS backlogs, the war in Ukraine and the resulting serious issues with energy prices and supply. To those crises we can now add the market turmoil and the increases in interest rates which are so painful for those with mortgages and will worsen the public finances given the amount of debt we owe – and our ongoing need to borrow.</p>



<p>We should have a new Prime Minister in place by the end of next week, in time for the critical statement by the Chancellor on 31 October setting out the details of the public finances and proposed measures to bring borrowing under control. Regrettably it looks very likely that this will include some difficult measures including tax rises and spending cuts. We will need the new Prime Minister and their team to present a coherent plan that we can unite behind to avoid any further market turmoil.</p>



<p>There has been speculation that these measures should include restricting the increases in the state pension and benefits next April to less than the inflation rate of 10.1%. While increases of this level will represent a significant cost, we cannot seek to balance the books on the backs of the least well off and those unable to work to earn extra money. The state pension has never increased by less than inflation and I’m glad the outgoing Prime Minister confirmed the increase would indeed be 10.1%. We should do the same for benefits too. We can’t expect people livings on the least to get through next winter with less money in real terms than this one.</p>



<p>There have been encouraging signs that global gas prices have started to fall. I hope that this continues and signals that efforts to boost supply and reduce demand around the world have stabilised the position. There are however significant risks this winter and next that in the event of a lengthy period of cold weather we might run out of gas. In the short term we all need to be careful with our use – to reduce our bills and protect supply.</p>



<p>In the longer term we need to do more to obtain secure domestic sources of energy including nuclear, wind solar – and fracking for our own gas. None of these are easy – and very often applications are unpopular. The key thing is to ensure we develop these in areas where they have the least impact and that all applications are properly considered through the planning process with local people consulted. We’ve gone further on fracking and proposed requiring actual local consent which is not required for other planning issues. Again, none of this is easy or popular but relying on cheap imports from abroad is no longer a viable strategy.</p>

<p>In the UK, most households with someone aged 66 or above between 19th and 25th September 2022 are entitled to help towards their energy costs under the Government&#8217;s Winter Fuel Payment scheme. This year during November and December, millions of pensioners will also receive a one-off extra £300 payment which will be paid automatically, usually via direct debit.</p>
<p>You qualify for a Winter Fuel Payment if both the following apply:</p>
<p>• You were born on or before 25 September 1956<br />
• You lived in the UK for at least one day during the week of 19 to 25 September 2022 &#8211; this is called the ‘qualifying week’</p>
<p>There are some exemptions, so I encourage all to find out more about the Winter Fuel Payment here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility">https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility</a></p>

<p>The UK now faces its third Prime Minister this year as Liz Truss has resigned after a mere 44 days in the job. The country is facing an economic crisis that cannot be blamed on either Covid or the war in Ukraine but one which is a result of failed economic policies from the Tory Party. What we need is stability and a plan to support ordinary people who are worried about how they are going to get through this winter, not a Party who are fighting with one another and more concerned with clinging onto power than serving the national interest. Enough is enough. We need a General Election now.</p>
<p>I was pleased to be able to speak in the House of Commons this week on the Economic Update from the new Chancellor. Jeremy Hunt has regularly warned that workforce burnout across the NHS and social care had reached emergency levels and was extremely dangerous to the functioning of the NHS. Now that he is in position to make financial commitments, will he stand by the statements that he has previously made? The NHS and Social Care is in severe trouble but its most important asset is its people. We have to invest in them and ensure that they are supported and protected from burnout. But in order to do that we have to put the resources into training places, into ensuring that pay remains competitive, and that we have enough staff to manage the workload.</p>
<p>I was pleased to support the Menopause Mandate this week by joining their drop in. The Menopause Mandate is devoted to creating a coalition of campaigners working to ensure that women receive the advice and support they need from both our health service and wider society. In 2021 Menopause Support revealed that 41% of UK medical schools don&#8217;t have mandatory menopause education on their curriculum. The Menopause Mandate wants to see health professionals adequately educated so that women are able to receive the advice and support they deserve. Stats from the Nuffield Health Group revealed that just over a quarter of women who visited a GP said the possibility of their symptoms being menopause wasn&#8217;t addressed. Only one in five was prescribed HRT. Too many women say that when they seek advice they are frequently dismissed or not offered HRT or other treatment options. Find out more about the Menopause Mandate here. </p>
<p>This week the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee published our report into the work of the Electoral Commission. We concluded that the recent Elections Act is a “missed opportunity” and has made electoral law more complicated. Challenges lie ahead now for the Electoral Commission in supporting voters, campaigners, and electoral administrators, to understand and navigate the changes ahead of elections in May 2023, when voters will be required to produce ID at the polls to vote. The Government need to ensure that voters, campaigners and candidates, as well as electoral administrators have all the support they need to ensure that our democracy does not suffer from the changing rules and processes. You can read the full report here.</p>

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Bradford South MP Judith Cummins has demanded that the Government act now to halt the crisis in NHS Dentistry.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Judith led a cross-party debate in the Commons, calling on the Government to take urgent steps to deal with chronic lack of access to NHS dentistry before it is too late.</p>



<p>“For the last seven years, I have spoken about the challenges, I have raised concerns, and I have sounded the alarm that NHS dentistry was facing burdens, pressures and circumstances that it simply was not equipped to handle.”</p>



<p>Leading the debate, Judith said that NHS dentistry was in urgent need of fundamental reform – but that calls for change had largely been ignored by Government:</p>



<p>“We now hear on a regular basis, from MPs on all sides of the House, from across the country, raising the concerns of their constituents who are unable to access an NHS dentist. The current system remains unfit for purpose.</p>



<p>In Bradford, 98% of dentists are closed to NHS patients forcing people to go to A&amp;E or to go private, whether they can afford to or not &#8211; often taking out a payment plan because they do not have the luxury of an NHS dentist available to them.”</p>



<p>Research by the BBC shows that 9 out of 10 dental practices in England are not taking on new NHS patients. In Yorkshire and Humber, the situation is amongst the worst in the country – with only 2% of dental practices taking on new NHS patients.</p>



<p>Shocking statistics show that a child born in Bradford is eight times more likely to be admitted to hospital with dental decay before their sixth birthday than children in the former Prime Minister’s region, the East of England.</p>



<p>Judith stated the problem was due to dramatic cuts to funding of NHS dentistry that has fallen by a third in real terms in the last decade, and a serious issue with dentists staying in the NHS.</p>



<p>“We have enough dentists – but they are working in private practice. Until government fixes the problems with the NHS contract which sees highly qualified, experienced dentists squeezed out of the system, they are simply pouring more water into a bucket with a giant hole.”</p>



<p>Speaking afterwards, Judith said: “The situation is appalling. Many of my constituents cannot get an NHS dentist. Instead, people are waiting until they are in severe pain and in a situation where they either have to pay for urgent private care they cannot afford or they end up in A&amp;E clogging up the system, because they do not have the ‘luxury’ of an NHS dentist. NHS dentistry shouldn’t be a luxury. It is a necessity.”</p>



<p>“I have called for fundamental and comprehensive reform that puts early prevention at its heart. Good oral health must not be restricted by your postcode or by your wealth. The Government knows this. I have had Minister after Minister agree that fundamental reform is needed but years on, we are still waiting for action.</p>



<p>“People are fed up of excuses and inaction. The Government needs to act.”</p>

<p>Einstein was wrong, it is possible to travel faster than the speed of light. I’m inclined to believe it as I look at the Tories rushing around trying to blame anyone but themselves for the crisis they’ve created.</p>



<p>Jeremy Hunt, the fourth Chancellor since July, is promising to steady the ship by cancelling tax cuts and introducing more austerity. After 12 years of Tory government, it’s back to the future. Working people, the elderly and the poor are going to have to pay for yet another failed experiment.</p>



<p>As we head into winter, it’s almost certain the government won’t honour the triple lock designed to protect pensioners. On Monday, the Chancellor virtually admitted to me that he won’t raise benefits in line with inflation, meaning our poorest pensioners won’t get the increase they need. They’ll get less at the very time when they require more. There won’t be a campaign to encourage almost one million pensioners entitled to pension credit but who don’t claim it. And there’s now no chance of raising the pension credit threshold to allow those living in very modest circumstances to receive a benefit which is also a passport to council tax support, rent assistance and free TV licences for the over 85s.</p>



<p>By promising huge unfunded tax cuts, the new PM spooked the markets. It’s caused a financial crisis which will hit businesses and destroy jobs, drive up mortgages and cost some people their homes. If that’s not bad enough, it’s also created a crisis in government bonds that affects pension funds with a knock-on effect that could hit pensioner incomes for years to come. Pension funds were encouraged to invest in government bonds because they were safe. People who’ve paid pension contributions all their working life trusted those decisions. The reckless actions of this government have put them at risk.</p>



<p>Can you believe the former Chancellor, who behaved like a drunk man in a casino gambling with our money, is now in line for a £17,000 pay off after only 43 disastrous days in the job. It’s time for a change.</p>

<p><strong>Local MP Grant Shapps visited Carter’s Sunflowers Specialist Nursery for children with autism, social communication needs and associated disabilities on Friday. </strong> </p>



<p>Over the course of the visit Mr Shapps heard about the establishment’s achievements and met with parents whose children attend the nursery.</p>



<p>Through its amazing work, Carter’s Sunflowers has helped many parents return to work rather than being a full-time carer – in turn improving their own mental health and wellbeing. </p>



<p>Carter’s Sunflowers supports 26 families in the Welwyn Hatfield and wider Hertfordshire area.</p>



<p>Based in Ludwick Family Club, Welwyn Garden City, the nursery is hoping to expand to provide services for more children in need.</p>



<p>“The feedback from parents today is clear – Carter&#8217;s Sunflowers is a unique place for children with specialist needs<a>,”</a> said Mr Shapps.</p>



<p>“The attention to detail from those caring for the children was incredible – I could see that they felt comfortable here”.</p>



<p>“I’m proud to be the local MP for the nursery and will be doing all I can to help find them a larger premisis so they can expand and continue their vital work.”</p>



<p>Lucy Oliveira of Carter’s Sunflowers said “we really appreciate Grant coming along today to find out more about our nursery.</p>



<p>“Having Grant on side to find a larger building is excellent news and we’re grateful for his support<a>.”</a></p>



<p>The organisation also offers special educational needs training and gives confidence to parents that their child is making progress.</p>

We&#8217;ve done sponsored walks and visits, and as they&#8217;ve developed their facilities at Redenham, I&#8217;ve dropped by the catch up. And so it was last week when I dropped in to their annual barbecue when they thank supporters and let people have a look around. The brain child of Billy MacLeod MBE, the organisation works with veterans struggling with PTSD and other mental health challenges, giving them confidence and a sense of mission in their lives.

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p><strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to you to ask for your help with a new local initiative that I have been working on with <strong>Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell, </strong>the local branch of Citizens Advice and <strong>Good Company</strong> which runs five food bank centres in Epsom and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The current energy crisis is putting huge pressures on many people locally.  Although prices are being frozen for the next two years, and every household will receive a £400 discount on their energy bills this winter, paid over a six month period, many households are still struggling with the increases that have already taken place.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to the crisis is to improve energy efficiency for those who are struggling to pay their bills. But all too often people either do not know what solutions are available or cannot afford them or both.</p>
<p>The <strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong> is a plan to offer those running into difficulties immediate help with their bills, and then advice and financial support to improve energy efficiency or reduce energy consumption in their homes and so reduce bills going forward. This might include buying a more efficient appliance for them or helping with improved insulation.</p>
<p>To help support this programme we are asking local households who have less difficulty paying for these higher energy bills to donate their £400 support payments to the fund so that it can be used to help reduce the bills of those who are struggling. If you are able to do this, we would be very grateful, and all other donations are of course also very welcome.</p>
<p>As I said, the Scheme is being run jointly by the Good Company, which runs the local food bank, and Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell helped by local Churches. It will offer both advice sessions to help those who are not sure how to improve their energy efficiency as well as assistance paying for improvements.</p>
<p>If you can help, I would be very grateful. To make a donation, please visit our donations page at <strong><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qha4CRO3xsv5RPExUNaYzD?domain=justgiving.com">www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></strong>.  If you would like any further information, please drop me an email.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to support this programme.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

              <h2><a href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/09/27/bust-budget/">Bust Budget</a></h2>
              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>On Friday the new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced what he described as a mini-budget to help deal with the cost of living crisis. The only thing mini about it was the amount of support it provides to the average family and individual in Britain. This completely un-costed budget, will give out the largest tax cuts since 1972, most of which are aimed at the wealthiest in society. That budget in 1972 lead to a short-lived boom, and a much longer bust, with the infamous three-day week and the failure of key services.</p>



<p>The tax cuts in this mini budget, are mainly for the super wealthy, for corporations and for the bankers. The top tax rate of 45p (%) has been completely removed, which is great news for those lucky few that earn over £150,000 a year. Corporation tax increases have been discarded, and the cap on bankers’ bonuses brought in after the financial crisis of 2008 have been scrapped.</p>



<p>But the Tories aren’t content with just giving handouts to the rich, they have also increased the number of Universal Credit recipients who have to actively search for work and attend weekly or fortnightly job centre appointments, if they are working up to 15 hours a week. If they don’t then their benefits will be reduced. Unsurprisingly the mini-budget also attacks trade union rights further, making it harder for working people to strike for the pay and conditions they deserve.</p>



<p>While they have suspended National Insurance increases and cut stamp duty, this support is minute compare to the support for those best off in society. Even in terms of energy bill support, prices being frozen where they are now, simply means they are only twice what they were last year, at the same time that the price for everything else from food to transport is increasing, while wages and benefits remain completely stagnant.</p>



<p>This budget does not serve the needs of the people of Nottingham, it does not help those who need help the most. People earning £20,000 will only save £167 a year. What it will do is drive Britain into an inflationary spiral. It will cause the prices of the goods that residents need to survive to increase further, at a time where benefits and wages are not rising. This will wipe out any gains that residents in the city see from this mini-budget.</p>

<p>The Tories say their budget will stimulate growth; it remains to be seen if it will. What is certain though is that growth in the economy is pointless if it does not lead to increased wages for the average person, if people are not supported to re-skill and obtain jobs in growing sectors, and if people do not have access to suitable affordable housing, whether that’s via home ownership or renting.</p>



<p>The mini budget does nothing to help achieve these aims, Nottingham Labour strongly believe that the budget will not help the people of Nottingham, it will only help a tiny minority of people. A Labour government is needed nationally to give the people of this country and of Nottingham the support and help that they need, and that they deserve.</p>

<li><strong>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan, starting a new era focused on economic growth, whilst tackling the immediate energy crisis and removing barriers for businesses to build the infrastructure we need to grow the British economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan puts more money in people’s pockets by cutting National Insurance and Income Tax – including an extra £330 a year from the cut to National Insurance contributions and saving families £1,400 on their energy bills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To deliver on this mission, the Chancellor has also announced 38 Investment Zones and over 100 infrastructure projects across the country to drive the investment and growth in the areas that need it the most.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan – setting out support for families with their energy bills and unleashing a new era of growth through tax cuts and investment incentives.</p>
<p>Matt Warman MP has welcomed the Chancellor’s measures set out for families across Boston and Skegness who will have their energy bills cut by up to £1,400 through the Energy Price Guarantee, whilst businesses eligible for The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will have their energy bills slashed by cutting the price of wholesale gas.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also confirmed people across the East Midlands will benefit from personal tax cuts – cutting National Insurance contributions by 1.25 per cent, putting an extra £330 a year in people’s pockets and helping them with cost-of-living pressures.</p>
<p>This means two million people across the East Midlands region will save £255 a year thanks to the cut to National Insurance contributions, and 2.4 million people across the East Midlands will save £160 a year thanks to the slash to Income tax in 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside these measures the Conservative Government announced further personal cuts – including cutting stamp duty permanently by doubling the nil-rate band to £250,000 (from £125,000), increasing the nil-rate band for first time buyers to £425,000 (from £300,000) and increasing the value of the property which first-time buyers can claim relief to £625,000 from (£500,000).</p>
<p>These measures combined mean a typical family moving into a semi-detached property will save £2,500 on stamp duty and £1,150 on energy bills – and if they have a combined income of £50,000 around an additional £560 on tax. This is around £4,200 in total.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan also unleashes 38 Investment Zones across England, unlocking housing and driving growth through tax incentives and over 100 infrastructure projects that will be accelerated.</p>
<p>These measures will unleash growth through tax cuts and reform, tackle the immediate energy crisis, removing barriers for business, and building the infrastructure needed to grow the British economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman MP said:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong>“In the face of rising energy prices and cost of living pressures it is right that this Conservative Government has come forward with a serious support package and a plan for growth.</em></p>
<p><em>“I welcome support set out for people across Boston and Skegness today, including cuts to National Insurance contributions, Income Tax and Stamp Duty – all helping families to keep more of their hard-earned money.</em></p>
<p><em>“Only the Conservatives can be trusted to make the reforms we need to grow our economy – delivering higher wages, lower taxes and more money for our public services.”</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Commenting, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Growth is not as high as it should be. This has made it harder to pay for public services, requiring taxes to rise and cost of living pressures to increase.</em></p>
<p><em>“We need to change this and be unashamed in our Growth Plan – expanding the supply side of the economy, through tax incentives and reform, whilst we help families now by cutting their energy bills by £1,400 a year and slashing personal taxes.</em></p>
<p><em>“That is how we will deliver higher wages, greater opportunities, and crucially, fund public services, now and into the future.”</em></p>

<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">We’ll let you know when it’s your turn and where you need to go. There is no need to contact the health board or your GP to ask for an appointment. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">Please be patient.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">If you’re eligible, you’ll receive an invite to have the booster at one location. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">This could be one of our local vaccination centres (Canolfan Gorseinon or Aberafan Shopping Centre), a community pharmacy or your GP surgery.</span></p>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Semua game di bawah satu atap</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.</p>
<p>Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.</p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
