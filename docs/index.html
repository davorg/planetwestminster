<p>On the floor of the House of Commons this afternoon, South Lakes MP Tim Farron secured a meeting with the Minister for Schools, Nick Gibb, to discuss how the Government can support the outdoor education sector in Cumbria.</p>
<p>Speaking during an Education Statement in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"A couple of weeks ago I was at the Bendrigg Trust outdoor education centre in my constituency, and it was a massive joy to see residential activities slowly starting again, with young people getting the benefits of outdoor education. It is a reminder of two things.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"First, 6,000 of the 15,000 people who worked in outdoor education at the beginning of the pandemic have now lost their jobs, and because of a lack of a specific bespoke package to support those centres, many have closed and many more are on the cusp of closing.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Secondly, our outdoor education specialists in Cumbria and around the country have a unique set of skills that we need to deploy at this very moment, to encourage young people to re-engage with learning, and reignite a love of learning.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"What will the Right Honourable Gentleman do specifically to commission outdoor education centres to do that, out in mainstream schools, and will he meet me and some outdoor education specialists so that we can explain how that could be done?"</em>
</p>
<p>Responding, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: <em>"The best thing we can do to help those outdoor centres is ensure that their doors can open to welcome not just day visitors, but those who want to stay there on a residential basis.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"We will continue to look at what other measures we can introduce to support the sector. I know the value and enrichment that comes from doing so many activities, whether on Lake Windermere or in many other excellent locations around the country, and it brings real benefit.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I am sure that my Right Honourable Friend the Minister for School Standards would be happy to meet the Honourable Gentleman and his colleagues."</em>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last month Nottingham City Council outlined its vision for the area East of the Victoria Centre  as far as St Mary’s Rest Garden and Victoria Park and down to Sneinton Market, which includes parts of the Creative Quarter.  This has been set out with the publication of  what is known as the Nottingham Eastside Supplementary Planning Document (SPD).<br><br>The Eastside SPD has multiple aims including promoting balanced communities but also providing planners with material policy considerations to demand safer and more sustainable development, fully integrating in it the council’s 2028 zero carbon target. It’s pieces of legislation like this that make Nottingham City stand out. The SPD builds on the concept of the ‘20 minute neighbourhood’, which aims to boost the local economy by keeping jobs and money local, to improve the health and wellbeing of Nottingham Residents by promoting healthy and sustainable life habits such as walking and cycling, and to celebrate and promote our green spaces and to create spaces for people of all ages to enjoy. </p>



<p>If there was
a lesson learned during the pandemic that is that our built environment and
public spaces need to reflect our need for healthier living and cleaner air.
That means making a radical leap forward to a less carbon-dependent future.
It’s policies such as this SPD that contribute towards achieving better
outcomes for Nottingham residents in the long-term. Whilst direct electric
heating is introduced for most new development and there is usually a focus on
building fabric to achieve sustainable outcomes, this policy will allow, when
possible, for the use of advanced technology to achieve energy efficiency in
new buildings, such as ground source heat pumps and PVs.</p>



<p>The
East-side SPD also introduces a lot more protection for built heritage assets
in the area it covers, including heritage at risk. More means are provided to
planners to protect locally listed buildings that may not be listed by historic
England, but are celebrated by members of the public for their history, their
distinctive character and design.</p>



<p>The Eastside
area that the SPD covers stretches from the prysm club, all the way to the
Sneinton market and the creative quarter. The area covered by the SPD has seen
a lot of change over the centuries, and the SPD is a document that once adopted
will add further safeguards for its history ancient and modern. Why is that
significant?</p>



<p>It is if we
take into account that the area under the eastside includes what’s left from
the Viking occupation, including Viking burial grounds with Viking graves still
surviving, it also includes the remnants of a medieval settlement including
medieval town defences, as well as a medieval hospital. There is also a high
likelihood that there are caves under the Eastside area, which is one of our
distinctive treasures as a city. The SPD is important as it adds checks and
balances to ensure that underground archeology does not become subject to harm
from future development.</p>



<p>The area
covered by the SPD’s history was affected by two key developments which very
much explain the way it looks today. One was the enclosure act 1845 after which
land north-east of the region including St Anns became open to development. That
land was previously part of the Clayfield and could not be developed. The
Enclosure act however gave way to the building of industrial housing and slums
there, most of which were cleared during nation-wide slum clearances taking
place from the early 20th century up until the 1970s. That’s when arterial
roads became wider, and Lower Parliament Street and Huntington Street were
formed.</p>



<p>The East
side includes significant 19th century buildings and sites that survive today,
including St Mary’s rest garden and the Victoria Park (originally part of the
clayfield), Park View Court flats, the clock tower from the Victoria baths
(which currently forms the Victoria Leisure Centre), the ragged school on Bath
street as well as the New Foresters Arms that survived the clearance policies.
In terms of early 20th century buildings of significance, they include the
Palais de Danse (Prysm club), the salvation army’s memorial hall, the art deco
styled Huntington street garage, and of course the Sneinton market which,
although older, in its current form resembles its 1930’s modernised planning
and design.</p>



<p>The SPD is aimed to create balanced communities, promote sustainable and healthy living, protect our heritage, and ultimately create places Nottingham people love to live in. The consultation will be starting very soon and it&#8217;s a great opportunity for everyone to have their say on what the future should look like for the Eastside!</p>

<p><strong>ONLY INDEPENDENCE CAN PROTECT SCOTLAND FROM LASTING BREXIT DAMAGE</strong></p>
<p>The SNP has panned the Tory government for wasting £160,000 of taxpayers’ money on recruiting a so-called ‘Brexit Opportunities Director’.</p>
<p>Drew Hendry MP said the public would be astonished that the Tories are throwing away even more taxpayers’ money on Brexit, having already cost the UK billions of pounds since the EU referendum.</p>
<p>The UK government has paid a recruitment firm £43,000 to help employ a Director – who will earn an annual salary of £120,000 per year.</p>
<p>Commenting, Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s beggar&#8217;s belief that the Tory government is whittling away another £160,000 of taxpayers’ money on a Brexit bureaucrat, having already cost Scotland billions of pounds through their Brexit obsession.</p>
<p>“Boris Johnson’s hard Brexit has been a disaster for Scotland &#8211; hammering our economy with mountains of added costs, red tape, and barriers to trade with our European neighbours &#8211; a market seven times the size of the UK.</p>
<p>“There have been no upsides to Brexit &#8211; just a growing list of downsides, and it speaks volumes that five years on from the EU referendum the Tory government has yet to identify a single meaningful benefit among the sea of broken promises.</p>
<p>“The only way to keep Scotland safe from the long-term damage of Brexit is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to secure a strong, fair and equal recovery and regain the economic benefits of EU membership.”</p>

<p>    I could see the point of Test and trace when few people were vaccinated and when rising caseloads could lead to a surge in people with serious illness needing hospital help. Today now the vaccines seem to have broken most of the link between case numbers, hospital patient numbers and deaths it is less clear that the current Test and Trace system is sensible.</p>
<p>      Test and Trace always had weaknesses, largely based on individual reactions to it. Some people did  not download the app and never liked the system. It could not be mandatory as not everyone has a mobile phone and there was  no way people could be made to keep a charged phone by their side every day 24 hours a day. Some who downloaded the app then declined to take any incoming call which might have been a warning call from the system to get them to self isolate. Others took the call, promised to co-operate but found compliance too difficult.</p>
<p>       Most people with jobs and family duties are not in an easy  position to go home and stay home for 14 days. Few have a fortnight&#8217;s supply of good food ready. Many need the income from working and not all can do everything from their home. Many have to do things outside the home to look after other family members. The ask of Test and Trace was simply too high for some  who were not ill, did not feel they had it or were going to get it, and were unsure why they had been told to self isolate in the first place.  I hear  details are scarce about where and how you were in contact for those who were approached. This is  for understandable reasons as the app has to reassure on privacy about who went where and  when.</p>
<p>       Today there is the danger that the Test and Trace system generates far too many precautionary requirements to self isolate for many people who do not have the disease and are not about to have it. The rules need relaxing as we learn &#8220;to live with the disease&#8221; as the government says. No major country has succeeded in eliminating CV 19, even those who have had more severe and longer lockdowns than us. The best advice surely is to ask  people who feel ill with likely symptoms  to get tested, and to stay isolated if they turn out to have it. </p>

<p>That’s why I really appreciated the opportunity to catch up with the wonderful Julia Nix (East Anglia District Manager for the DWP) this past Friday – to hear from her about the challenges being faced because of Covid, as well as the great opportunities already arising for many jobseekers in our region.</p>

<p>One topic we discussed at length was the opportunities available to many 18-24 year olds, particularly through the Kickstart scheme. Having seen many education leavers unable to find work through the pandemic, I was pleased to hear what our outstanding local DWP is doing to ensure they can now get a foot in the labour market – one that enables them to push on, thrive and ultimately succeed.</p>

<p>Julia and her team do brilliant work, and I look forward to visiting them in person at the local jobcentres in the months and weeks ahead.</p></div>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has today backed the Labour party’s pledge to make, buy and sell more in Britain.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Labour have unveiled a plan to raise standards, award more public contracts to British businesses and bring the jobs of the future to the UK. Labour will use the social and environmental stretch clauses in public contracts to raise standards, mirroring the approach taken in other countries including France and the US.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Labour’s new proposal will seize the opportunities for the long term of the post-pandemic, post-Brexit economy and help to shape a more secure future for Britain, especially in the green and tech sectors of the future.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Labour will make more in Britain by giving more public contracts to British companies, big and small, by:<span class="x_apple-converted-space"> </span> </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Asking every public body to give more contracts to British firms big and small, using stretching social, environmental and labour clauses in contract design to raise standards and spend and make more in Britain.<span class="x_apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Passing a law requiring public bodies to report on how much they are buying from British businesses including SMEs.<span class="x_apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Leading a culture change in government, putting the growth of local industries first, and reviewing the pipeline of all major infrastructure projects to explore how to increase the materials made in Britain, upskill workers to get the jobs of the future.<span class="x_apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Labour will help bring jobs of the future to Britain, by:<span class="x_apple-converted-space"> </span> </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Investing in reshoring jobs in the same way we invest in Foreign Direct Investment, by helping every business considering reshoring access the expertise and support they need.<span class="x_apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Working with colleges and universities to make sure we’re honing the skills and apprenticeships for the jobs of the future.</li>

<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really proud to be backing this pledge. As we recover from the pandemic, we have a chance to build a fairer and better future for Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Across Denton and Reddish there are so many incredible businesses that need our support, and Greater Manchester is leading the way in green tech and environmental solutions.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>It&#8217;s so important, therefore, that we make the most of this wealth of talent and give more public contracts to British companies, big and small. We need to invest in Britain and bring security and resilience back to our economy. Labour is the only party with a credible plan to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon I welcomed Alun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, to Neath as part of his South Wales Community Walkabout tour. We were accompanied by Inspector Matt Otteson, Cllr Leanne Jones, Sergeant Carys Lewis, Cllr Dean Cawsey and Sarah Mahon, Engagement Officer SWP, as we walked around Neath town centre. In the short time available to us, with consideration to Mr Michael’s busy schedule, we visited the railway station, market, Ambassador Hotel, and Victoria Gardens, and listened to many people who approached us as we walked around Neath. Mr Michael will schedule another visit in the near future.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, as the Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Sport, I was a panelist at the <a href="https://www.sportandrecreation.org.uk/news/politics/introducing-our-speakers-for-the-policy-playb">Sport and Recreation Alliance Conference</a> looking at the policy making landscape in the UK. Sport has been a very important part of my life. I went to judo classes from 11 years of age. I was awarded a junior black belt at 12, a senior black belt at 13, and retired as a 4th Dan at 19. I was a member of the Great Britain Youth Team to the Munich Olympic Games. I played many sports at comprehensive school, including tennis and hockey. I discovered squash in my early twenties and played over 100 times for Wales. I worked as a national coach for Squash Wales and I’m still the only racket sports coach to have been awarded the Sport Wales Female Coach of the Year. The panel discussion focussed on the role of Parliament and Government in setting and influencing sports policy and the different arms and reach of each. The role of MPs and Peers in checking, challenging and influencing policy. The parliamentary options for influencing policy, and their strengths and weaknesses. When and how to engage ministers and parliamentarians, and the role of devolved administrations. The panel was chaired by Leigh Thompson, Head of Policy at the Sport and Recreation Alliance, and I was joined on the panel by the former chair of the APPG for Sport Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield. There were over 100 sports organisations taking part in the event. Government ministers make policy, whereas backbenchers use Commons debates, Westminster Hall debates, written and oral questions, Urgent Questions, Select Committees, Private Members Bills, APPGs, and write letters to ministers. I’ve been in opposition since being elected in 2015, used most of these Parliamentary procedures to raise issues, and worked cross-party in collaboration with backbenchers from other parties to try and influence policy, but as a Conservative MP, Ben has the advantage of being able to have a direct line to most Conservative Government ministers.</p>
<p>Most backbench MPs apply to be drawn in the ballot to be called by the Speaker at <u><a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1410233246164598786">Prime Minister’s Questions</a> </u>held every Wednesday at 12 noon. Last week was the first time that I have been fortunate to be drawn. I told the PM that my constituents were angered by the treatment of DVLA staff and in particular the disgraceful online harassment of PCS Union rep Sarah Evans. And with cases rising significantly in South Wales in the third wave of the pandemic, I asked him why he feels it acceptable for the DVLA to have returned over 450 staff to their Swansea site, contrary to UK Government advice, as some can and have been working effectively and safely from home. The PM didn’t have a clue what was going on at the DVLA and quoted statistics that he couldn’t back up. Disappointingly, he did not respond to the point I raised about Sarah Evans.</p>
<p>I subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1410990065808031748">wrote</a> to the PM on 2nd July, informing him of the current case rate at the DVLA, thus correcting the record. And informing him that a further 120 staff on fixed term contracts have also been brought back on site that day, which does not indicate that staff safety is a priority for the DVLA. I asked him to make it clear to the DVLA that the unwarranted online abuse of Sarah Evans was completely unacceptable, and asked him to make this clear to the DVLA. I also asked the PM to make sure that the agreement reached by PCS Union and senior management at the Department of Transport, which was suddenly withdrawn without explanation on 1st June, should be satisfactorily concluded.</p>
<p>Wednesday evening saw a last minute u-turn by the UK Government over the proposed removal of steel safeguard tariffs on cheap steel imports. Based on recommendations from the independent Trade Remedies Authority (TRA), the UK Government was set to remove 9 of the 19 safeguards at midnight, when other countries were renewing their safeguards. I spoke in the Commons debate called by the Labour Party on 21st June urging the UK Government not to accept the TRA recommendations. On 30th June, with only 5 hours to the deadline, the UK Government announced that the 5 most important safeguards would be extended for a further year, and that the decision powers of the TRA would be reviewed. This is a huge victory, but I will be demanding that the UK Government’s review should consider reforming the TRA to represent views of workers and industry, and to consider the impact of its decisions on communities in Neath. And we need a long-term plan for investment and modernisation to make the UK a world leader in low carbon steel production, putting British steel at the heart of every major infrastructure project.</p>
<p>On Thursday I became an officer of the new All Party Parliamentary Group on Banning Trophy Hunting. Roger Gale MP was elected chair. The Secretary is Eduardo Gonclaves, former chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, and founder of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, an eminent author of books on this subject, who has spent 30 years opposing cruelty to animals. Trophy Hunting is a form of hunting in which the hunter’s explicit goal is to obtain the hunted animal’s carcass or body part, such as hide or head, as a trophy to represent the success of the hunt. I have long campaigned against trophy hunting, and importation. Since the 1980’s British hunters have imported approximately 25,000 hunting trophies into the UK and about 5,000 were from species at risk of extinction. Hunting Trophy Imports of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) increased by 79% in 2019 – the latest data available. The UK Government propose to introduce a ban on imports of trophies from endangered species, based largely on the EU’s Wildlife Trade Regulations plus endangered/critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. But we are concerned that there may be loopholes in the Bill, for example, the “blood money” exemption whereby a wealthy British trophy hunter would be allowed to shoot and import a trophy of an endangered animal provided they paid a substantial fee to ostensibly “support conservation”, which was controversially first applied in the US to allow this to happen to Black Rhinos, classed as Critically Endangered by IUCN. A March 2021 survey by Survation found only 4% of the public supported this exemption whilst 85% opposed it. And 85% of UK voters believed a trophy ban should apply to all species, but only 3% wanted it to apply to only endangered species. The UK Government may publish a draft Bill before recess, which we will scrutinise, and lay amendments to try and close any loopholes.</p>
<p>On Saturday I was honoured to present the Lifetime achievement awards at the British Indian Orthopaedic Society (BIOS) online conference. It was my good fortune 15 years ago to be referred to Mr Amit Chandratreya with my self-inflicted knee problems due to a lifetime of playing all types of sport. Amit and I became friends and his innovative BIOS treatment improved my quality of life considerably. Through Amit I learned of the tremendous work of the BIOS and I was so proud to host an event for BIOS in Parliament in pre-Covid times, and I hope to repeat the event when Parliamentary restrictions permit. I presented the first Lifetime award to Mr Amit Sinha who has worked for the past 22 years in North Wales. Amit was born in a remote village in Bihar, India, and after qualifying, came to Rhyl as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Amit has held many positions including President of the Welsh Orthopaedic Society from 2015-17 and President of the BIOS from 2010-2013. I presented the second Life award to Mr Srirama Murti Gollapudi born in Vishakhapatnam, India, moving to Wakefield, Yorkshire in 1980, after working as an assistant professor in Orthopaedics at Andhra Medical College. Murti was a founder of the Indian Orthopaedic Society and worked towards it becoming BIOS in 2016. He was instrumental in the educational role of BIOS and the annual Indo-British travelling fellowships. In retirement he learnt to play the piano and is compiling a travelogue of his past 15 years. I presented the BIOS Rearch Recognition award to Mr Kodali Prasard from Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, who is an acclaimed researcher, editor, and peer reviewer in the international arena of trauma and orthopaedic surgery by the application of clinical practice and research, which enriches both in pursuit of excellence. Kodali graduated from Guntur Medical College, Andhra Pradesh and was awarded the Special Merit Scholarship for top scholars from 1966-72. He joined the NHS in 1978, has been at Prince Charles Hospital since 1994, and is the first and only International Assistant Editor and only Editorial Board member from the UK and India for Foot and Ankle International and Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research. He has been selected an unprecedented three times as an elite reviewer for the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. He has won several international awards including the Mahatma Gandhi Samman award, and been involved with BIOS for many years.</p>
<p>The Samaritans annual Talk to Us campaign began this week, to raise awareness of the vital work the charity carries out and their 24/7availability for anyone struggling who may need a chat.  Branches across the UK will be holding local events in aid of the campaign, so keep an eye on social media for details of what the local branch have planned.  If you’re interested in supporting the cause by raising funds, the Samarathon is taking place all month, with the aim to run, jog or walk 26.2 miles over 31 days.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to welcome Kim Leadbeater as Labour’s newest MP for Batley and Spen. Kim ran an amazing campaign, even in the face of some really nasty and personal attacks from other candidates, and her passion for the constituency – previously represented by her sister, Jo Cox – and its residents, really shone through.  Batley and Spen thoroughly rejected the politics of hate and division and I’m looking forward to seeing Kim in Parliament next Monday.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues that fall under my role as an MP and want to get in touch, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

<p>In this week’s Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee session, we heard from a number of political parties, large and small, about reform necessary within the Electoral Commission. This is an important subject as without a well-governed electoral process, we undermine Parliament and the work that we do. We heard about politically-nominated board members on the Electoral Commission and whether they should remain party members or whether they should be impartial. They were introduced because it was felt that the Commission should have members with experience in politics and it was suggested that the Commission should make better use of political appointments.  However, it&#8217;s clear that there is some disagreement between the party representatives on the value of politically-nominated appointments.  Whatever the appointment system, there should be a broad range of political views represented.</p>
<p>I was pleased to meet with Councillor Tom Renhard, the Bristol Council Member for Housing Delivery and Homes, to discuss housing in Bristol South this week. The Council is by far the largest landlord in the constituency with over 9000 residential properties and more than a fifth of the Bristol South constituency as tenants. Housing is by far the most common reason for constituents to reach out to my office for support and there are many challenges to work on in the coming months and years. Among them are new housing developments, the delayed review of Homechoice, potential housing stock replacement, and outstanding repairs which have been delayed by the Covid pandemic. We had a very fruitful discussion and I await updates on a number of issues, including an important recovery plan to address the outstanding repairs and complaints that have been raised by tenants during the pandemic. Everyone should have a safe and comfortable home and it is important that the Council ensures that its provision is of a high standard and sufficient to meet the demand.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, the job market was a challenging place for young people starting out in their careers after education. The Chancellor’s Kickstart scheme was heralded as the answer to youth unemployment, but it is simply too slow and does not match the scale of challenge many young people in the UK face. Since the start of the pandemic there has been a large increase in unemployment and a large fall in employment for young people aged 16-24, nearly two-thirds of all workers who lost their job during the pandemic were aged under 25, and the number of people aged 16-64 claiming unemployment related benefits has doubled in a year, all of which much be incredibly dispiriting and upsetting for young people. The Government aims to have created at least 250,000 Kickstart placements by the end of the year. However, on the 3rd June, only 31,000 young people had started placements. At this rate, they would not reach their target until Sep 2026. Education and getting our young people into good work placements or apprenticeships are vital for our short-term recovery and long-term prosperity.  The Government simply must do more to ensure this generation are not left behind.</p>
<p>I am growing ever more concerned about the Government’s short-sighted attacks on our support for international development. As the only G7 nation to cut aid, breaking a manifesto commitment to support the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people, this Tory Government are retreating from our moral duty and people will lose their lives as a result. Our allies and detractors are already taking note and this will further weaken the UK’s position ahead of the G7, an education summit and COP26 &#8211; all of which we are hosting later this year. The aid budget should be used to tackle the global challenges facing us all; the pandemic, climate crisis, and rising poverty and inequality. We will not be safe from Covid or the next pandemic if vaccines are reserved for the richest countries. We will not be safe from climate change if we do not support the poorest countries to make the changes that will support our work on protecting the environment. We will not be safe from international terrorism, from instability that is never isolated in one region, from piracy around the world if we do not support the poorest people across the world to redress the imbalance and support development. It is becoming increasingly clear that “Global Britain” is nothing more than an empty slogan.</p>
<p>It was brilliant to see Kim Leadbeater elected as Labour’s newest MP in Batley and Spen this week.  Her amazing campaign reached out across the constituency, rejecting the politics of hate and division and bringing people together.  I’m looking forward to seeing her in Parliament!</p>
<p>There are opportunities within my office, both in London and in Bristol South. I am looking for a <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/15/vacancy-personal-assistant/">Personal Assistant</a> with excellent communication skills and experience of managing a complex diary to support my work in Westminster and a part-time <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/06/15/vacancy-caseworker/">Caseworker</a> to join my constituency team in Bristol South. Closing date for applications is 5 July with a view to starting in the middle of August.</p>

<p>Last month, the Boundary Commission released their proposals for changes to the borders of the parliamentary constituencies.</p>

<p>Boundary Reviews happen routinely to address demographic changes over time, to ensure that constituency sizes are broadly equal. The last review was based on the number of electors at the 2000 General Election. But clearly, over twenty years on, as the population of the country has grown and areas have become more or less densely populated, this can lead to big discrepancies in the number of electors in each constituency.</p>

<p>To show how diverse this can be, at the 2019 General Election the Bristol West constituency had 99,253 electors, whereas our neighbour Montgomeryshire had only 48,997. Both return one MP – so clearly, not all votes carry the same weight in electing their MP. So this latest review from the Boundary Commission is long coming, and necessary.</p>

<p>The initial proposals involve some change to the Ludlow Constituency – not least a proposed name change, to ‘Ludlow and Bridgnorth’. The Shropshire Council wards of Burnell and Severn Valley – currently part of the Shrewsbury & Atcham constituency – would be included in the new Ludlow and Bridgnorth constituency. This would increase its geographic area significantly – by over 100 square miles, to some 700 square miles, which would make it the 5th largest constituency in England by area. It would also increase the number of electors by 7,500, over 10% on current levels, to some 77,000 electors.</p>

<p>This is however markedly less change than the previous iteration of the proposals from the Boundary Commission, which would have split the Ludlow Constituency in three, part of which would have created a new seat of Ludlow and Leominster in Herefordshire.</p>

<p>The current proposals keep five constituencies in Shropshire and Telford, and do not cross other county boundaries. The rest of Shropshire sees some limited movement of Shropshire Council wards, to ensure all constituencies have between 75,000 and 77,000 electors, with the exception of Telford, which would initially have 70,000, providing some room for this high growth town to increase its electors in years to come.</p>

<p>Across the West Midlands, there are no changes to the number of constituencies in Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Coventry, and Birmingham and Solihull. Staffordshire and the Black Country reduces from 25 constituencies to 23. So the West Midlands reduces overall from 57 constituencies to 55.</p>

<p>I stress these are just initial proposals. The Boundary Commission will report with their final recommendations by 1st July 2023, but there will be revisions off the back of feedback from MPs and the public. The public can have their say now through the current consultation, which finishes on 2nd August.</p>

<p>I shall be studying the detail closely, and I would also welcome feedback from constituents on the proposals, in particular the proposed change of name. You can access my survey on my website <a href="http://www.tellphilip.com/">www.tellphilip.com</a> to let me know your views.</p></div>

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, chaired a further virtual meeting with local farmers and representatives from the Environment Agency (EA), East Riding Council (ERYC) and the National Farmers Union (NFU) to follow up on the discussion they had in April about flooded farmland. Graham was joined by Sir Greg Knight, Chairman of Hull River Board and a neighbouring MP, whose farmers are similarly affected.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency reported on the River Hull bathymetric Survey, which had highlighted a number of focus areas for more investigation and which will become the subject of bids for Government funding. Farmers welcomed the further opportunity to raise their continuing concerns and individual experiences, and to put questions to the EA.</p>
<p>It was concluded that once a clear proposal is put together, the group will be in a position to make a strong case to various private and public bodies to secure funding. Graham looks forward to chairing another follow up meeting in September to hear an update from the EA about their assessments, solutions and costings, so that next steps can be confirmed.</p>

<p>Graham said, “We had a really successful meeting and it is clear that a joint approach is the best way forward. I was delighted to be joined by Sir Greg and farmers in his constituency to help drive momentum on the importance of reducing the effects of flooding that local farmers have been experiencing for several years. I look forward to reconvening in September when I hope we can make real progress and solidify our next steps.”</p>
<p>Sir Greg said, “Clearly more needs to be done and Graham and I are keen to ensure that a coordinated approach is pursued so that all options to reduce flooding locally are properly examined.”</p>
<p>Paul Stockhill, Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager at the EA, said “We were grateful to have the opportunity to share the findings from our survey of the River Hull. There are some locations we want to look into further, where we can see ‘humps’ in the river bed level. We will conduct further sampling, to establish if these are a result of silt build up, or natural features such as chalk and rock. </p>
<p>“We will continue to share the results of our findings in this forum, as we collectively gain a better understanding about this complex water network.</p>
<p>“It remains important to recognise the funding challenges faced in investing in low lying, drained areas like the upper River Hull. We welcome Graham’s work in helping bring together communities and partners, which will be crucial if any work is to be progressed.”</p>
<p>John Duggleby, who farms at Beswick, said, “I am very grateful for our two local MPs, Sir Greg Knight and Graham Stuart, being so supportive of our case for procuring extra funds from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – the upper Hull is in a desperate state.”</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>In a letter to the Building Safety Minister, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, has asked whether the Government plans to fully address the building safety scandal given the Building Safety Fund (BSF), designed to fund remediation works for unsafe buildings, excludes many fire safety faults. </p>
<p>In her letter, Gill challenges the Government over omissions in its building safety plans which could leave many homes unsafe and unsellable even after works have been completed, as well as blameless leaseholders with multi-million-pound bills to complete the job. </p>
<p>Gill warns that four years on from the Grenfell tragedy, Government plans to fix the cladding scandal face further delays due to “roadblocks of its own design”. She says: “Leaseholders can’t be expected to live in unsafe conditions in homes that have been rendered uninsurable and unsellable due to fire risks for which they bear no blame.” </p>
<p>The Government has previously stated on multiple occasions that leaseholders would not be made to pay for this crisis. However, despite extensive lobbying, its Building Safety Fund excludes many fire safety faults from eligibility for funding, such as defects with balconies, insulation, and fire breaks. The Government has warned that remediation works must be ready to start on site by 30th September 2021 or risk losing funding.   </p>
<p>Gill asks if Government “would expect applicants to move forward with partial remediation projects that do not address the full gamut of fire safety faults that have been identified, despite this undoubtedly inflating overall costs, or would MHCLG withhold funding until on site work is able to begin in full?”  </p>
<p>With a long list of questions, much still unknown to thousands of anxious leaseholders and lives at risk, Ms Gill hopes to see more urgency as well as clear responses from Government. </p>

<p>At the end of last week the Black Country Core Strategy was published. <strong>The proposed plan has left me shocked at the sheer scale of development being proposed for my constituency. </strong></p>
<p>At its heart the proposal <u>should</u> have been looking at viable opportunities to provide housing and employment across our communities on appropriate local sites.</p>
<p>Instead, the proposal simply seeks to drive a coach and horses through the green lungs of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>
<p><strong>The proposed development on our precious Green Belt is unacceptable to me and I know from the many emails that I have already received on this matter that it is unacceptable to you too.</strong></p>
<p>I am still of the firm belief that there are an adequate number of brownfield sites across the Black Country which should be developed first instead of forging ahead with the wholesale destruction of our  Green Belt and Open Spaces.</p>
<p>That’s why I will be questioning the housing allocation numbers and asking why it is that my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and the wider Walsall area are being expected to do the heavy lifting and why we are being asked to take a disproportionate number of houses.</p>
<p>Whilst at this stage the Black Country Plan is only a ‘proposal, it remains extremely important that when the consultation starts in August we all feed in our views.</p>
<p>When I have further information about the consultation I will update you all.</p>
<p>However, please be assured that I will be opposing this plan on behalf of the residents of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of joining campaigners outside of Parliament for the Travel Day of Action, fighting against the Government’s handling of covid travel restrictions.</p>



<p>I met with South Shields based travel agent, Graeme Brett, owner of Westoe Travel to discuss the ongoing challenges facing the travel industry. Graeme attended alongside a wide range of organisations from across the aviation and travel industries aiming to put pressure on the Government to support a safe return to international travel in time for the peak summer period.</p>



<p>The travel industry has been let down badly throughout the pandemic and the Government must provide sector-specific support and finance to all those affected. No other industry has been left in the dark like this and we’re going to see more and more travel agencies getting boarded up and people losing their jobs if we don’t act.</p>



<p>I believe the current traffic light system doesn’t work, it sends unclear messages to both business and travellers. With the promotion of clear and consistent public health messages and good measures in place, international travel could return.</p>



<p>Last week I voted against the extension of the covid roadmap restrictions. The virus will be with us for the long haul and repeated lockdowns and constant restrictions is not a long-term strategy. I believe we need to make a start reopening safe international travel and reap the benefits of our country’s vaccination programme.</p>



<p>For all who have lost their jobs and are fighting to re-open travel, I will continue to fight with you.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p>Residents on Scalpay are back online after nearly two months of service disruption.</p>



<p>Scalpay Community Council contacted Angus MacNeil MP to alert him to the disruption faced by around 20 households who were affected by an ongoing broadband problem.</p>



<p>The disruption to service was causing problems for those working from home due to Covid-19 restrictions and for local businesses.</p>



<p>Kenny Macleod, Secretary of Scalpay Community Council, and one of those affected, said: “After weeks of being given different stories and being told it was fixed, we got in touch with our MP, Mr MacNeil, and are very grateful for his intervention which has undoubtedly speeded up the resolution of our problems.&nbsp; If he hadn’t intervened and got the engineers onto the ferry, we would probably still be waiting for it to be fixed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are all hugely dependant on a good, reliable internet connection and not having it for so long caused lots of problems. Hopefully now these are resolved.”</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil had contacted Openreach to try to push forward a solution and was very pleased when it was confirmed to him that a team was set to travel to the island imminently to work on this issue.</p>



<p>Openreach then contacted Mr MacNeil for assistance due to the difficulties they were facing in securing a ferry booking to the island and Mr MacNeil then contacted Calmac to stress the urgency of the situation and a ferry booking was made.</p>



<p>A team carried out works and although not all issues have been overcome, households have now been reconnected.</p>



<p>The engineers replaced the dishes on the 18Ghz radio link at both ends, but they are still waiting on parts for the 32g link which need to be replaced.</p>



<p>Additional works are due to be carried out to increase speeds when parts arrive, however Openreach state there are no live faults in this area and services are now operating as normal.</p>



<p>Openreach are also looking at providing additional weatherproofing to try and stop the problems occurring again.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased that I was able to assist the community on Scalpay in moving towards a resolution to this problem which was causing disruption to everyday life and was understandably frustrating for residents.</p>



<p>“I cannot fix all problems which constituents raise with me, but I would encourage people to get in touch and I will do all I can to assist.”</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Later today, Labour will try to stop the Tories selling
out the British steel industry by forcing a decision to retain vital
protections, with a motion to Parliament empowering Keir Starmer to put forward
emergency legislation to extend the UK’s current safeguards against cheap steel
imports.&nbsp; I will be voting in favour of this proposal.</p>



<p>Before 30 June, the Tory International Trade Secretary
will decide whether to push&nbsp;ahead with plans&nbsp;to remove nine of the
current 19 safeguards. The EU has extended its own&nbsp;steel&nbsp;safeguards
until at least June 2024, and the US is also expected to do so.</p>



<p>The risks for the UK’s steel industry are great if the
Tories press on. There is a surplus of&nbsp;steel&nbsp;in China and the excess
of&nbsp;steel&nbsp;on the international market has pushed prices down. If
safeguards are removed, the UK’s&nbsp;steel&nbsp;industry faces being dwarfed
by competitors. Just a 2% increase in global overproduction could totally wipe
out demand for British&nbsp;steel.</p>



<p>Slashing safeguards and opening the floodgates to cheap
steel imports would be devastating for steel plants across the country.</p>

It’s also lovely to note that lots of school children were involved in creating these murals.</p>
<p>It supports something I’ve been saying for a long time- if you want people to active travel, their surroundings need to be pleasant, and well looked after. I’ve cycled through these subways quite a lot and I’ve got to say they’re looking so much better. My congratulations to all involved.”</p>
<p>Phil Bibby, Herts County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport, said: “Improving these subways in Hatfield is part of a wider programme to encourage active travel and reduce car use across the county.</p>
<p>Walking and cycling have so many direct benefits to both physical and mental health, and if everyone made a few more journeys on foot or bike, and a few less in the car, that would have a big impact on air quality, and therefore on everyone’s health. That’s why improving routes like these is so important to us.”</p>
<p>Next stop for Mr Shapps was Stanborough School in Welwyn Garden City, where he met with Headteacher Merry John to tour the school, check on its progress, and open a newly completed Music &amp; Drama block.</p>
<p>The opening, at which teachers, governors and students attended, Mrs John said: “This new block is a fantastic base for our young musicians and performers- they deserve the best. I’m really pleased to see that during lunchtime, during lessons, it’s a thriving place for our students. Thank you so much to Grant for being able to join us for the official opening.”</p></div>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with another update about the Coronavirus pandemic and some other local issues.</p>
<p>Firstly, as you will probably be aware, the Prime Minister has taken a decision to extend the remaining restrictions until the end of the 18th July.</p>
<p>CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS</p>
<p>A summary of the current rules is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<p>WEDDINGS AND CIVIL PARTNERSHIP CEREMONIES</p>
<p>There are two exceptions to this. The first is that the limit of 30 people allowed to attend a wedding has been removed, though a number of conditions remain.</p>
<p>Full details of this are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-wedding-and-civil-partnership-ceremonies-receptions-and-celebrations"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>CARE HOME RESIDENTS</p>
<p>In addition care home residents are now allowed to spend a night away from their homes without having to isolate on their return.</p>
<p>Details are here:<br />
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/care-home-residents-can-stay-overnight-as-visiting-restrictions-ease</p>
<p>SURREY COVID CASES</p>
<p>The recent increase in cases in Surrey has mostly affected younger people who are yet to be vaccinated and those who have only had a single jab. This does underline how important it is that people who are still unvaccinated or who have yet to book in for their second jab and are eligible to do so book an appointment now. You can do so via the NHS website at;</p>
<p>https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/</p>
<p>The latest figures for Surrey are <a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/263691/Surrey_covid-19_infographic_1106.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>CHALK PIT EPSOM</p>
<p>I know many people remain extremely concerned about the noise and dust nuisance coming from the Chalk Pit in College Road, Epsom at the moment. I have been working with local residents on the issue and pushing the Environment Agency to act. I have had several meetings with the Agency and they have been working through a formal process which I hope will reach a resolution in the next few days. Please keep updating me if you experience serious noise or dust from the site.</p>
<p>CITIZENS ADVICE</p>
<p>The Epsom and Ewell Citizens Advice team have asked me to remind people that if they are having difficulties as a result of the pandemic or some other issue, they are often able to help.</p>
<p>For their latest details and contacts <a href="http://www.caee.org.uk/get-advice/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I very much hope that we can move on from the pandemic very soon and everyone will be able to enjoy the rest of the summer. As always, if you have questions or issues please feel free to email me, though please use my Parliamentary address as this message comes from a no reply service.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris Grayling</p>

Member of Parliament for Epsom and Ewell</p>

<p>Reacting to news that Bradford Bulls will now continue to run an Elite Academy, Bradford South Labour MP Judith Cummins said, “I’m pleased that the club and the RFL have reached a resolution that enables Bradford to continue to run an Elite Academy.”</p>



<p>“It would, however, have been better for all concerned to have avoided the worry and trauma in the first place,” she added.</p>



<p>Ms Cummins had challenged the RFL on the process and decision that saw Bradford losing out in the award of Elite Academy licences. She questioned whether quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and deep roots into the community game had been given little weight in the consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Bulls Academy has been productive and respected for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.</p>



<p>There remain challenges ahead but I’m looking forward to working with and supporting the club and the RFL to make sure that the sport has a healthy future,” said Ms Cummins.</p>

<p>I was delighted to formally open the brand new Melksham Hub Café the other week. The café and community space at Melksham Railway Station is located in a former commercial depot building and is a fantastic addition to the railway station. There is an extensive menu, and from today you can eat in as well as takeaway.</p>



<p>This is an amazing community effort involving Wiltshire Council, Melksham Area Board, TransWilts and commercial partners Knorr-Bremse as well many others to make Melksham Railway Station a really attractive and user friendly place to travel to and from the town, be sure to check it out!</p>

<p>As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.</p>



<p>We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.</p>



<p>While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Please don&#8217;t hesitate to&nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.</p>



<p><strong>Birmingham Coronavirus Update</strong></p>



<p>Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:</p>



<ul><li>Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group</li><li>Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE</li><li>The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household</li><li>Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&#8217;s handling of the pandemic</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.</p>



<p>Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>You can read the full letter <a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Support for a nurses pay rise</strong></p>



<p>Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all they&#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Celebrating St Patrick&#8217;s Day</strong></p>



<p>This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.</p>



<p>Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.</p>



<p>I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fighting to safeguard employment</strong></strong></p>



<p>Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.</p>



<p>Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.</p>



<p>Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.</p>



<p>You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: <a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography.

I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
