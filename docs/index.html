<p>The Prime Minister was right to want to keep the UK corporation tax rate at the lower end of the advanced countries tax table. We need to carry on attracting large investment  flows into our country and leaving domestic businesses with more of their profits to put into new investment.</p>
<p>It appears the PM has been persuaded to row back on this promise of her election campaign to “ensure economic stability”. I do not think this measure does that. After the 2.30 announcement yesterday  there was a sharp sell off in long bonds. Interest  rates on the 50 year paper rose by more than 0.4% or 40 basis points. As the PM’s critics wrongly think the UK bond  markets currently move on changes of government policy they need to explain why when the PM did the main thing they wanted the bonds sold off sharply. Maybe long bond movements in recent days have more to do with Bank of England management of the market.</p>
<p>Sterling was unchanged after the announcement instead of rising as her critics implied.</p>
<p>Instead of changing individual items in the tax proposals the new Treasury team needs to bring forward the spending proposals and show us forecasts of the deficit. We need a menu of tax and spend options with prices to influence and judge the full budget and fleshed out growth plan. The PM promised MPs a series of meetings and consultations over the next week preparatory to the full budget. These talks need the government to keep open tax cuts as well as increased spending on priorities and cuts elsewhere. If they have already taken the key decisions the talks are pointless.</p>
<p>I am all in favour of actions to get the deficit down.I have been forecasting a higher deficit this year than the £99 bn OBR budget estimate. To control it I would look first as the biggest change by far that the new PM has announced, the energy package. It should remain very supportive for people on low incomes, but there could be more burden sharing for higher earners who burn a lot more fuel.</p>

<div class="elementToProof"><b>Responding to Liz Truss sacking her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, Andrew Gwynne said: </b></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today Liz Truss has sacked her Chancellor for implementing her own policies. She has done this in a shameless attempt to save her own skin after her disastrous mini budget crashed the economy and sent mortgage rates soaring. Her decision means that Jeremy Hunt becomes the 4th Tory Chancellor this year. This isn&#8217;t a stable or sustainable government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz Truss developed the mini-budget with her Chancellor. She signed off on every last detail &#8211; including the 45p tax cut for the super-rich &#8211; which she then had to backtrack on. She now thinks that by changing Chancellor she can dodge accountability for her own actions. She is taking the British public for fools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is the damage has been done. It is too little, too late. Working people will be paying the price of this crisis made in Downing Street for years to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories have gambled with our economy and gambled with lives and livelihoods. They&#8217;ve done so against the advice of economists from across the political spectrum, and without a proper forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Conservative Party has proven that they are totally ill-equipped to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Only Labour offers the leadership, ideas and ambition to repair our economy and build a fairer, more prosperous Britain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The new Home Secretary’s been having a go at the police. She says she’ll make them attend the home of every victim of burglary. It sounds like a crowd pleaser on first hearing but, as a policeman friend of mine pointed out, even if they drop everything else, current resources suggest it would mean about thirty seconds per visit. This Home Secretary’s not living in the real world.</p>



<p>Our police are already severely overstretched and struggling to cope with all kinds of crime. I’m dealing with a couple of complaints right now. The first involves two cars stolen, one with a tracker attached, on the same evening from the same house in an area where there’s been a spate of such thefts. It took several days to recover them, and both were badly damaged. Most likely a gang is operating in the area. A surveillance operation might be the answer but they’re costly and used sparingly in a region this size. I’ve also been alerted to an issue involving an individual brandishing a firearm where there are question marks about the response. I’m surprised because the West Midlands has the second highest number of gun offences, by population, in the country.</p>



<p>If the Home Secretary is going to directly supervise policing perhaps, she’ll consider the two issues I’ve raised. </p>



<p>I’m bound to ask, however, what is the point of Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners if she intends to make all the decisions. Surely, it’s their job to consult and agree priorities, prepare a policing plan and operationalise it. I’d recommend they take more time to explain the facts about just how much money the Government allows them, so people know what to expect.</p>



<p>It’s time for Suella to forget party conference soundbites and concentrate on building back police numbers to the level the Tories inherited from Labour in 2010, while also ensuring they’re properly paid and resourced.</p>



<p>We all want to see more criminals caught and more crime prevented, but it’s a bit rich for the Home Secretary to lecture police officers about problems her government created.</p>

<p>Conference Recess was a great opportunity to visit local businesses and organisations in the constituency, but Parliament has now returned and I was able to contribute to the debate on the situation in Iran following the tragic death of Mahsa Amini. The debate took place on the UN’s International Day of the Girl. It was deeply concerning that the Minister’s answer did not focus on the myriad challenges that girls face. Those women in Iran are an inspiration to girls across the world. Beyond commenting on sanctions, the Minister did not say much about how the Government are supporting wider civil society. These women and teenage girls in so many cases, are incredibly brave and an inspiration, but we must do more than merely send best wishes and sanction the Iranian Government. We must support the wider civil society movement to help them fight for the rights they want to see and develop a society with whom we can cooperate and be on friendly terms with. These women and girls deserve this at the very least.</p>
<p>I’ve been busy with various meetings this week, including the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the British Irish Parliamentary Association. The former committee is vital in scrutinising the Government’s actions and holding them to account. We have been finalising our inquiries into the Electoral Services Commission and Governing England and should be ready to conclude the inquiries soon.</p>
<p>Today I’ve been out and about in the community canvassing, and it’s been great to chat to people in the streets and on the doorstep about the issues that are concerning them and what opportunities we are all keen to unlock. It’s clear that the cost-of-living crisis is foremost in people’s minds and there are huge concerns about how people are going to keep comfortable this winter with the cost of energy bills. This week we received new polling data from Survation for 38 Degrees. It is deeply troubling to see that 61% of Bristol South residents fear that they won’t be able to afford their energy bills next year. 32% worry that they will have to resort to food banks within a year and a staggering 25% fear homelessness within a year.</p>
<p>It’s become clear that there are a lot of words coming from this Tory Government, but when push comes to shove there is nothing forthcoming. We are heading for a difficult winter that will not only affect people’s finances but also their health. I will keep working to demand more from this Government and to remember their pledges to help hard-working people during this crisis.</p>
<p>We should never forget, nor forgive, the Tory Government for their actions in wrecking the UK economy. Mortgages are rising at astronomical rates because of their Mini-Budget and their decision to close our nations gas storage facilities has put us in danger of blackouts this winter.</p>
<p>Written Questions are a weapon in the arsenal of MPs to hold the Government to account. I asked about recent discussions the Government has had with Adult Social Care providers on the impact of rising energy prices on care sector stability. For those will care needs, simply turning off the electricity or reducing usage is simply not an option. The Government response was lacking: “Officials regularly engage with adult social care providers and representative bodies to discuss the impact of rising energy prices and the Government’s New Energy Bill Relief Scheme.” What will be the impact? I want to know what the Government expect to happen with the Adult Care Sector and what plans they are putting in place to deal with the problems that arise. Warm words will not keep the heating on. You can read more about the questions I ask and the responses I get <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/member/4444/writtenquestions#expand-1507290">here</a>.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A new Dental School in Norwich would ensure </span></span>that our region has some of the next generation of dentists being trained locally, and would also mean that existing dentists can begin to specialise in specific dental fields so as to strengthen the pool of skills available locally to patients (making them more likely to remain in the East, as well as attracting more dentists to the region). </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Some of the most cutting edge and pioneering dental science is already being developed here in the East too. We should be doing all we can to ensure that science is being piloted here, with our own dentists leading the way in delivering it.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>That’s why I am so firmly behind this campaign. It’s vital that we tackle the major shortage of NHS dentists in the region. (And, as we know, statistically, students that study at the likes of UEA and the University of the Arts are far more likely to settle locally than students elsewhere in the country. I believe we would see the same occurring were a Dental School established here).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to do all I can on this campaign – providing further updates on my website campaign page </span></span><a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/nhs-dentists"><span>here</span></a>.</span></span></p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>South Shropshire MP, Philip Dunne is encouraging the public to consider recommendations from the Conservative Environment Network on how households can reduce their domestic energy consumption.</p>

<p>Dunne said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We are all paying the cost of the global crisis caused by President Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>“The Government are taking action. The Energy Price Guarantee will ensure that the typical three-bedroom household’s energy bill will be capped at £2,500 per year for the next two years. But there are practical steps we can all take to reduce our energy use and keep our bills down.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Conservative Environment Network’s recommended top tips to save energy are:-</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>1. Reduce your boiler flow temperatures</strong></p>

<ul><li>Turning down the flow temperature on your combi boiler to 60°c or below can knock £112 off your heating bill each year and reduce energy waste from your home. This will cut bills without sacrificing warmth.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>2. Tweak your thermostat</strong></p>

<ul><li>Most households have their thermostat set at between 18°c and 22°c - the recommended temperature is 18°c. Turning your thermostat down by one degree can save 10% on your energy bill and could save up to £128 per year on your energy bill.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>3. Switch to low-energy light bulbs, like LEDs.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Lighting makes up 11% of the average UK household electricity consumption, so making the switch could help you save money too. Switching from 100 watt incandescent bulbs to LEDs could save £15 per bulb per year.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>4. Bleed your radiators</strong></p>

<ul><li>Trapped air can make your radiators less efficient, so they'll be slower to heat up, meaning the radiators may need to be on for longer and use more energy. Residents can do this easily themselves.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>5. Switch to a smart heating system</strong></p>

<ul><li>Installing a timer on your boiler or switching to a smart heating system could help save energy by turning on the boiler only when necessary. They could also allow more flexibility to fit in with day-to-day weather changes.</li>
	<li>Based on a typical three-bed semi-detached house, there is a potential saving of £75 a year by installing a thermostat, timed programmer and thermostatic radiator valves.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>6. Draught-proof</strong></p>

<ul><li>Draught-proofing around windows and doors could save you around £60 a year. If you have an open chimney, draught-proofing your chimney when you’re not using it could save around £90 a year.</li>
</ul><p>Dunne added,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“These energy saving tips can help households to keep energy use low, saving family’s monthly budgets and helping to reduce pressures on national energy supply for the benefit of us all”.</p>

<p>According to the Department for International Trade, the Government's recent trade deal with Australia will hit Britain's farming, forestry and fishing industry by £94m.</p>
<p>The President of the National Farmers Union, Minette Batters, said that the trade deals with Australia and New Zealand had "felt like a betrayal", with farmers "used as a pawn" to get agreements rushed through.</p>
<p>Speaking during a Westminster Hall debate on Parliamentary scrutiny of trade deals, Tim said: <em>"Most MPs on both sides of the House wanted Parliament to do its job better than it was allowed to, particularly on the New Zealand and Australia trade deals.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Better scrutiny means that Parliament should be able to sign off the negotiating mandate, and then sign off the deal itself.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Surely, we have a right as a country to dictate the terms on human rights, animal welfare, environmental issues and carbon reduction. They should surely underpin the negotiating mandate of any trade deal. Then, when a vote is taken, it must not be taken after the damage has been done.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Free trade is important, but we must not throw our farmers under the bus in the process. Free trade that is not fair is not free in the first place."</em>

<p>Yesterday in Parliament, Judith asked to meet with the Treasury Minister and the Chancellor to discuss the regeneration bid for Bradford South.</p>



<p>Speaking in Parliament at Treasury Questions, Judith Cummins MP asked Treasury Minister Felicity Buchan MP what measures the Government was taking to deliver on the Levelling Up Agenda in full.</p>



<p>Questioning the Minister, Judith asked:</p>



<p>“Building on the back of Bradford’s City of Culture win, and in this momentous year for Rugby League, I am supporting the plan for the transformation and regeneration of the home of the Bradford Bulls, the iconic Odsal Stadium, to become a world-class sports, music and culture arena.</p>



<p>“This plan would be an incubator for the ambitions of the entire Bradford district, delivering over a billion pounds worth of socio-economic benefits. Following the Bank of England’s repeated interventions, can the minister confirm the Levelling Up Fund Round 2 will still be going ahead in full, and will the Minister and the Chancellor demonstrate this by meeting with me, Bradford Council, the Bradford Bulls and the RFL to discuss our catalyst for growth?”</p>



<p>Responding, the Treasury Minister confirmed: “We will be going ahead with second round of the levelling up fund in full, and there should be decisions by the end of the year. I wish her well in her bid and there is an independent assessment going on with the bids at the moment, if it is possible to meet then we would do that.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/22316192.odsal-biggest-stadium-permanent-roof-country-new-plans/">Judith has supported the £50million bid to regenerate the Odsal area of Bradford South</a> delivering a world-class music, culture, and sport arena, a park and ride car park, and a sports training complex, with pitches for local groups to use, generating almost five hundred full time jobs, and creating long-term opportunities in the constituency.</p>



<p>Speaking afterwards, Judith said: “This is a once in a generation opportunity to deliver on Levelling Up for the people of Bradford South. Our ambitious £50 million bid would deliver investment directly into the area, giving my constituents better local services, more job opportunities and access to a world-class sport and music venue.</p>



<p>“Independent analysis repeatedly identifies Bradford as the strongest economic candidate for levelling up. We’ve heard a lot from the government over the last few years and seen little delivery. I look forward to meeting with the Treasury to discuss our bid further and to push for the investment in Bradford South that we need and deserve.”</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">I often write about supporting families worried about the cost-of-living crisis in these articles. I do so because these issues matter in a big way to local households.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That sometimes means other vital issues don&#8217;t make this column but are very important to local residents. One such issue is the poor bus service across the city and the wider area.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be clear: people should have regular and reliable public transport – anything less is unacceptable.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Without drivers, Stagecoach is struggling to keep services moving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is frustrating for you and for them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As much as we understand they cannot fix the national recruitment issue, we can ask for better. That includes communicating effectively with residents about delays and service disruptions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To ease the situation, we also need to improve traffic flow to help services connect more efficiently. That&#8217;s why the city needs an urgent agreement reached on the Raigmore Bus Gate and key infrastructure projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue coming up when I speak with local families is the frustrations over local parks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Having a safe place for our children to play in &#8211; especially as parents face a cost-of-living crisis – should be a priority for us all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we get it; there is no easy solution.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every community has its own case, and the Council doesn&#8217;t have the money to do it all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There might not be an easy answer, but there will be an imperfect one if we preserve together and cut some of the red tape.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot commit seriously to delivering an aspirational vision for the future and not commit to helping fix the issues blighting the city today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">None of us has a magic wand, but we can work together to find innovative ways to improve our amenities and services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We need to be ambitious about the future of our city, and the plans for the future are exciting. To succeed, however, we need to listen to communities now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our passion to deliver a modern green transport system in the future must be equalled by our passion to ensure today&#8217;s transport links get folk to and from their jobs and appointments on time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our commitment to build a family-friendly city for the future should be matched by our commitment to ensuring a safe place for your kids to play today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is, after all, the very least our communities should expect.</p>

              <h3>Martin Docherty (West Dunbartonshire)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p>MP for West Dunbartonshire Martin Docherty-Hughes is calling on new Prime Minister Liz Truss to give the right to paid leave for parents who experience miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>



<p>Ahead of the second reading of the Miscarriage Leave Bill in the Commons, local SNP MP Martin has signed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12cGYQY-4wlq9j0MkgrW2mnZbS9PymtUR/view?usp=sharing">cross-party letter </a>to Prime Minister Liz Truss and Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Jacob Rees-Mogg calling for the UK government to review its position and back the Bill.</p>



<p>If successful, the Miscarriage Leave Bill would introduce a statutory right for parents to a minimum of three-days paid leave in the event of a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or molar pregnancy.</p>



<p>The letter has been supported by 50 MPs from eight parties and independents as well as the Miscarriage Association, Mumsnet, Miscarriage Support, the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, Tommy’s, Sands, SiMBA and campaigner Keeley Lengthorn.</p>



<p>Introduced by SNP MP Angela Crawley (Lanark and Hamilton East) under the Ten Minute Rule, the Miscarriage Leave Bill is set to&nbsp;receive its second reading in December.</p>



<p>Up to one in four pregnancies will end in miscarriage however, there is currently no provision in place to support grieving parents through their loss&nbsp;before 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>



<p>Countries including Australia and New Zealand have already introduced paid miscarriage leave and Northern Ireland is set to do so before&nbsp;2026.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>“There are many families in West Dunbartonshire who have gone through a miscarriage. It can be a devastating experience and there should be no concerns about having to take sick leave from work.</p>



<p>“I hope the Prime Minister listens to our campaign. I will be pressing the UK government to support the Miscarriage Leave Bill when it returns to the Commons for its second reading.</p>



<p>“By offering a statutory right to paid leave for parents who experience miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy, the UK can take a positive step towards ending the stigma associated with pregnancy loss.</p>



<p>““There is no cut off point for grief so there should not be a cut off point for providing&nbsp;support to parents who experience miscarriage.”</p>



<p><strong>SNP MP Angela Crawley added:</strong></p>



<p>“A new Prime Minister brings a change to the heart of government and with that there is an opportunity for them to review and change their stance on miscarriage leave.</p>



<p>“My Private Members’ Bill will return to the Commons in December and I am hopeful that the new government will get behind it and support parents who experience miscarriage.</p>



<p>“By providing a statutory right to paid leave in the event of a miscarriage, we can challenge the stigma and allow parents to properly grieve their loss.”</p>



<p><strong>Miscarriage Association National Director Ruth Bender Atik said:</strong></p>



<p>“For many people, miscarriage is the loss of a baby, however early it happens, and is often felt as a bereavement like any other.</p>



<p>“A period of statutory leave would not only allow people some time off to start their recovery, but it would also be a clear public recognition that pregnancy loss can have a very real and significant impact on those going through it.</p>



<p>“We wholeheartedly support this bill and hope the Government will take this opportunity to support people at a what can be an extremely difficult and distressing time.”</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p><strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to you to ask for your help with a new local initiative that I have been working on with <strong>Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell, </strong>the local branch of Citizens Advice and <strong>Good Company</strong> which runs five food bank centres in Epsom and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The current energy crisis is putting huge pressures on many people locally.  Although prices are being frozen for the next two years, and every household will receive a £400 discount on their energy bills this winter, paid over a six month period, many households are still struggling with the increases that have already taken place.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to the crisis is to improve energy efficiency for those who are struggling to pay their bills. But all too often people either do not know what solutions are available or cannot afford them or both.</p>
<p>The <strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong> is a plan to offer those running into difficulties immediate help with their bills, and then advice and financial support to improve energy efficiency or reduce energy consumption in their homes and so reduce bills going forward. This might include buying a more efficient appliance for them or helping with improved insulation.</p>
<p>To help support this programme we are asking local households who have less difficulty paying for these higher energy bills to donate their £400 support payments to the fund so that it can be used to help reduce the bills of those who are struggling. If you are able to do this, we would be very grateful, and all other donations are of course also very welcome.</p>
<p>As I said, the Scheme is being run jointly by the Good Company, which runs the local food bank, and Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell helped by local Churches. It will offer both advice sessions to help those who are not sure how to improve their energy efficiency as well as assistance paying for improvements.</p>
<p>If you can help, I would be very grateful. To make a donation, please visit our donations page at <strong><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qha4CRO3xsv5RPExUNaYzD?domain=justgiving.com">www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></strong>.  If you would like any further information, please drop me an email.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to support this programme.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

<p>“There are decades where nothing happens and there are
weeks where decades happen.”</p>



<p>None more so than last month when in the space of only a
few days we saw the appointment of our fourth Prime Minister in the last six
years quickly followed by the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>



<p>The Queen was a loyal and faithful public servant who
took her responsibilities seriously, dedicating her life to serving the British
people.&nbsp; An influential figure and a
much-loved, reassuring presence for many generations, she will be greatly
missed.</p>



<p>Her successor, King Charles III, will now need to show
the same level of empathy and understanding as he faces up to the years ahead
as Head of State not only for the United Kingdom but for many other countries
around the world too.&nbsp; His surefootedness
in the days immediately after her death, whilst at the same time grieving the
loss of her not only as a monarch but, more importantly, as his mother was a
positive start.</p>



<p>Now the official mourning period has ended, he has a
clear time window in which to set out his stall as the new King.&nbsp; The next few months will be key.&nbsp; What happens in the coming days and weeks
will decide how he is received by the public and how he will be judged for the
remainder of his reign.</p>



<p>The same can be said, of course, about Liz Truss, our new
Prime Minister.&nbsp; After what seemed to be
a never-ending summer of debate within the Tory Party, she finally emerged as
the victorious candidate.</p>



<p>Taking office at one of the most turbulent times in
recent history, she had only two days inside 10 Downing Street before everything
was turned upside down by the news coming from Balmoral.&nbsp; In that brief time, she had already set about
appointing the least experienced, most extreme Cabinet she could think of.&nbsp; Jettisoning to the backbenches anyone who had
not shown complete and utter devotion to her previously, it seems personal
loyalty came before any sense of assembling the best talents for the new PM.</p>



<p>Her only major announcement before the suspension of Parliament
was on energy prices with a proposal for an energy price guarantee so that the
average domestic energy bill will be no more than £2,500 per year for two years
from October 2022.&nbsp; Totally avoiding any
questions relating to the overall cost of this policy, Truss also failed to
outline that her plans would in fact see richer people receiving twice the
amount of help than the poorest.&nbsp; Neither
fair nor particularly effective.</p>



<p>I am pleased that the Prime Minister has finally accepted
the principle of a price limit. However, under her Government’s plan prices
will still rise considerably. The plan put forward by Labour, on the other
hand, would ensure that there would not be a single penny more on bills.</p>



<p>There is also a crucial question about who pays for these
measures. The Treasury estimates that energy companies could make £170 billion
in unexpected windfall profits over the next two years. That is why I have
supported a windfall tax since January and why I want to see the windfall tax
expanded.&nbsp; Sadly, the Prime Minister has chosen to leave these vast
profits on the table and instead let working people pick up the bill.</p>



<p>In addition to the cost of living crisis, the new Prime
Minister will have to deal with other pressing matters including how to prevent the expected NHS crisis in
England, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, finding a way through the Northern
Ireland Protocol difficulties and dealing with our Net Zero by 2050 climate
change commitments whilst securing our energy supply for the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With
polling suggesting that voters become less impressed with her, the more they
see of her, she has a huge challenge to set convince the British public that
she can really make a difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How will it all work
out?&nbsp; Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Mr MacNeil also warned that reports from the Prime Minister Liz Truss that no household would pay more than £2500 were inaccurate and had led to the spread of misinformation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He said: “Householders should take a meter reading by October 1 and then submit it to your energy provider. The reading does not have to be submitted on that day as this has previously crashed the systems but please ensure that meter readings are taken and noted, even take a photo of the reading for evidence, and then submit within a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nobody wants the September usage to be estimated into October usage because it will be a higher price. Also, in October you will be using more electricity.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday the leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer gave a great speech at party conference setting out his vision for Britain under a Labour Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be a Britain with its hope back, it’s confidence back… it’s future back. A country where aspiration is rewarded. Where working people succeed. A force for good in the world. A clean energy superpower.</p>
<p>The fully funded policies announced in the speech to&nbsp; grow our economy and spread opportunity throughout the country stands in stark contrast to the shambolic budget that we saw last week from the conservatives.</p>
<p>Labour is ready for government.</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>

<p>On Friday the new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced what he described as a mini-budget to help deal with the cost of living crisis. The only thing mini about it was the amount of support it provides to the average family and individual in Britain. This completely un-costed budget, will give out the largest tax cuts since 1972, most of which are aimed at the wealthiest in society. That budget in 1972 lead to a short-lived boom, and a much longer bust, with the infamous three-day week and the failure of key services.</p>



<p>The tax cuts in this mini budget, are mainly for the super wealthy, for corporations and for the bankers. The top tax rate of 45p (%) has been completely removed, which is great news for those lucky few that earn over £150,000 a year. Corporation tax increases have been discarded, and the cap on bankers’ bonuses brought in after the financial crisis of 2008 have been scrapped.</p>



<p>But the Tories aren’t content with just giving handouts to the rich, they have also increased the number of Universal Credit recipients who have to actively search for work and attend weekly or fortnightly job centre appointments, if they are working up to 15 hours a week. If they don’t then their benefits will be reduced. Unsurprisingly the mini-budget also attacks trade union rights further, making it harder for working people to strike for the pay and conditions they deserve.</p>



<p>While they have suspended National Insurance increases and cut stamp duty, this support is minute compare to the support for those best off in society. Even in terms of energy bill support, prices being frozen where they are now, simply means they are only twice what they were last year, at the same time that the price for everything else from food to transport is increasing, while wages and benefits remain completely stagnant.</p>



<p>This budget does not serve the needs of the people of Nottingham, it does not help those who need help the most. People earning £20,000 will only save £167 a year. What it will do is drive Britain into an inflationary spiral. It will cause the prices of the goods that residents need to survive to increase further, at a time where benefits and wages are not rising. This will wipe out any gains that residents in the city see from this mini-budget.</p>

<p>The Tories say their budget will stimulate growth; it remains to be seen if it will. What is certain though is that growth in the economy is pointless if it does not lead to increased wages for the average person, if people are not supported to re-skill and obtain jobs in growing sectors, and if people do not have access to suitable affordable housing, whether that’s via home ownership or renting.</p>



<p>The mini budget does nothing to help achieve these aims, Nottingham Labour strongly believe that the budget will not help the people of Nottingham, it will only help a tiny minority of people. A Labour government is needed nationally to give the people of this country and of Nottingham the support and help that they need, and that they deserve.</p>

<li><strong>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan, starting a new era focused on economic growth, whilst tackling the immediate energy crisis and removing barriers for businesses to build the infrastructure we need to grow the British economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan puts more money in people’s pockets by cutting National Insurance and Income Tax – including an extra £330 a year from the cut to National Insurance contributions and saving families £1,400 on their energy bills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To deliver on this mission, the Chancellor has also announced 38 Investment Zones and over 100 infrastructure projects across the country to drive the investment and growth in the areas that need it the most.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan – setting out support for families with their energy bills and unleashing a new era of growth through tax cuts and investment incentives.</p>
<p>Matt Warman MP has welcomed the Chancellor’s measures set out for families across Boston and Skegness who will have their energy bills cut by up to £1,400 through the Energy Price Guarantee, whilst businesses eligible for The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will have their energy bills slashed by cutting the price of wholesale gas.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also confirmed people across the East Midlands will benefit from personal tax cuts – cutting National Insurance contributions by 1.25 per cent, putting an extra £330 a year in people’s pockets and helping them with cost-of-living pressures.</p>
<p>This means two million people across the East Midlands region will save £255 a year thanks to the cut to National Insurance contributions, and 2.4 million people across the East Midlands will save £160 a year thanks to the slash to Income tax in 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside these measures the Conservative Government announced further personal cuts – including cutting stamp duty permanently by doubling the nil-rate band to £250,000 (from £125,000), increasing the nil-rate band for first time buyers to £425,000 (from £300,000) and increasing the value of the property which first-time buyers can claim relief to £625,000 from (£500,000).</p>
<p>These measures combined mean a typical family moving into a semi-detached property will save £2,500 on stamp duty and £1,150 on energy bills – and if they have a combined income of £50,000 around an additional £560 on tax. This is around £4,200 in total.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan also unleashes 38 Investment Zones across England, unlocking housing and driving growth through tax incentives and over 100 infrastructure projects that will be accelerated.</p>
<p>These measures will unleash growth through tax cuts and reform, tackle the immediate energy crisis, removing barriers for business, and building the infrastructure needed to grow the British economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman MP said:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong>“In the face of rising energy prices and cost of living pressures it is right that this Conservative Government has come forward with a serious support package and a plan for growth.</em></p>
<p><em>“I welcome support set out for people across Boston and Skegness today, including cuts to National Insurance contributions, Income Tax and Stamp Duty – all helping families to keep more of their hard-earned money.</em></p>
<p><em>“Only the Conservatives can be trusted to make the reforms we need to grow our economy – delivering higher wages, lower taxes and more money for our public services.”</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Commenting, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Growth is not as high as it should be. This has made it harder to pay for public services, requiring taxes to rise and cost of living pressures to increase.</em></p>
<p><em>“We need to change this and be unashamed in our Growth Plan – expanding the supply side of the economy, through tax incentives and reform, whilst we help families now by cutting their energy bills by £1,400 a year and slashing personal taxes.</em></p>
<p><em>“That is how we will deliver higher wages, greater opportunities, and crucially, fund public services, now and into the future.”</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Like many in this House, I had the opportunity to meet and speak to the Queen on numerous occasions, but unfortunately the relationship did not start particularly auspiciously. I was invited to Buckingham Palace for what, as other Members will know, is an ancient, complex process of becoming a Privy Councillor. It was so complicated that I was called to a side room with five colleagues to have the process explained. We were told, &#8216;You will enter a large hall in Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty will stand at one end. You will kneel on the red cushions, which go back some distance, on your right knees, holding a Bible in your right hand. You will switch that to your left hand, then take the Sovereign’s hand with your right hand and brush her hand, then stand and say, ‘Your Majesty.&#8217; I thought, &#8216;Brush her hand? Was that an instruction to brush her hand with my hand? With my sleeve? Or with a handkerchief?&#8217; As I was about to ask, we were called into the performance of the great ceremony itself. I thought, &#8216;No matter, I am fifth in the line to become a Privy Councillor, so I will watch my colleagues.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;My colleagues were all swearing on the New Testament, but as I am Jewish I was swearing on the Old Testament. I was at the back of the line and I thought that I would watch what was happening. Unfortunately, as we went into this large hallway, I found that it was so long that I could not see what was happening in the ceremony at the front. As I got closer, the field of view narrowed and the girth of my colleague in front of me widened, and I still could not see what brushing the hand actually entailed. With palpitations, I nervously knelt in front of Her Majesty The Queen, on the red cushion right before her. I switched the Bible, the Pentateuch, from my right to my left hand, and stretched out my right hand. She stretched out her bare, ungloved right hand and, to my surprise, moved it towards my face. It moved towards my lips. I pursed my lips. And it stuck! For what felt like an age she tried to pull it away and then, suddenly, “pop!”, her hand pulled away. I wanted the ground beneath me in Buckingham Palace to swallow me whole, but I remembered to stand up. &#8216;Your Majesty,&#8217; I quavered. She looked me right in the eyes with those wonderful sparkling eyes, as if both to acknowledge what had happened and also to forgive me in one turn. She said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217;. Mr Speaker, we never spoke of it again. </p>



<p>&#8220;God save the King.&#8221;</p>

<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">The roll out of the Covid autumn booster vaccine begins today (Thursday, September 1st) in Wales.</span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">Those who are eligible will be invited to have it this autumn. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">We’ll let you know when it’s your turn and where you need to go. There is no need to contact the health board or your GP to ask for an appointment. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">Please be patient.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">If you’re eligible, you’ll receive an invite to have the booster at one location. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">This could be one of our local vaccination centres (Canolfan Gorseinon or Aberafan Shopping Centre), a community pharmacy or your GP surgery.</span></p>

<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">If you’re missing a booster you’ll move on to receive your autumn booster only, as this will be sufficient to increase your protection. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">The Covid autumn booster will support the immunity of those who are at greatest risk from the disease, improving their protection against severe illness and helping to protect the NHS during what is likely to be another challenging winter.</span></p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my August email newsletter. It has been an eventful few weeks in British politics, with the resignation of Boris Johnson launching a leadership contest in which we are now in the final stage. Conservative Party members up and down the country will now decide whether Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss will become the next Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister.</p>



<p>In this newsletter, you will find updates on: the Conservative Party leadership contest, local bus services, my work with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, local community action projects, and my annual summer survey to hear what you think.</p>



<h1>Leadership contest &#8211; and online poll:</h1>



<p>As&nbsp;you will be aware, Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister on the 7th July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his time in office, Boris Johnson achieved much, getting Brexit done; organising one of the fastest Covid-19 vaccination programs in the world; and supporting Ukraine against the unprovoked aggression of Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is now a process that must be followed to select the next Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. This process involves the Parliamentary Conservative Party selecting two final candidates through a series of votes. These two candidates are now&nbsp;put to a vote with all members of the Conservative Party up and down the country, and the winner of this vote becomes the leader of the party and Prime Minister. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been selected as the final two candidates to enter the vote with Conservative Party members.</p>



<p>At the beginning of this leadership campaign, I created a poll to better understand your views on the candidates and your favourite to become leader and Prime Minister. We had a fantastic response to that poll, and I would like to thank those of you who took the time to complete it.</p>



<p>Now that we are in the final stage of the leadership election, with Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss selected as the final two candidates, I have created another poll for you to share your views about these two candidates. Like the previous poll, it should only take a minute or two to complete and I would be very interested to learn what you think about the final candidates.</p>



<p>You can find the poll <a href="https://nigelmillsmp.com/conservative-leadership-poll/">here</a>.</p>



<h1>Transpeak bus service:</h1>



<p>I am pleased to inform residents that the Transpeak bus connecting Derby and Buxton, through Belper and Ambergate, will continue. The service was due to be reduced to just one bus a day in each direction from Sunday, 10th July onwards. However, thanks to a funding boost from Derbyshire County Council the bus will continue to run at the same level of service as before – once an hour from Monday to Saturday, and once every two hours on Sunday.</p>



<p>The bus is set to be subsidised for up to 6 months to allow time for passenger numbers to recover, as they are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. I have been calling for Government funding to be used by Derbyshire County Council to maintain existing services for some time, so I thoroughly welcome this decision.</p>



<p>I know residents have also raised the issue of the 1A bus service through Waingroves with me, so I&#8217;ve also been raising this issue with the County Council. </p>



<h1>The Organisation for Security &amp; Co-operation in Europe:</h1>



<p>From the 2nd-6th July, I attended the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) annual session in Birmingham, in which over 300 delegates from 56 parliaments met to discuss the future of international security in Europe. In the face of Russia’s barbaric and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the current state of security and co-operation in Europe is at its most precarious since the end of the cold war. Summits like these are, therefore, absolutely vital for maintaining cooperation and order throughout Europe and the rest of the world.</p>



<p>I attended as a member of a cross-party delegation of 10 MPs and Peers led by John Whittingdale MP. During the session, the Parliamentary Assembly strongly denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Agreeing upon a resolution that “calls upon the Russian Federation to establish an immediate ceasefire and withdraw Russian troops from the whole of Ukraine.”</p>



<p>Further committee sessions discussed human rights, victims of terror attacks, the role of non-governmental organisations, economic growth following Covid-19, sustainable energy, and recent increases in migration. The OSCE stands for lasting security in Eurasia through justice, problem-solving and development. The Parliamentary Assembly enables the strengthening of common values between the countries involved, particularly in times of international crisis. It is, therefore, a great privilege to be involved and to support this vial work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1>National Citizen Service visit:</h1>



<p>On the 8<sup>th</sup> July I met with a&nbsp;group of young people from the National Citizen Service (NCS) in Alfreton. The National Citizen Service is a voluntary program for 15–17 year-olds offering real world experience as well as opportunities for personal development. The program normally runs in the summer and consists of a week staying away from home working on social action projects that benefit the community. It is a great way for young people to make new friends and accomplish something to be proud of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a real pleasure to meet the NCS group in Alfreton and hear about their projects that are actively improving local communities, and to discuss a range of interesting questions they’d prepared. The group had been organising a fund-raising event at the Miners Arms to raise money for Ashgate Hospice, which turned out to be a brilliant success.</p>



<p>If you would like to learn more about NCS and how to get involved, <a href="https://wearencs.com/">click here.</a></p>



<h1>Summer survey &amp; visits:</h1>



<p>Recess is a break during the Parliamentary calendar in which neither the House of Commons nor the House of Lords sits. It allows time for MPs to focus on their constituencies away from Westminster. The House of Commons rose this year on the 21<sup>st</sup> July and will return on the 5<sup>th</sup> of September, also the date in which we will learn the winner of the Conservative leadership contest and the next Prime Minister.</p>



<p>Over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;out and about in Amber Valley delivering my annual summer survey. The purpose of this survey is to get your views on some of the biggest issues facing our constituency and the nation. This helps inform my decisions on how best to represent you in Westminster, and which local issues my team and I should focus on in our area. If you see me out and about, please feel free to come and have a chat, even if it is not about politics. If you’d like to do the summer survey online, you can also&nbsp; complete it <a href="https://nigelmillsmp.com/residents-survey-2022/">here.</a></p>



<p>In addition to delivering surveys, I have also been using my time in recess so far to visit local farms and industry. On the 25<sup>th</sup> July I visited Crowfields Farm in Langley Mill where, among other things, we discussed food security, sustainable food production and the volatile markets created by the energy price spikes and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<h1>Other local news &#8211; <em>and don&#8217;t forget to vote for Shipley Country Park!</em></h1>



<p>Historic England has announced a grant of nearly £10,000 for MSDS Heritage to realise a project which will explore the old working-class communities and cottage industry that once existed within Holbrook. The project is called ‘Holbrook’s Hidden Heritage’ and will involve archaeologists working with local schools and volunteers to create workshops, events, web content, open days, and pop-up events.</p>



<p>Holbrook in 1845 contained 54 stocking-frame workshops, with 152 stocking frames operated by workers with materials supplied by the mills at Milford and Belper. Learning more about our past can inspire pride and a sense of community in the present, so I hope this project gets the attention it deserves.</p>



<p>In other local news, as some of you will have seen from my social media, Shipley County Park has been nominated for Fields in Trust UK’s Favourite Parks award 2022. Voting is now open to decide the nations favourite park and will close at noon on the 18th August. If a park finishes within the top 20% of votes, it will receive recognition as a ‘Local Favourite’. The four Home Nation winners will then be shortlisted before the UK’s favourite park is announced.</p>



<p>Shipley Country Park is an exceptionally valuable local space. And when local parks have acted as a sanctuary for so many over the past few years, now is our chance to celebrate the spaces where we could get outdoors, move, relax, and meet with loved ones.</p>



<p>Please show your support by voting online before Thursday 18th August: <a href="http://www.fieldsintrust.org/favourite-parks/nominations">www.fieldsintrust.org/favourite-parks/nominations</a></p>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

It’s fantastic to see Commonwealth Connections promoting collaboration and encouraging young people to make new connections with people from different backgrounds and different countries. </p>
<p>“The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 affect us all and it’s vital young people, as future leaders, understand why these are so important. By talking to people across the world with different perspectives of how climate change and sustainability is impacting people’s lives is how we show how global Britain can be a force for good.” </p>
<p>During the event, St Paul’s School for Girls was presented with a British Council foundation level <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/accreditation/international-school-award/about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International School Award</a> by the organisation’s Senior Schools Consultant, John Rolfe MBE. The award champions schools that have shown a commitment to embedding international awareness and understanding in their classrooms and curriculums. The £500k Commonwealth Connections project is co-funded by Birmingham 2022 and the British Council.  </p>
<p>The British Council is delivering the project with Birmingham Education Partnership (BEP) and the children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust (YST). BEP has nominated its flagship Birmingham Arts School to lead on delivery of the arts and culture strand of the project. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Semua game di bawah satu atap</strong></li>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
