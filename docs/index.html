<p>I am regularly contacted by constituents from across Aldridge-Brownhills who have been given unfair parking fines. That is why the Government believe that it is time to take action.</p>
<p>I am pleased that a new code of practice will be introduced and extended to private parking firms. This will mean that most fines will be capped at £50, with a statutory 50% discount for payment within 14 days, it will also entitle motorists to a ten-minute grace period before a fine can be issued.</p>
<p>I believe that these small measures will help to give greater protection to motorists.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span><span>The recent workshop held in Necton by Vattenfall (at which I opened the discussions and spoke) was a helpful step forwards in the process that is their Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone Community Benefit Fund.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>From day one, I have always been clear that IF Necton and other affected villages accommodate this Nationally Significant Infrastructure, Vattenfall must provide substantial compensation to them in the form of community benefits – and I welcomed the opportunity to reaffirm that belief to them at the workshop.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Having had time to receive feedback from many of those that attended the workshop, I am now writing to the Vattenfall team to highlight two key points again:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol><li><span><span><span><strong><span>Visual mitigation: </span></strong><span>The main reason I opposed Vattenfall’s substation proposals in Necton was due to the widespread concerns that insufficient visual mitigation was included in the plans. Those concerns persist to this date and have unsurprisingly been raised by members of the community again. I believe however that </span>visual mitigation should not be confused with the community benefit fund. Visual mitigation should instead be addressed in its own right. It seems wrong to me that the fund could be used to address something that should rightly be covered in Vattenfall’s plans, and in the construction stage should they get there.</span></span></span><br />
	 </li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>A stronger voice for Necton and the most affected communities: </span></strong><span>I have repeatedly stated to Vattenfall that those parishes most affected must have the “lions-share” of any community benefit fund. However, I also believe that those affected parishes should have the strongest voice too. The views of those communities must have considerable weight in determining the benefits they receive. I was concerned to see Vattenfall’s presentation that equal weight seems to be given to the views of people who are not suffering any detrimental impact from this infrastructure like students miles away in Norwich. This benefit fund should not be looked at ‘in the round’ of the county. Those most affected must be heard loud and clear.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol><p><span><span><span><span>Please be assured that, in addition to raising this with Vattenfall, I also intend to flag these issues with the Secretary of State and Energy Minister in my role as a constituency MP. I remain committed to working with the local communities to ensure they have a strong voice as this matter progresses – and I will continue to emphasise the need for greater consideration to be given to visual mitigation.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The US President is putting out a lot of information about Russian troops, weapons and naval deployments. He is telling us that an invasion of Ukraine may well be imminent. Russia denies an invasion but cannot credibly deny the deployment of a lot of military might. Mr Putin tells us these are Russian and Belarus forces jointly exercising on their own lands. The USA has a different view.</p>
<p>The USA speaking for NATO makes clear that NATO  forces would not respond to invasion by entering the fight in Ukraine, but NATO would clearly be on the side of the Ukrainian government and the large  majority of the people who would fight against a military takeover of their country. Some NATO members have supplied weapons to Ukraine and offered training to Ukrainian personnel. Presumably in the event of an invasion more such support would be supplied.</p>
<p>NATO&#8217;s main threat to Russia is its members  will impose wide ranging sanctions with a view to damaging the Russian economy. The idea is these would be tougher than the ones introduced after the annexation of Crimea . It is not clear they would extend to preventing Russia using western banking systems, nor has Germany made clear whether any of this extends to gas.</p>
<p>France and Germany hope for a  negotiated settlement of the issues surrounding the Russian presence in Luhansk and Donetsk. They wish to revive the Minsk 2 Agreement they helped broker in 2015 which aimed to secure Russian withdrawal from east Ukraine in return for substantial devolved power to  new elected governments in the two anti Kiev  provinces. The original Agreement failed because the local forces and Russia  wanted more devolution than Ukraine wished to provide, and Ukraine wanted a faster and more comprehensive Russian withdrawal than was on offer. Events in Crimea followed the expulsion of an elected Ukrainian President who wanted to follow a more pro Russian and less pro EU foreign policy.</p>
<p>The fate of East Ukraine is not however the only thing Russia is raising. Russia also wants assurances Ukraine will not pursue her wish to join NATO, and wants NATO to cut its forces deployed in its eastern member countries for self defence. The USA needs to handle the NATO discussions following consultation with allies, and France and Germany should continue the Minsk discussions following talks with the Ukraine government and the Eastern opponents of the Kiev line. President Biden has to erase again  his suggestion that a limited Russian incursion would not  be so bad, and stress the corrections his team have put out.</p>

<h1>Chaos in Westminster as crises multiply</h1>
<p>Whilst covid cases numbers continue to be very high, hospitalisations and deaths appear to have peaked and it has been possible to reduce and remove some restrictions. However there is continued disruption particularly to school education and the NHS. It is very wrong to think that covid is over.</p>

<p>But we do have other growing crises. Russian forces continue to mass on the Ukraine border but the UK is dragging its feet on imposing financial sanctions on Russia, and remains a destination for Russian dirty money and influence. The cost of living is rocketing, Ofcom has doubled the energy price cap and with people staring massive energy bills in the face the Government has come up with a complex buy now pay later policy whilst Labour is calling for a windfall tax on the huge profits being made by energy companies such as Shell and BP. We also have an NHS crisis, with record breaking waiting lists and backlog of unseen patients.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Afghanistan millions face starvation and terrible oppression.  Constituents are desperate to get their relatives out of the country</p>
<p>And Partygate rumbles on with the Metropolitan Police now investigating at least ten parties, some of which the Prime Minister himself attended. Whilst key staff resign or are sacked the Prime Minister insists on carrying on when his premiership is clearly not in the interest of the country.</p>
<h1>Backbench and Constituency Role</h1>
<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I launched two campaigns – Better Buses in Newcastle, and Celebrating Hadrian’s Wall in Newcastle’s West End.</li>
<li>Better buses scored an early success with real time integrated bus info soon to be available on Citymapper.</li>
<li>My Hadrian’s Wall Westminster Hall debate garnered a lot of interest and media coverage but we are still awaiting the detailed written response from the minister.</li>
<li>We also, finally, received a response from Newcastle City Council with regard to putting up notices asking for people not to feed the pigeons.</li>

<p><strong>Kenton School visit to Parliament on Engineering careers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I raised the near-crush experienced by Newcastle United fans at Elland Road on 22 January 2022 and obtained a commitment to investigate.</li>
<li>With the Ukraine in the news I raised the progress of justice for John Alder and Liam Sweeney victims of flight MH17.</li>
<li>I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding families of constituents in Afghanistan, the availability of tests for businesses, the war memorial in Eldon Square and the use of community car clubs. Newcastle City Council agreed to put up signs saying not to feed the pigeons, after much correspondence.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Shadow Ministerial and PES Role</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Government finally and belatedly published its much anticipated Levelling Up report. Maddy worked hard to provide initial analysis. It looks as if R&amp;D is actually the only new money and the commitment to increase R&amp;D outside London and the South East by 40% has no detail and no plan. In other areas such as transport and housing the commitments are vague or reannouncements.  Apparently by 2030 our bus services will be ‘significantly closer’ to London’s. Still not as good though.</li>
<li>We continue to work to clarify the Government research spending.</li>

<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<p>To follow up on previous emails about changes to the timetable in February, I wanted to confirm the plan.  We will be amending our timetables from Monday 28 February, following a period of significant staff absence due to Covid and a major blockade of engineering works on the Brighton mainline between 19-27 February.</p>
<p>While the picture is improving overall, and the direct impact of Covid on colleagues is reducing, its legacy continues to have an impact on our business and services.  One example is a backlog of driver training due to previous social distancing requirements where, for example, two people were not permitted to be in a train cab together.</p>
<p>So, in the short term, we have taken a prudent approach to adding services, with the aim of ensuring we can offer reliability, rather than having to cancel trains last minute and create large gaps in the service.  We want to thank customers for their patience and understanding throughout this period.</p>
<p>We are now starting to see more people return to rail, albeit in much lower numbers than before the pandemic, particularly as people continue to work from home some of the week. We will therefore be introducing a new timetable from Monday 28 February to ensure our services and resources are the best possible fit.  We are focusing on providing more capacity for commuters returning to the office. Our February timetable change includes more direct services to London Victoria and London Bridge, increases to peak services, especially in the early morning and in areas where there are no other public transport options.</p>
<p>In terms of what this means specifically for your constituency, Southern services will return to the timetable used in the Autumn of 2021 from the 21 February.  This means that the direct routes to London Victoria from Epsom via Hackbridge and Epsom Downs via West Croydon will resume, as will Tattenham Corner’s fast trains to London Bridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in the Autumn, something to be aware of is while the service from Epsom to London Bridge will resume, there will be a reduced frequency in the morning. Trains from Epsom to London Bridge will depart at 05:45, 07:16, 08:15 then every 30 minutes until 22:45. The reason being, as in September, the morning peak is the busiest point on the network and we will be seeking to spread our available crew resource as best we possibly can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individual journeys for the timetable of 28 February are due in journey planners this week and we will be increasing customer communications about the changes.  We advise customers to plan their journeys in advance and re-check before they travel, especially the weeks commencing 21 February and 28 February.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Senior Stakeholder Manager</p>

<p>On Monday, MPs voted through the annual pensions and benefits uprating order, designed to bring a whole range of social security benefits in line with inflation and the cost of living. However, this year it could actually mean a real-terms cut in the living standards for millions.</p>
<p>The increase voted through was 3.1 per cent, but it is based on last September's inflation figures. Inflation is currently at 5.4 per cent and the Bank of England are forecasting that inflation will reach 7.25% by April, leading to more expensive energy bills and pricier food in the shops.</p>
<p>Speaking during a debate in Parliament on the cost of living crisis, Tim said: "<em>Too little is being done to help those whose need is greatest. With inflation predicted for 7.25%, the 3.1% benefits uprating will lead to utter destitution.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"It is not just about physical hardship, but about the misery, shame and lack of dignity that go with it and the stress and mental health problems that go with abject poverty, when people cannot afford to feed their children, pay the rent or put fuel in their car to get to work - if they are lucky enough to have a car.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Kendal in my constituency is not a huge town by most people's standards, yet Linda Sutherland's wonderful team at King's Food Bank in Kendal provided 48,225 meals last year, which was 50% more than in 2020.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"The massive demand for services from people in desperate need tells us that we are doing something seriously wrong as a country."</em>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee began a new inquiry into the scrutiny of international treaties and other international agreements in the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. The first session was really an introduction, International Treaties 101 if you like, to set the context of the inquiry and to ensure a grounding in understanding of the issues involved in international treaty building. We heard from former legal advisers to the House of Lords and other parliamentary organisations as well as academic staff from UK universities. As the UK seeks to build its relations with other states outside of the EU, this will be a really important aspect of the Committee’s work, ensuring that the treaties that are signed work for the UK uphold our traditions of promoting democratic and transparent values in our public and political life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to lead Labour’s response to the Government’s White Paper on integration in the NHS. This is essentially the Government undoing the poor reforms of the Lansley Act – the Health and Social Care Act 2012. We know that reversing the Lansley Act and implementing a health and social care system fit for 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century Britain will be difficult, but it is unclear how the ideas in this White Paper fit in with the Health and Care Bill currently in the House of Lords. Like a house made of crepe paper, this gossamer-thin White Paper collapses with the faintest breeze of scrutiny. Let us be clear: it is not a plan, nor is it even a starting strategy. It is just a series of woolly claims about how things could be better, unsupported by any evidence or analysis of the resources, organisational and funding flow changes that will obviously be necessary. It could have been written at any time over the past 30 years. It contains little that is new and nothing to illustrate new thinking or new attitudes. It relies on the bogus assumption that because something may work for a while on a small scale, it will obviously work everywhere. It is not any kind of plan for integrated care that people will recognise; these are just aspirations about integrated systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health and social care in the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century goes beyond GP surgeries, care homes, and hospitals and must be considered across other sectors. I was pleased to speak at an event for the East of England Regional Roadshow this week on the topic of transport, benefits and social care with Vicky Foxcroft, the Shadow Minister for Disabled People and Tan Dhesi, the Shadow Minister for Transport. We have to consider how we ensure our society is inclusive for everyone and how we enable people to live independent lives while living with a physical or mental disability. We do not want a society where people with any kind of disability are having to live isolated in their homes and whose only interaction with people is through their carers. A disability simply means that there are certain obstacles to living a normal life that other people do not have; but crucially, it does not mean that those obstacles cannot be overcome and that someone living with a disability is not able to participate fully in society. We want to build the sort of society where that is a given and is considered across sectors in all policy-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded to a debate in Westminster Hall this week on behalf of the Labour Party on access to NHS dentistry in the UK. While the Covid pandemic has clearly had a huge impact on waiting times and access to care, the Care Quality Commission highlights that problems with access predate the pandemic quite significantly. The Government’s plans, that include paying dentists to work overtime in the early morning or at weekends, clearly underestimate the scale of the problem. If Covid is not the main cause for lack of access, there is a problem with the underlying assumptions about the requirements of NHS dentistry. Those are the assumptions the Government needs to tackle, and pushing dentists to work longer hours is not a safe way of solving the problems we’re seeing. </span></p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has called on the Government to adopt Labour’s plan to create over 20,000 new apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Gwynne’s intervention, which comes during National Apprenticeships Week, aims to counter the downward trend in training opportunities under the Conservative Government. In Denton and Reddish, apprenticeship starts have declined by over 45% since 2010.</p>
<p>To reverse this, Labour is calling on the Government to introduce a wage subsidy, which would be funded from underspent funding in the apprenticeships levy – a charge large employers have to pay to government.</p>
<p>Backed by the Association of Employers and Learning Providers (AELP), Labour’s plan could have created 100,000 new apprenticeships for 16-24 year olds across England this year.</p>
<p>National Apprenticeships Week runs until the 13<sup>th</sup> of February, and recognises the enormous contribution made by apprentices and their employers.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m really pleased to be backing National Apprenticeship Week. Apprentices make such a huge contribution to our economy and wider society, and it’s only right that we recognise that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the Government has really dropped the ball on apprenticeships, and young people in Denton and Reddish are paying the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government must adopt Labour’s wage subsidy policy as a matter of urgency. It’s the only way that we can boost opportunities and thrive as we continue to recover from the pandemic&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Shadow Minister for Further Education and Skills, Toby Perkins MP, added:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Conservatives have overseen a decade of decline in apprenticeships, failing to secure the skills and training opportunities our country needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on creating new opportunities for young people and tackling the skills shortages across key sectors of the UK economy, this government is distracted by scandals at the heart of Downing Street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ministers should adopt Labour’s plan to create thousands of new apprenticeships this year, securing the opportunities young people need to gain productive skills and support our economy to prosper.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After months of constant contact with the Scottish Government and CalMac regarding the network, Mr MacNeil is writing to the new Transport Minister, Jenny Gilruth MSP, to stress once again the need for prompt action starting with Transport Scotland doing an urgent short-sharp assessment on the current situation which would need to be done within a month maximum. Mr MacNeil is backing calls by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and others for action.</p>



<p>The current disruption to the lifeline network is due to 3 vessels being in dry dock and the critical MV Hebrides being out of action with engine trouble, meaning the islands network is, an important, 4 vessels short.</p>



<p>Commenting Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP Angus MacNeil said:</p>



<p>“I am writing to Transport Scotland to do a short-sharp assessment of the ferry problems and needs as identified by many people today including Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. We need action to bring about change in the Hebridean ferries.</p>



<p>“At the moment there has been a construction delay, as we know, at the Fergusons yard in Greenock. We need more ferries, as has been identified by the Comhairle and others. A logical consequence of what Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is calling for, is that enquiries must be made with shipyards in Poland and Germany that have built CalMac ferries in the past.</p>



<p>“The Pentalina meantime would look like a stop gap if it is fully seaworthy and there are no problems with it.</p>



<p>“Another obvious issue to be addressed is that the CalMac Board has to have islanders on it and I would suggest that the Council Leader and Transport Chairman be entrusted with these responsibilities. We wouldn’t have other bodies in Scotland without people resident in Scotland on them. To have CalMac ferries serving the island and not have anyone living on the islands on the CalMac Board is a clear and glaring problem!&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous Transport Minister was obviously wrong in his decision and hopefully the current Transport Minister will bring about change, then we might not have 4 ferries out of action at the same time.</p>



<p>“But this is also a time to remind Comhairle nan Eilean Siar that while they demand action on transport from other bodies they must live up to their own responsibilities and reinstate the inter-island flights they chose to cut. That was the greatest piece of vandalism to island transportation in decades and ironically placed extra burdens on ferries, and it was done by the Comhairle.&nbsp; The Comhairle pocketed that transportation money, without a thought or care for islanders, especially those needing hospital appointments.&nbsp; If they lived up to their responsibilities it would add greater weight to their worthy call today.”</p>

<p>As the Downing Street saga over the Prime Minister&#8217;s possible resignation continues, the real drama is the cost of living crisis.</p>



<p>Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for a second time, as fears grow over galloping inflation.</p>



<p>Inflation is heading for 7% and new interest rates will mean an extra £25 per month on a tracker mortgage while loans and credit purchases will also be more expensive.</p>



<p>Experts predict a further rise next month.</p>



<p>Even if this doesn&#8217;t affect you immediately, no one can have failed to notice increases in the cost of things like food, childcare and petrol.</p>



<p>If all that isn&#8217;t bad enough, we&#8217;re about to be hit with a massive rise in energy bills just as we approach the coldest part of winter.</p>



<p>Ofgem, charged with protecting consumers, has decided to raise the price cap, making bills more expensive.</p>



<p>The average family will now need to find another £700 per year for gas and electric.</p>



<p>The Chancellor says he expects bills to increase further in the autumn.</p>



<p>It might make sense if oil and gas companies were having a really hard time but Shell have just announced profits for 2021 of £14.2 billion and BP £9.4 billion, their biggest for eight years.</p>



<p>Shareholders and company executives must be rubbing their hands with glee.</p>



<p>Labour has suggested the Chancellor cut VAT on domestic fuel, which Boris Johnson promised if we left the EU, and tax the oil and gas profits, to reduce our bills.</p>



<p>Instead, the Chancellor has decided to borrow money for the energy companies and for them to then loan it to us.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure you need to be an economist to smell a rat.</p>



<p>Shareholders get a whopping dividend while we end up paying more for our gas and electric as well as funding the Chancellor&#8217;s cunning plan to plunge us all into debt.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like he&#8217;s become Wonga Man overnight.</p>



<p>I know his mind might be on a vacancy at No 10 but our Chancellor should be focussed on the cost-of-living crisis and dealing with these energy companies.</p>



<p>We shouldn&#8217;t be subsidising them.</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p>Last week saw two publications from the UK Government, both of them were unedifying and deeply unsatisfactory in their own ways.</p>
<p>The Sue Gray update, which was supposed to be a complete, unredacted report of the rule-breaking parties at number 10 Downing Street, rightly got a lot of attention in the press.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from many of you, sharing your anger at the lack of respect and humility shown by the Prime Minister and his Government. I am sure it won&#8217;t surprise you that I share your frustration at the situation, and I wish I could do more than respond with words of agreement. Rest assured, in Parliament, I will continue to make your views on the subject heard.</p>
<p>The Sue Gray update was a heavily censored summary but made it clear that there had been &#8216;Serious failures of leadership&#8221; at Number ten. The Prime Minister cannot escape this verdict; he is the leader at No. 10. No amount of cover-up and no matter how high the mountain of lies, the fact is that he is unfit to hold office. He said he was &#8220;furious&#8221; with staff when the story first broke and, remember, gratefully accepted the resignation of his Press Secretary, Allegra Stratton, before Christmas. Yet, he thinks he can carry on regardless.</p>
<p>The second report published last week was the &#8216;Benefits of Brexit&#8217; report. It was published alongside the Sue Gray report &#8211; obviously, a failed attempt to divert the news cycle. Frustratingly, it only got minimal coverage, and there was little to no opportunity to challenge the Government on their supposed &#8216;advantages of Brexit included in the report. (You can watch my full response <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbYQGRBVD3Y&amp;ab_channel=DrewHendry">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The report is over 100 pages yet fails to acknowledge the catastrophic impacts of Brexit on businesses and households. It offers no solutions or answers. The report lists&#8217; cheaper holidays in the EU&#8217; as a flagship Brexit achievement. Hundreds of thousands of families are struggling to find the money to pay for fuel to drive to work because of the tory costs of living crisis &#8211; never mind holiday abroad.</p>
<p>The report goes on to celebrate the fact that Brexit is &#8216;Saving UK consumers money by allowing them to do more of their shopping duty-free.&#8217; Again, talking up high-end shopping in airports when more and more folk can&#8217;t even afford to do their weekly food shop shows just how out of touch this UK Government are. Where&#8217;s the part of the report that acknowledges Brexit&#8217;s impact on prices; where&#8217;s the solution from this Government?</p>
<p>Of course, there was enough space in the report for an entire section dedicated to  &#8216;Global Britain&#8217;. Yet, it is hard to remember a time when the UK&#8217;s reputation was so much in tatters.</p>
<p>These two documents sum up Westminster &#8211; and why we now need to make our own decisions, here, in Scotland.</p>
<p>I will keep highlighting the severe impact of the cost of living crisis and the energy price hike on your families. I also want to remind you all that if there is anything you think I may be able to help your family with, please get in touch with my office. While I cannot promise to fix the problem, my team and I will do all we can to help or point you in the right direction. Please don&#8217;t suffer alone – support is out there.</p>

Yet millions of people in the UK are struggling to feed themselves and put food on the table. Now, hard-working families are bracing themselves for the biggest drop in living standards in thirty years with petrol, food and energy bills are all skyrocketing. People have been left to choose between putting food in the fridge or money on the meter and while working families deserve security, prosperity and respect, they aren’t getting it. And, this isn’t just because of Covid or global problems.  </p>
<p>“Despite having years to prepare for Brexit, the incompetent Conservatives have failed to make Brexit work that’s resulted in labour shortages and supply chain disruption causing increased prices for basic food items.  </p>
<p>“Even before the Covid19 crisis hit, it was estimated that over eight million people in the UK regularly had trouble putting food on the table, half a million people used foodbanks and one million people lived in food deserts where it is impossible for people to buy healthy food. Trussel Trust figures show that the number of children eligible for free school meals has increased in Birmingham by 30% since 2016. But this unsustainable rate is entirely unsurprising when we have a government that have cut Universal Credit to 6 million families, increased National Insurance Contributions and have failed to tackle rising energy bills.  </p>
<p>“Tackling hunger was a founding cause for the co-operative movement, and for me, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, this remains as vital today as it did then. That’s why I am proud to stand alongside my Labour colleagues in calling for the Government to set out a national strategy for food including how it intends to ensure access to high quality, sustainable, affordable food for all and meet the Sustainable Development Goals to end hunger by 2030.” </p>

<p>Last week there was a debate in Parliament on fraud and Government waste. The Government has an appalling record on both, repeatedly showing a lack of respect for taxpayer’s money.</p>
<p>The Chancellor himself has recently written off £4.3 billion in fraud from the coronavirus business loan scheme and two weeks ago, the Government’s own anti-fraud Minister resigned in protest, saying the Treasury “appear to have no knowledge or little interest in the consequences of fraud to our economy or our society”.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t have to pay for a Tory tax rise which adds to the cost of living crisis when billions are being leaked to fraud or wasted on government mistakes.</p>
<p>In the debate Labour called on the Government to allow the National Crime Agency to investigate these astronomical levels of fraud, and for them to come back with an update on the amount of taxpayer’s funds they’ve clawed back from criminals by the end of the March. You can read more about this <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-02-01/debates/151F8D55-94D6-408A-88CC-970D350C6F9D/TacklingFraudAndPreventingGovernmentWaste#contribution-535C7631-80EF-49ED-9F5D-2CDE8F13B297">here</a></p>
<p>Labour in Government will set up an independent Office for Value for Money to scrutinise government spending and ensure taxpayers’ cash is being spent well.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Date: February 4, 2022</u></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Edition number: 34 </u></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Introduction:</u></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We have given more than 800,000 doses and continue to vaccinate seven days a week.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Full details of where you can get the dose you need are below, along with information on other developments.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><u>Latest news</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Statement from our Executive Director of Public Health, Keith Reid, following an issue at the Bay Mass Vaccination Centre last weekend.</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“I wish to apologise to those young people who were turned away from the vaccination centre at the weekend after responding to an invitation for a second dose.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“This shouldn’t have happened and I am sorry for the upset and upheaval this will have caused you and your families. I also recognise that you now have to attend again to get the vaccination and I hope that your experience on your recent visit has not put you off getting a second dose of vaccine.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“I have asked for an investigation to establish why this occurred so we can prevent it happening again.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“We understand that at least 30 young people were turned away in error over the Saturday and Sunday and we are really sorry about this. The investigation will look in detail at why this happened and the exact numbers who were affected. But at this stage it does not appear that the invitations were issued too early.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Vaccination for those with allergies</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">If you have an allergy or allergies, we understand you will need good quality information on how your body might react to vaccination before deciding to go ahead.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">If you do have questions or concerns you can speak to one of our clinicians by contacting our booking line on <span dir="ltr">01792 200492</span> or <span dir="ltr">01639 862323</span> before attending for vaccination.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">After speaking to you, the clinical lead may refer you to the allergy clinic where there is the potential option of having the vaccine in a specialised clinic if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We have also pulled together some vaccination facts that may help:</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">·         The Covid vaccines are safe for those with allergies (including anaphylaxis) to wasp, bee or other insect stings and allergies to any food or drink.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         The current vaccines do not contain any traces of nuts, gluten, egg, or soy.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         The current vaccines do not contain latex and are therefore suitable for those with an allergy to latex.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         All UK approved Covid vaccines do not contain penicillin or any other antibiotics. If you are allergic to penicillin or another antibiotic, you can still receive the vaccines.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         All immunisers are trained and will assess suitability for vaccination when they go through the eligibility questions prior to vaccination. If there is any concern they will refer to our allergy service for advice.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">·         If vaccination goes ahead the immuniser might request you wait for longer post vaccination – up to 30 minutes.<b> </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Getting the vaccine</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">You can get whatever dose you need at drop-in sessions or by booking online.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">In addition, we continue to invite those who become eligible.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Drop-in sessions are available at the Bay MVC, our containers (local vaccination centres) at the Guildhall in Swansea, Pontardawe Leisure Centre and in a number of community pharmacies.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span dir="ltr">From Wednesday, February 16</span><sup><span dir="ltr">th</span></sup>, we will also have a container outside Croeserw Community Hub.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/PqoOCL73oFzAxl3CBXxla?domain=sbuhb.nhs.wales/">Please go to our website for more details on vaccination sessions and the online booking link.</a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Important information:</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraph">·         Anyone 18 or over or under 18 and in an at-risk category who has had a positive Covid test result must wait until 28 days have passed following the positive result before having a vaccination.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">·         Anyone aged 12 to 17 who is not at risk and has had a positive Covid test result must wait until 12 weeks have passed following the positive result before having a vaccination.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         Please note, the vaccination appointment system generates appointments based on the date of the previous dose and is not able to take a positive Covid test result into account. So you may get an invitation to attend before the 28 day or 12-week waiting period is up. Please only attend once the appropriate period has passed post the positive test result.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·         There does not need to be any gap between a HPV vaccine and Covid vaccine, no matter which comes first.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">·         There must be a gap of 13 weeks or more between a 2nd or 3rd primary dose and a booster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Trial for Covid treatment</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Have you just tested positive for Covid-19? Would you like to join a new UK-wide trial for effective early treatments?</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This trial is available for people who are at wider risk of serious illness from Covid-19 either because:</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">•        They are over the age of 50, or</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">•        They are aged 18 to 49 with underlying health conditions. (Many will already qualify for free annual flu jabs.)</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To take part people need to fall into one of the at-risk groups, have tested positive for Covid-19 by either a PCR or LFT test, and have symptoms.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The PANORAMIC trial involves a course of oral tablets. These tablets are already used to treat some people who are ill enough with Covid-19 to be in hospital.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The trial is now looking at how effective the treatment is for people who are still at home who test positive for Covid-19, and who have symptoms.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It is a UK-wide study and anyone who is in the at-risk categories can apply to take part, whether they have been vaccinated or not.  More details, including a link to apply online, are available on the PANORAMIC website <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Yyf4CNL3qigAKw6fj9Wln?domain=panoramictrial.org">www.panoramictrial.org</a>  Or, ring <span dir="ltr">08081 560017</span> (calls are free.)</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Once accepted onto the trial, the tablets are posted to you straight away as they should be taken within five days. You will be asked to answer follow up questions online or by telephone, but no face-to-face visits are needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Afghan interpreter’s move to Swansea translates into new NHS career</b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Having flown out of Afghanistan, fearing for his life as the Taliban stormed Kabul, Mohamed Ferooz Noori is now helping save lives by working with Swansea Bay’s vaccination programme.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The father of two was relocated to the UK following the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last August.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">He had been working as a translator alongside the British military, and when he arrived in the UK was originally sent to Cardiff before moving to Swansea. He now works as a call handler in Bay Mass Vaccination Centre.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">Swansea Bay’s vaccination team has undergone an amicable parting of the ways with The Orangery at Margam.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">After delivering more than 150,000 Covid vaccinations, over the course of the past year, at the picturesque wedding venue in the grounds of Margam Park, the team is set to move to a new venue in Aberafan Shopping Centre.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The change of venue will allow The Orangery to revert to its former use as a sought-after location for happy couples to celebrate tying the knot.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">People suffering with long Covid symptoms are benefiting from getting out in the great outdoors as part of their ongoing recovery.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">A new walking group sees those taking part exercising at their own pace as they are accompanied along the route by a GP and a physiotherapy assistant practitioner.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Patients who have been referred to the Long Covid Rehabilitation Service, which runs from the Bay Field Hospital, are invited to take part in the weekly walks as an extension of the support available to them.</p>

              <h3>Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s Levelling Up White Paper and the boost it will bring to Boston &amp; Skegness by increasing wages, improving living standards, and regenerating local communities across the country.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This is the next step on the Conservative Government’s mission to unite and level up Britain, with radical new policies announced across the board – including a devolution revolution, London-style transport systems and 5G across the country, as well as elimination of innumeracy and illiteracy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is creating a better quality of life for people in every part of the UK – so everyone can access the opportunities they need to succeed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Levelling Up White Paper unveiled by the Levelling Up Secretary, Michael Gove, on 2 February 2022, and the benefits it will bring to Boston &amp; Skegness. The document sets out the Government’s plan to transform the UK by spreading opportunity and prosperity to every community in every region of the country.</p>
<p>At the heart of this new way of making and implementing policy will be 12 bold national missions – all quantifiable and to be achieved by 2030. These missions will be cross-government, cross-society efforts.</p>
<p>By 2030, the missions set out by the Conservative Government will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rest of the country’s local public transport systems becoming much closer to London standards,</li>
<li>The large majority of the country gain access to 5G broadband,</li>
<li>90 per cent of primary children achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and maths – with the government’s education efforts focussed on the most disadvantaged parts of the country,</li>
<li>55 Education Investment Areas established in parts of the country with weakest school outcomes,</li>
<li>The mobilisation of £16 billion of local government pension schemes to turbocharge local investment,</li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands more people completing high quality skills training every year,</li>
<li>Disparities in healthy life expectancy narrowed,</li>
<li>The number of poor-quality rented homes halved,</li>
<li>Kings Cross style regeneration deals across 20 places in England,</li>
<li>The most run-down town centres and communities across the country rejuvenated,</li>
<li>£39 million to widen access to parks – particularly in areas with the lowest access to green space,</li>
<li>A significant decrease in serious crime in the most blighted areas,</li>
<li>Every part of England getting a devolution deal if they wish to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This Conservative Government is committed to levelling up the whole of the UK – which means increasing wages, living standards, and quality of life for people in Boston &amp; Skegness too.</p>
<p>“That is why I am delighted to welcome the Levelling Up White Paper, which lays out the Government’s plan to create jobs, spread opportunity and empower communities across the UK, including in Boston &amp; Skegness.</p>
<p>“Through this plan, which builds on work over the last two years, this Conservative Government is delivering on its commitments to the British people by levelling up across the whole of the country.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“From day one, the defining mission of this government has been to level up this country, to break the link between geography and destiny so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities.</p>
<p>“The challenges we face have been embedded over generations and cannot be dug out overnight, but this White Paper is the next crucial step.</p>
<p>“It is a vision for the future that will see public spending on R&amp;D increased in every part of the country; transport connectivity improving; faster broadband in every community; life expectancies rising; violent crime falling; schools improving; and private sector investment being unleashed.</p>
<p>“It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The United Kingdom is an unparalleled success story. We have one of the world’s biggest and most dynamic economies. Ours is the world’s most spoken language. We have produced more Nobel Prize winners than any country other than America.</p>
<p>“But not everyone shares equally in the UK’s success. For decades, too many communities have been overlooked and undervalued. As some areas have flourished, others have been left in a cycle of decline. The UK has been like a jet firing on only one engine.</p>
<p>“Levelling Up and this White Paper is about ending this historic injustice and calling time on the postcode lottery.</p>
<p>“This will not be an easy task, and it won’t happen overnight, but our 12 new national levelling up missions will drive real change in towns and cities across the UK, so that where you live will no longer determine how far you can go.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On 2 February 2022, we published our Levelling Up White Paper, which sets out our plan to spread opportunity and reduce geographical inequality across the UK.</strong> The paper sets out 12 missions by which to measure our success at levelling up and a range of policies to achieve this ambition (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1052064/Levelling_Up_White_Paper_HR.pdf">DLUHC, Levelling Up White Paper, 2 February 2022</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our Conservative record on levelling up the UK:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing overall skills spending by £3.8 billion over this Parliament, turbocharging productivity, wages and prospects for all. This real terms increase of 26 per cent will fund more hours learning for 16-19 year olds, expanding T Levels, more traineeships, funding the Lifetime Skills Guarantee, upgrading our further education college estate, quadrupling the number of places on our skills bootcamps, and spending record sums on apprenticeships (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Investing an additional £4.7 billion per year on schools funding, investing in our children. We are committing another £4.7 billion per year by 2024 to lift real terms per pupil spending to historic 2010 levels – a cash uplift of over £1,500 per pupil (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Increasing spending on healthcare by £44 billion over the course of this Parliament, improving health outcomes across our country. Resource spending on health services will increase to over £177 billion and we will deliver at least 100 Community Diagnostic Centres and 40 new hospitals (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Investing £11.5 billion through our Affordable Homes Programme, improving access to high quality affordable housing. Our Affordable Homes Programme will deliver up to 180,000 homes by 2028-9, with 65 per cent of the funding for delivery of homes outside London (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Establishing a £500 million Beeching Reversal Fund, reconnecting towns and villages across England. The Fund will restore rail lines in the north of England and Midlands, which were cut off from the rest of the network during the 1960s (<a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf">Conservative Party, Manifesto 2019, 24 November 2019</a>).</li>
<li>Channelling investment in green industry across the UK, creating skilled and well-paid jobs. The £140 million Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support scheme and £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Fund will support innovative hydrogen projects across the UK. Our £160 million investment in offshore wind power hubs will create and safeguard at least 2,500 jobs in Teesside, Humberside and the North-East, ultimately enabling the sector to support up to 60,000 jobs by 2030 (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Improving local and civic infrastructure with our £4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund. We have announced the first £1.7 billion of allocations, which will fund over 100 projects to improve local infrastructure, including a new medical training facility in Bolton, the regeneration of Doncaster Town Centre, and upgrades to coastal attractions in Southend-on-Sea, among others (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Making £3.6 billion available for towns to kickstart local projects, driving growth and improving the environment in 101 towns. The Towns Fund will invest in transport, technology, skills, and culture in towns across the country (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Investing £830 million into 72 high streets and town centres, restoring high streets to their former glory. Our Future High Streets Fund is helping communities redevelop high streets, improve transport and access to town centres, and turn empty retail units into homes and workspace (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028814/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>
<li>Providing the largest funding settlement to the devolved administrations since devolution in 1998 – making sure everyone across the UK can access high-quality public services. This Budget increases Scottish Government funding by an average of £4.6 billion per year, Welsh Government funding by £2.5 billion per year, and £1.6 billion per year for the Northern Ireland Executive (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043689/Budget_AB2021_Web_Accessible.pdf">HM Treasury, Autumn Budget and Spending Review, 27 October 2021</a>).</li>

<p>Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&#8217;s long overdue &#8220;Levelling Up&#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. </p>



<p>Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.</p>



<p>“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.</p>



<p>“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.</p>



<p>“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.</p>



<p>“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.</p>



<p>“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.</p>



<p>“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.</p>



<p>“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”</p>

<p>My comments on the Prime Minister&#8217;s response to the partial Sue Gray report:</p>



<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister needs to go. This isn’t about wine, cheese or cake. It’s about trust and leadership. Under this Prime Minister, we have had a government focussed on covering up events over the pandemic. But the reality is there has been a culture of drinking and partying in Number 10 and it shows a complete lack of care for the hardships that have been faced by the public through this time of national crisis. If the Prime Minister can’t be trusted to tell the truth about this, he cannot be trusted to run the country. He’s a lame duck Prime Minister, and if his MPs continue to prop him up it’s the country that will suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke in a Westminster Hall debate on the need for the UK Government to urgently do more to enable global access to vaccines for COVID-19. A global response is essential. </p>

<p><strong>Full text of my speech:</strong></p>



<p>I want to declare an interest I&#8217;m chair of the all party group on vaccinations for all. And vice-chair of the Coronavirus all party group, where we&#8217;ve been taking evidence every fortnight since July, 2020, including hearing from health ministers across Sub-Saharan Africa and other places that emphasize what we&#8217;ve been hearing today, the difficulties they have in access, and also the poor quality of supply that they&#8217;re actually getting. It is certainly true that all of us have gained from the researchers who&#8217;ve developed new vaccines and I too pay tribute to the staff of the four NHS across the UK, for the speed and skill with which they have delivered it.</p>



<p>But we have vaccinated almost 80% of adults with a third or booster shot, when the access to even one shot in low-income countries is well below 10%. And that simply highlights what we mean by, in adequate access and inequity across the globe.</p>



<p>High-income countries have literally hoovered up the vaccines as they were developed over the last year. And that&#8217;s indefensible. It&#8217;s very reminiscent of aids. When people in Africa who were suffering from HIV or aids couldn&#8217;t access the treatments that were available in the richer countries.</p>



<p>The spring before 2020, I keep forgetting it&#8217;s a new year. We heard lots of warm words about a global response, to a global crisis. But that is simply not what we&#8217;ve seen. We have seen that COVAX was established and the UK government gave over 500 million pounds to it. It didn&#8217;t give any vaccines until quite late last year.</p>



<p>And what was meant to happen with COVAX is that they would procure directly from companies &#8211; that never happened. And therefore COVAX has ended up completely dependent on getting donated doses from countries that were wealthy and simply did advanced procurements. And that&#8217;s the reason COVAX has delivered less than half of the 2 billion doses it was aspiring to deliver last year.</p>



<p>The UK government promised a hundred million doses in June 2021 at the G7 -80 million to COVAX, 20 million bilaterally. There&#8217;s been less than a quarter of that, that has actually been delivered to COVAX. We are at the end of 2021, the hundred million is meant to be delivered by this coming June, which means 9.1 million a month to COVAX, a total of 11 and a half million if you include any bilateral donations. So the UK needs to radically step up donations of doses. And donations of doses are the acute response. Because that can be done in the short term. The UK has enough excess that it could carry out its third and indeed for many vulnerable patients, fourth doses, as I&#8217;ve had myself as an immunocompromised person.</p>



<p>And still accelerate the donation of doses to more than meet its target by June.</p>



<p>Marker</p>



<p>The problem is wealthy countries think they can protect their populations purely by vaccinating their own population. And Omicron shows that simply isn&#8217;t true. When you have large parts of the world, particularly in the global south with low access to vaccines, you will generate high spread. You will generate therefore more mutations, and eventually there will be new variants. And some of those variants may be as infectious as Omicron, may be as transmissible, may be as good at at escaping either natural immunity or previous vaccination. They may turn out to be much more severe. This fairy story that inevitably a virus is committed to becoming milder is something that we are not in a position to count on.</p>



<p>So we still right now, two years into this crisis need a global response. And I therefore would call on the government the need to accelerate the donations, using the excess that we have. But these do need to be predictable. They need to be in collaboration with the low-income countries that are receiving them and they need to have a decent shelf life.</p>



<p>We heard of ministers having to visit the ports every day in case something had arrived. Having to keep stopping their own programs because suddenly they get a delivery that&#8217;s got a few weeks left on it. So that is disrespectful to countries that do not have the health infrastructure that we have across the UK.</p>



<p>It is critical to include consumables like syringes, needles. It&#8217;s also important to try and support the wider COVID-19 responses. If you look at the WHO data, you will notice the incredibly low levels of COVID supposedly in Africa. Africa does not have low levels. They have low levels of access to tests, and therefore the cases are not being registered. And we shouldn&#8217;t be using these doses as part of the already reduced ODA budget and certainly not charging them as more than the UK government has paid for them.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the short term approach, but the medium term approach is to massively increase global production. And the problem is the TRIPSwaiver has been being discussed basically for over a year.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d be in a totally different position if that had been moved on at the beginning.</p>



<p>The UK is one of a dwindling number of countries, which is blocking it -over 130 countries now support it. And it is important to recognize that most of the leading COVID-19 vaccines have indeed been developed with public funding, either from university settings, which are largely publicly funded or through the huge injections by the UK government, the US government, the EU governments and others.</p>



<p>It is important when we touched on polio, to think about the fact that Salt didn&#8217;t patent his vaccine, Alexander Fleming didn&#8217;t patent penicillin, Röntgen didn&#8217;t patent x-rays because they saw them as part of the global good.</p>



<p>As well as getting rid of the blockage of intellectual property rights and patents,</p>



<p>it&#8217;s important that there is proper sharing of data and technology transfer. But MSF have identified a hundred companies across Africa, Asia and Latin America, which are certified by the EMA, by the FDA or the WHO on good manufacturing practice. So to imply that it isn&#8217;t possible to produce vaccines to high quality in the global south is frankly insulting.</p>



<p>And messenger RNA vaccines hold a whole hope in the future for many neglected, tropical diseases, such as TB, such as malaria and others because of the technology. So by sharing that technology, now, it isn&#8217;t just about dealing with COVID-19. It actually opens up the ability to tackle the scourges of infectious diseases that many countries face.</p>



<p>The other thing is that the UK should be increasing production, to become a net exporter instead of importer. And therefore it is absolutely inexplicable why the UK government pooled funding from the Valneva production site in Livingston, when the trial data was about to be published. That was successful.</p>



<p>And as has been mentioned, because it&#8217;s a very traditional whole virus approach. There may be people who have been unwilling to take the messenger RNA vaccines, who would be willing to receive the Valneva vaccine. Because it&#8217;s whole virus, it may, and this has not yet been trialed, also provide a broader reaction</p>



<p>that may therefore remain viable, even when other variants arrive. What we&#8217;ve seen is that Omicron in comparison to Delta, which had four mutations on the spike protein Omicron has 32, it&#8217;s a totally different shape. And therefore, sadly, the AstraZeneca vaccine simply the key no longer fits the lock.</p>



<p>Pfizer does. But it wanes. We need to have broader vaccines so that we might be a bit more resistant to, to variance in the future.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important for the government to maintain the support for routine vaccination. And that means honoring the replenishment commitments to Gavi because routine vaccinations have suffered due to the disruption of the pandemic.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s important that UK has always been a leading funder of vaccination and they mustn&#8217;t now pool back. But also to think about future pandemics, the replenishment of Sepi, the epidemic preparedness initiative is coming up this year. The UK needs to commit to that. We are all talking about humanitarian and the moral need to support people in poor countries to have the access we&#8217;ve had..</p>



<p>But on top of the lives lost and the huge multi-trillion economic hit to the world, it is important that we recognize that this was a global challenge. The international community so far has failed. It doesn&#8217;t hold great hope for that other challenge of climate crisis if we can&#8217;t get our act together now in facing this.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>

<p>The Centres will provide a full range of scans and tests to patients to catch illnesses at the earliest signs – increasing NHS capacity and saving lives as the NHS aims to work through the historic elective backlog caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Local MP Grant Shapps has welcomed the announcement that the QEII centre in Welwyn Garden City has been selected as one of 40 sites across England for a new Community Diagnostic Centre to be built, with an initial investment of £2.85 million awarded by the Department for Health &amp; Social Care.</p>
<p>The centre will provide services closer to home for people in Welwyn Hatfield to meet rising demand, as part of the Conservative Government’s plan to tackle the NHS backlog and catch health issues quickly.</p>
<p>The QEII’s new Community Diagnostic Centre will achieve earlier diagnoses for patients through easier, faster, and more direct access to the full range of scans and tests needed to understand patients’ symptoms – including breathlessness and cancer symptoms.</p>
<p>The centre will also help reduce the risk of Covid transmission and contribute to the NHS’ net zero efforts by reducing the number of patients journeys required in Welwyn Hatfield through providing multiple scans and tests in a single visit.</p>
<p>Also on the cards for the local health service is a £2.4 million investment to create three new procedure rooms, split between the QEII and Lister hospitals.</p>
<p>The rooms will provide extra capacity for minor procedures, freeing up valuable space in operation theatres- improving theatre productivity and supporting efforts to reduce waiting list.</p>
<p>Adam Sewell-Jones said: “It was great to meet Mr Shapps and to share our plans for services in the area, including investing in the New QEII Hospital and working hard to reduce waiting times.</p>
<p>“Work begins shortly on a new procedure room at the New QEII, which will allow for minor procedures to take place locally. This means we can more effectively use our main theatre space at Lister Hospital to treat people who are waiting for more serious operations.</p>
<p>“We are also ensuring better access to diagnostics at the New QEII, such as MRI, CT, X-rays and ultrasound – seven days a week, and with extended opening hours. This will help us to diagnose conditions more quickly.</p>
<p>“The urgent treatment centre at the New QEII is now closed overnight because there were very low numbers of people needing care in those hours. It remains open and well-used during the day and I urge people to continue to seek treatment there for minor injuries and illnesses.</p>
<p>“I’d like to thank the public for their support for our hardworking staff and the Trust while we continue to work through the effects of the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “We know that many people have not been coming forward for key tests throughout the pandemic, which has contributed to the backlog, and can result in worsening health outcomes.</p>
<p>“The new Community Diagnostic Centre will help deliver better services for people across Welwyn Hatfield. By allowing problems to be detected earlier, better treatment can be given to patients.</p>
<p>“Through investing in early diagnosis and increasing NHS capacity we will be able to treat serious illnesses sooner and save lives – levelling up health outcomes across the country. Alongside these new procedure rooms, things are looking positive for our local health services.”</p></div>

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients.

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

              <h3>Emma Lewell-Buck (South Shields)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>



<p>You can read my full speech <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-10-27/debates/2FE67ECE-5C5C-4910-876B-9610627E645A/SewagePollutionWhitburn">here.</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>.

<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

First of all, thank you to everyone who has sent such kind messages to me after last night’s result in Birmingham Northfield. Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
