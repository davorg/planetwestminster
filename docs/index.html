<p>I read the spin that Rishi Sunak is a grown up. The Establishment use that phrase to write off anyone they disagree with as not part of their grown up club. Their idea of a grown up is one who just does and says what they want them to.</p>
<p>So it was Grown ups who pushed the U.K. into the Exchange Rate mechanism . Those of us who warned it would lead to a boom/bust were told we were not grown ups. We were, however, right.</p>
<p>It was more Grown ups who told us between 2005 and 2007 that the huge multiples of debt and derivatives produced by the global banking system were fine as they had found  new ways of managing risk. The many of us who warned it would be inflationary were dismissed.</p>
<p>Once the grown ups accepted they had triggered a debt laden inflation they switched to blaming the banks, draining markets of cash and forcing some banks into bankruptcy. Again we few who said make the adjustment slower and manageable were dismissed.</p>
<p>In recent years the grown ups told us money did not matter. They said they could create billions of it and keep interest rates at zero with no inflation. Anyone who said the opposite was dismissed.</p>
<p>Now they recognise they do have an inflationary problem in the U.K. the so called grown ups want to create a needless recession to tackle the inflation. They do not see the big monetary tightening belatedly undertaken will bring inflation down next  year.</p>
<p>How much more damage do these grown ups want to do? Why are they addicted to boom/ bust policies. Why are they so bad at reading the cycle?</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Conservative Party MPs voted to oust Boris Johnson saying he couldn’t be trusted to be our Prime Minister anymore. On Monday night, at about 10pm, 342 of them voted to have confidence in the Prime Minister and his government. Yes, you read that right. Within two weeks of baying for him to leave they quickly regrouped to support him to save themselves from a General Election. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the Conservative Party has run out of ideas and the country has run out of faith in them. I voted no confidence in the Government because it is clear that whoever takes over from Boris Johnson does not have a mandate to govern and will be unable to solve the issues facing the country.</p>
<p>Indeed, the result of the Conservative Party MPs ballots shows they are divided from top to bottom. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak will now parade themselves in front of an estimated 200,000 Conservative Party members this summer. This vote will decide the Prime Minister for the entire country.</p>
<p>When we hear the policy ‘solutions’ – and I use that term in the loosest sense – from Sunak and Truss we hear of dogmatic answers to the wrong questions. Unfunded spending commitment and tax cuts will not solve inflation nor the growing national debt racked up by the Government in the past 12 years. Today we discovered that national debt interest repayments have now hit £19.4bn – that’s up over £10bn from last June. It’s clear that the Conservative contenders to be Prime Minister are not going to be responsible with taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p>This week the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee launched its new inquiry into non-executive directors with questions from experts. The session explored the activities, appointment process and accountability mechanisms for non-executives, hearing from experts who have carried out research in this area at the Institute for Government, University College London Constitution Unit and Commission for Smart Government.</p>
<p>Non-executives are appointed by Secretaries of State to sit on the boards of government departments and provide challenge on departmental performance and delivery. The Committee’s inquiry was launched in June to examine a lack of transparency around their activities, influence, and effectiveness in UK Government governance structures.</p>
<p>It was also Health Questions this week. I pressed minister on why the Government barely mentioned social care when responding to the Urgent Question on ambulance waiting times. The Government’s approach to healthcare is short-sighted as they fail to ever consider social care properly. If we don’t tackle the chronic understaffing in social care or the broken model it is based upon, we will not solve the NHS waiting times.</p>
<p>Parliament has now gone into Summer Recess. What that means is the Commons, the Committees and all the other aspects of legislative scrutiny will now go on pause until September when the schools return. However, work will continue in the office supporting constituents.</p>
<p>There will be no more weekly round-ups until September when Parliament returns, but please do keep in touch.</p>
<p>If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/07/22/weekly-round-up-22-july-2022/">Weekly Round-Up 22 July 2022</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p>On Monday lunchtime Jess Morden MP Newport East hosted the Westminster event to celebrate the Welsh Arts Review 10th Anniversary. It was very interesting to listen to authors read out their contributions to the recently published anthology “<a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/home-to-you-10-years-of-wales-arts-review/9781739851705?fbclid=IwAR24jrBd3a5D0RgvqfsEKol7XylJSmCIVLNtt3p64MSSRujDE31UqxGlf5E">Home to You:10 Years of Wales Arts Review</a>”.</p>
<p>For the last decade Wales Arts Review has sought to publish some of the best critical writing from Wales and about Wales. Tracing the cultural ties between Wales and the wider world. This latest publication asks what it means to be Welsh in a globalised digital culture and how Wales responds to international crisis and controversies. Gary Raymond, presenter of The Review Show on BBC Radio Wales, is the editor and he began the event by reading out his forward to this latest anthology.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to meet Chris Roberts from South Wales Police at the PCSO event to mark the 20th Anniversary of the creation of PCSOs, sponsored by Unison. PCSOs are the face of the local police force, out on the streets, talking to people, supporting officers, preventing crime, and building relationships with local residents. We have wonderful PCSOs in Neath and I really value the service that they give in our communities, day in day out.</p>
<p>The business in the chamber was the debate on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-07-11/debates/494EDB6D-EEC5-45D2-97F1-009F2398D942/Energy(OilAndGas)ProfitsLevyBill">Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Bill</a>. After many hours of debate, votes were taken on amendments, clauses, and new clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labour voted against that – Clause 2 which creates a new investment allowance that producers have 91p in tax relief for every £1 they invest, which would see billions in windfall tax revenue going straight back to firms making mega profits – stand part of the Bill and lost by ayes 284 to noes 202.</li>
<li>Labour New Clause 3 required the U.K. Government to review the impact of bringing forward the start date of the windfall tax from when the Government announced it on 26th May to when Labour called for it on 9th January. Labour lost this vote by ayes 203 to noes 289</li>
</ul>
<p>Deferred Divisions were taken at the end of the Bill votes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Draft Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses (Amendment) Regulations 2022 vote was taken, and Labour voted against, losing by ayes 289 to noes 202.</li>
<li>Labour voted for the Humble Address: Liability of Trade Unions in Proceedings in Tort (Increase in Limits on Damages) Order 2022 and lost by ayes 201 to noes 290.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-07-11">House of Commons – Hansard – 11th July 2022</a></p>
<p>On Tuesday morning I attended the APPG on Liver Disease and Liver Cancer AGM and we re-elected my friend Wayne David MP Caerphilly as chair. We heard oral evidence on the need for a comprehensive review of adult liver services from Professor Stephen Ryder, Consultant Professor in Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, and a patient told us of his personal experience of late liver disease diagnosis and secondary care. The Chief Executive of British Liver Trust, Pam Healy OBE, set out the steps we need to take to raise awareness of all aspects of liver diagnosis and treatment. In May 2021, NHS England stated that they would be undertaking a national review of adult liver services, but the earliest this would happen is 2022/23.</p>
<p>Pam told members of the APPG that we need action now, because 90% of liver disease is preventable, but three quarters of people are diagnosed with cirrhosis at crisis point in hospital when it’s too late for effective treatment. Research shows that only 26% of areas in U.K. have an effective pathway for early detection and management of liver disease. Wales and in particular our Heath Board, SBUHB do have this pathway in place.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon the Petitions Committee held an informal, confidential, Roundtable on petitioning Parliament, as preliminary work, which will form part of a potential enquiry into petitioning which the Petitions Committee may decide to conduct. We heard from three academics who have researched petitions and public participation regarding: starting and signing petitions; scrutiny and public engagement with petitions; petition outcomes; and experiences beyond the U.K. Parliament.</p>
<p>We heard from: Professor of Politics at University of Leeds, Cristina Leston-Bandeira who published “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/The-Petitions-Committee-in-the-UK-Parliament-developing-a-new-style-of-public-engagement">The Petitions Committee in the U.K. Parliament developing a new style of public engagement”</a> in 2019; Professor of Politics at University of Sheffield, Felicity Matthews who focuses on researching about the exercise of power in the policy process and relationships between government, parliament, and citizens;  Professor of Democratic Politics and Deputy Director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, Alan Renwick, has vast expertise in the mechanisms through which citizens can participate formal politics, and citizens assemblies.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, I attended the regular Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group meeting to review current campaigns and to plan future campaigns that we will start in September.</p>
<p>The business in the Chamber was the remaining stages of the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137">Online Safety Bill</a> in which I couldn’t take part, nor vote on, because Parliamentary convention states that I must remain independent, as I have been a co-chair of the Online Safety Bill Committee.</p>
<p>The debate was contributed to by many members from across the Chamber, and by all members of the Bill Committee. MPs voted on the following amendments, clauses, and new clauses at the end of the debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Clause 3 required violence against women and girls (VAWG) to be on the face of the Bill and required tech companies to prevent and address VAWG as defined in the Istanbul Convention. Labour lost the division by ayes 226 to noes 292.</li>
<li>SNP Amendment 187 to add at page 186, end of line 32, schedule 7, “human trafficking, which Labour supported and lost by ayes 229 to noes 294.</li>
<li>New Clause 14, making judgements on content, outlines methods that platforms will have to use to make judgements, and that it is unworkable at scale and at pace. If this clause operates as Labour imagines it means huge amounts of content that is close to being illegal will not be acted upon. Labour opposed the new clause and lost by ayes 288 to noes 229.</li>
<li>New Clause 7, introduced by the Labour Front Bench, regarding user generated porn content, was defeated by ayes 220 to noes 285.</li>
<li>Amendment 31 required that the Secretary of State’s definition of content that is harmful to adults and content that is harmful to children must be debated on the floor of the House. Labour lost by ayes 188 to noes 283.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-07-12">House of Commons – Hansard – 12th July 2022</a></p>
<p>On Wednesday morning I signed the book of commemoration for the Srebrenica Genocide, coordinated by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Srebrenica. On Monday 11th July, twenty-seven years ago, in the first ever United Nations declared safe area, thousands of men and boys were systematically murdered and buried in mass graves. This was the worst atrocity on European soil since the Second World War, and occurred alongside forced deportation, torture, and systematic sexual violence across Bosnia by Bosnian Serb forces as part of their goal to create a “Greater Serbia”.</p>
<p>Then I joined the “Time to Care: boosting the economy and gender equality through investment in social care” Unison event. Guest speakers Christina McAnea, General Secretary of Unison; Karin Smyth, Shadow Minister for Social Care; Clare Evelyn Akoto, cabinet Member for Health and Well-being, Southwark Council; and Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, Director of the Women’s Budget Group spoke about the U.K. starting to recover from the pandemic in the face of the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation, investment in industries that have been particularly affected is needed and this can boost our flagging economy. Proper investment in social care by the U.K. Government must be considered a driver of economic recovery, rather than merely a burden on public finances.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday morning, I joined the AGM of the APPG for Dog Welfare chaired by Dr Marc Abraham BVM&amp;S MRCVS to elect officers and to plan forthcoming discussions from September, which will include dog control issues; the worrying rise in canine fertility clinics; and a documentary preview on the illegal puppy trade. We heard from guest speaker Wayne David MP Caerphilly about his recent <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2022-07-07a.1094.0&amp;s=Home+Secretary">Adjournment Debate</a> which focused on Dangerous Dogs. Wayne also spoke in the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-06/debates/E7DC68B3-E1E5-449B-B922-F3333187C8FB/Breed-SpecificLegislation">Petitions Debate</a> that I opened about the reform of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 which has not operated as it was intended to prevent dog incidents, and many dogs have been taken away from their owners because of the way they look, not because they exhibit dangerous behaviour. We all agreed that responsible dog ownership is a priority, and that the legislation must be reformed.</p>
<p>I sat in my usual spot on the very back bench at PMQs and most MPs were taken aback when Boris Johnson made what he said was his final appearance at PMQs. We were expecting his last appearance to be on Wednesday 20th July. MPs across the House wondered where he was going to be on the 20th that was more important than being at PMQs.</p>
<p>As chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism I opened an online event to discuss plant-based meals for climate friendly catering in the public sector. Earlier this year the IPCC highlighted the uptake of plant-based diets as an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/sixth-carbon-budget/">6th Carbon Budget</a> released last year by the U.K. Committee on Climate Change recommended that the government set an ambitious target for meat and dairy reduction and called on the public sector to be leaders by providing more plant-based options.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-food-strategy">Government Food Strategy</a> was finally published, which was its long-awaited response to Henry Dimbleby’s <a href="https://www.nationalfoodstrategy.org/">National Food Strategy for England</a>. We heard from Phil Rees-Jones, Director of Services for Cardiff University; Anna Taylor, Chief Independent Advisor to Henry Dimbleby; and Councillor Ian Middleton, and the Catering Operations Manager, Gail Witchell both from Oxfordshire County Council. There followed a lively Q&amp;A from the many people who joined this online event.</p>
<p>I dashed off to chair a debate in Westminster Hall led by Mike Amesbury on the provision of careers guidance in schools. The debate was well attended by MPs from across the House. <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-07-13/debates/16ADC431-015A-40EC-8731-CC36152A63C2/CareersGuidanceInSchools">Careers Guidance in Schools – Westminster Hall – 13th July 2022</a></p>
<p>The business in the Chamber was the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, and many MPs from all Parties contributed to this very important debate. Many amendments, clauses and new clauses were laid, and the following were pressed to a division:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labour Front Bench Amendment 26 required Ministers of the Crown to set out a legal justification for altering the effect of the Northern Ireland Protocol in domestic law. Labour lost the division by ayes 231 to noes 313.</li>
<li>Amendment 8 adds Article 18 (Democratic Consent in Northern Ireland) of the Northern Ireland Protocol to the list of articles that a Minister of the Crown cannot exercise powers conferred by subsection (2) and cease to have effect in the U.K. to any extent. Labour lost the division by ayes 230 to noes 308.</li>
<li>Labour opposed that clauses 15 and 16 stand part of the Bill. These clauses would give Ministers broad powers to disapply other parts of the Protocol beyond those specified under the Bill, and Ministers would be able to do this through regulations rather than primary legislation. These powers would be used on the basis of a range of “permitted purposes” which include safeguarding social and economic stability; protecting the Good Friday Agreement; and ensuring the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Labour lost the division by ayes 308 to noes 231.</li>
<li>Labour Front Bench’s New Clause 10 aimed to prevent the U.K. Government from having the power to make unilateral changes to the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way that would breach the UK’s international legal obligations and was defeated by ayes 229 to noes 300.</li>
<li>Stephen Farry MP, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, moved amendment 24, which would remove from clause 4 the measures that strip out the heart of the protocol, namely article 5 which relates to the management of the customs union and single market as they pertain to Northern Ireland, making it an excluded provision under domestic law. Labour supported this amendment, but it was defeated by ayes 212 to noes 285.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-07-13">House of Commons – Hansard – 13th July 2022</a></p>
<p>On Thursday I chaired Westminster Hall debates beginning with the Select Committee Statement on the Second Report of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-07-14/debates/22071455000001/AccessToCashInScotland">Scottish Affairs Committee: Access to Cash in Scotland</a>, HC 80, presented by Pete Wishart MP, chair of the committee. Convention of the House states that Mr Wishart had up to 10 minutes to deliver the report, then MPs could ask questions about the report, for a total of up to 10 minutes, which would be answered one question at a time by Mr Wishart. The debate was over-subscribed and unfortunately some MPs did not have the opportunity to ask their question because we ran out of time.</p>
<p>The next debate was opened by Jim Shannon MP for Strangford, and MPs considered <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-07-14/debates/57ED11CF-8E5B-4264-BB47-C13354BE03BB/NHSPPESupplyChainsForcedLabour">forced labour and NHS PPE supply chains</a>. Mr Shannon spoke at length about the terrible exploitation of adults and children who work many hours for a pittance. The SNP spokesperson, and the Opposition spokesperson agreed that this must be addressed. The Minister delivered the U.K. Government’s position and answered questions that were put to her.</p>
<p>Friday Sitting Days are back after being suspended since the first lockdown due to the pandemic. On this first Friday sitting I was privileged to present my Private Members Bill to ban the import and export of shark fins and items associated with shark fins into and out of the U.K. – <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3207">Shark Fins Bill</a></p>
<p>I was listed third on the Order Paper, and it’s always unpredictable as to how many PMBs will actually be debated, because if a PMB listed before you is “talked out”, which is in essence filibustering until time runs out at 2.30pm, or the two PMBs in front take up all the allotted time to 2.30pm that’s the end of the matter, and my PMB would fall without being heard. I was delighted when the two PMBs in front of me were supported by the U.K. Government Minister. Therefore, there was time for more PMBs to be debated, and I had the immense privilege to present my PMB.</p>
<p>Sharks are truly incredible animals that have been around for over 400 million years – long before dinosaurs. Many sharks live in U.K. waters, from basking sharks to Greenland sharks. The basking shark is the UK’s largest fish growing up to 11 metres long and weighing up to 7 tonnes, the size of a double decker bus. But out of 500 species more than a quarter are listed from vulnerable to critically endangered. Research has shown that at least 73 million sharks would have to be killed every year to match the volume of shark fins traded in the global market, that’s 1 million to 2 million tonnes a year. It is likely that shark finning is a significant driving force.</p>
<p>My PMB only applies to fins that have been removed from the body of a shark. It does not ban the sale or consumption of shark fins if the fins are removed after the shark is dead and the shark was caught legally and sustainably. This would disproportionately impact communities where shark fin soup is a traditional delicacy. My PMB makes sure that shark finning cannot take place by any vessel fishing in U.K. waters, or by any U.K. vessel fishing in non-U.K. waters.</p>
<p>And because it relates to devolved administrations, legislative consent will be sought from the devolved administrations during the passage of the Bill, but I understand that they are supportive.</p>
<p>Many MPs spoke in support of my PMB, and some stakeholders who have been campaigning for many years to ban shark finning watched from the public gallery, in particular Shark Guardian and Bite Back. At the end of the debate the Minister confirmed that the U.K. Government supported my PMB and that it would also cover banning the 20kg of dried shark fin that people are currently allowed to bring into the U.K. for personal use.</p>
<p>I felt very humble that my PMB had achieved its Second Reading and thanked everyone for their support. It will now proceed into Bill Committee in the autumn.</p>

<p>Back in the constituency, I was delighted to spend time with the <a href="https://www.peoplescollection.wales/users/66211?fbclid=IwAR1N6PT-bNp3voDyytrMRlBJjmaAsf-eUCiFCkraw2dBkbd64TbW9XiTJek">Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company</a> who have spent many years restoring the Neath Abbey Ironworks. As a vice-chair of the APPG for Industrial Heritage, at our last meeting of the APPG, I highlighted the amazing work of the Friends. I suggested that members of the APPG should visit the Ironworks, and, that the Friends should address a meeting of our APPG in Westminster.</p>
<p>I am very proud of the tremendous progress that these wonderful volunteers have made, and I look forward to welcoming colleagues of the APPG to Neath sometime in the autumn.</p>

<p>It’s always good to catch up with Brian and the team of ‘Back the Track’ volunteers. Last week I met up with them for a walk along the Mclean Way to see the great progress being made on the Track.</p>
<p>In particular, it was good to see the map of track walks and connections which the team have been working on and to see the aqueduct where bridge repairs are being undertaken.</p>
<p>The ‘Back the Track’ team of volunteers continue to do a fantastic job locally and it is good to see the Mclean Way being used and enjoyed by so many.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the walk and chat. Thank you.</p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>

<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
