<p>I am reissuing this given todays news</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article was published yesterday on ConservativeHome. I thought readers of my blog might also find it interesting:</p>
<p>We are living with a desperate shortage of energy. Successive governments and Ministers have ignored the need to ensure adequate supplies of electricity and primary fuels in their passion to close down and move out of coal, oil and gas as quickly as possible. Now we are caught up in a worldwide gas shortage, with fertiliser factories closed – and a Business Secretary summoning a meeting to ask what can be done to limit the spreading damage.</p>
<p>The Business Secretary knows enough economics to understand that, if gas is in short supply, the last thing that would help the UK procure more of it would be a series of price controls over those who dare to buy it on the world market and could sell it here.</p>
<p>We will not like it, but these now unruly global gas markets are controlled by Russia, the USA, and various Middle Eastern countries that have a surplus to export. They do not currently have a big enough surplus to need to take low bids.</p>
<p>The EU is already complaining that Russia is driving prices higher by restricting her large export supply. Why, then, did Germany make the world gas position worse by deciding to centre their energy policy on a further major addition to their pipeline capacity to import gas from Russia, ensuring their reliance on this source? They were warned by both Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as well as other allies not to make this obvious mistake.</p>
<p>The UK, too, has made itself far too dependent on energy imports. I have been warning government for years that we need to do more to generate additional power and extract more primary energy at home, endowed as we are with liberal reserves of oil, gas and coal and with access to water power and biomass.</p>
<p>The Business Secretary could do more than pose as concerned at his meeting if he puts in train work to find longer-term solutions to our chronic dependence on unreliable overseas sources of energy. He could ask why the Rough Field gas store was closed down, greatly reducing our stocks of gas which we now need. He should bring in more gas storage. He could review North Sea oil and gas policy, and see how the industry can be encouraged to tap more reserves from our own fields. He should keep the remaining coal power stations available with secure coal supplies for them, until there is sufficient greener power available to replace them on a reliable basis.</p>
<p>He should know that, at exactly the same time as we hit a world gas shortage, the UK electricity supply is under extreme stress. The remaining three coal power stations have been fired up, because there has been a marked shortage of wind for some weeks.</p>
<p>In recent years I have been wearing my keyboard out raising with Ministers and the wider public the issue of our need for more reliable electrical power to keep the lights on. The overriding preference for wind power was bound to leave us vulnerable to periods of calm weather.</p>
<p>If these coincide with cold winter days, the consequences could be disastrous. A modern sophisticated economy needs electrical power for most things. How would food factories keep working, vulnerable people stay warm at home, hospitals look after patients without sufficient power? It is particularly worrying that the current shortage takes place against a background of limited demand thanks to mild weather. The cool summer in the south did not help, as heating thermostats were triggering as late as May and even in August, needing more gas-fired power even then.</p>
<p>The UK’s passion for imported electricity has further weakened our position. The French interconnector in Kent was badly burned this week, taking out a potential imported supply of top up power which we rely too much on. We may discover soon that, if the shortages worsen, overseas suppliers will see exporting to us as an easy cut to make to husband their own limited supplies for domestic use.</p>
<p>When electricity was first privatised, we made security of supply the prime issue in the new system. There was a substantial margin of extra domestic capacity available to bring on stream if one or more of the baseload generating plants had problems. We did not need imports.  We made price the second important issue, with a system which always ensured the next cheapest power was brought on stream as demand picked up. In the early years of privatisation we both had plenty of capacity at home, and experienced falling prices. The dash for gas, with many new combined cycle gas plants going in, took feedstock from a healthy UK North Sea and replaced some older less fuel efficient and dirtier coal capacity, so the policy was also green.</p>
<p>Today, the Business Secretary needs to review the complex mesh of subsidies, regulations, penalty taxes and import arrangements that passes for an energy policy. It is delivering a shortage of power. It is holding up a good industrial strategy, as industrial expansion needs access to plenty of reliable competitively priced energy. It is now threatening consumers with much higher electricity and gas prices.</p>
<p>He should order changes that will open up more UK primary energy for us to use. He should want an electricity system that has more reliable renewable power which may take the form of hydro, pump storage and battery, but which also has enough back up capacity from biomass or gas, so we can be sure to keep the factories powered up.</p>
<p>Elimination of our dependence on imported electricity and a substantial reduction in our dependence on imported gas should be a minimum objective. The market would do this if it were allowed to function but, because of the comprehensive muddle of government-inspired past interventions, it now needs dramatic government action to put it right for the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we rely on the goodwill of the gas and electricity exporters and will have to pay up to secure supplies. It is the perfect storm, with both gas and electricity scarce. At home, an absence of wind leaves us short, and abroad Hurricane Ida closed down some important US gas capacity. Relying on the wind is a dangerous way of living.</p>

              <h3>Martin Docherty (West Dunbartonshire)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>MP for West Dunbartonshire Martin Docherty-Hughes is calling on new Prime Minister Liz Truss to give the right to paid leave for parents who experience miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>



<p>Ahead of the second reading of the Miscarriage Leave Bill in the Commons, local SNP MP Martin has signed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12cGYQY-4wlq9j0MkgrW2mnZbS9PymtUR/view?usp=sharing">cross-party letter </a>to Prime Minister Liz Truss and Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Jacob Rees-Mogg calling for the UK government to review its position and back the Bill.</p>



<p>If successful, the Miscarriage Leave Bill would introduce a statutory right for parents to a minimum of three-days paid leave in the event of a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or molar pregnancy.</p>



<p>The letter has been supported by 50 MPs from eight parties and independents as well as the Miscarriage Association, Mumsnet, Miscarriage Support, the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, Tommy’s, Sands, SiMBA and campaigner Keeley Lengthorn.</p>



<p>Introduced by SNP MP Angela Crawley (Lanark and Hamilton East) under the Ten Minute Rule, the Miscarriage Leave Bill is set to&nbsp;receive its second reading in December.</p>



<p>Up to one in four pregnancies will end in miscarriage however, there is currently no provision in place to support grieving parents through their loss&nbsp;before 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>



<p>Countries including Australia and New Zealand have already introduced paid miscarriage leave and Northern Ireland is set to do so before&nbsp;2026.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>“There are many families in West Dunbartonshire who have gone through a miscarriage. It can be a devastating experience and there should be no concerns about having to take sick leave from work.</p>



<p>“I hope the Prime Minister listens to our campaign. I will be pressing the UK government to support the Miscarriage Leave Bill when it returns to the Commons for its second reading.</p>



<p>“By offering a statutory right to paid leave for parents who experience miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy, the UK can take a positive step towards ending the stigma associated with pregnancy loss.</p>



<p>““There is no cut off point for grief so there should not be a cut off point for providing&nbsp;support to parents who experience miscarriage.”</p>



<p><strong>SNP MP Angela Crawley added:</strong></p>



<p>“A new Prime Minister brings a change to the heart of government and with that there is an opportunity for them to review and change their stance on miscarriage leave.</p>



<p>“My Private Members’ Bill will return to the Commons in December and I am hopeful that the new government will get behind it and support parents who experience miscarriage.</p>



<p>“By providing a statutory right to paid leave in the event of a miscarriage, we can challenge the stigma and allow parents to properly grieve their loss.”</p>



<p><strong>Miscarriage Association National Director Ruth Bender Atik said:</strong></p>



<p>“For many people, miscarriage is the loss of a baby, however early it happens, and is often felt as a bereavement like any other.</p>



<p>“A period of statutory leave would not only allow people some time off to start their recovery, but it would also be a clear public recognition that pregnancy loss can have a very real and significant impact on those going through it.</p>



<p>“We wholeheartedly support this bill and hope the Government will take this opportunity to support people at a what can be an extremely difficult and distressing time.”</p>

<p>Liz Truss has had a historically bad start to her new job, and we’re all paying the price. To appreciate the full scale of what went wrong, I think it’s useful to provide a quick recap.</p>
<p>The Friday before last, Kwasi Kwarteng stepped up to the Despatch Box to deliver a ‘mini-budget’, which would set out Liz Truss’ economic policies to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. I know that many people across Tameside would have tuned in hoping to see the Government take action to provide families with the support they need, to tackle stagnant wages and to build a resilient and forward-thinking economy.</p>
<p>What they did was the exact opposite. The Chancellor announced enormous, unfunded tac cuts to those who earn millions and the very richest companies. He lifted the cap on banker&#8217;s bonuses and did away with the top rate of income tax.</p>
<p>The reaction of the markets was almost instant, the value of the pound dived, and instead of changing course, Truss ploughed on. The following week, the Bank of England had to spend £65bn to prevent pension funds from going bust. Mortgage lenders pulled offers and increased interest rates, and trust in the Tory Government plummeted to historic lows.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Government performed a screeching U-turn. It declared that it wouldn’t scrap the top rate of tax (but stayed noticeably quiet on banker&#8217;s bonuses). Unfortunately, by the time the U-turn came, the damage to the UK economy had been done. Millions of people – already struggling with the cost-of-living crisis – will see higher mortgages and higher prices for years.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear. This shambles was no accident. The Government wilfully ignored expert advice. When the Office for Budget Responsibility came to the Chancellor before the mini-budget, and offered to carry out an independent assessment as is typical, he refused. The people of Tameside are now paying the price for incompetence, ideological arrogance, and downright neglect.</p>
<p>Politics isn’t a game. The British public are not test subjects in a bizarre Tory economic experiment. When a Chancellor stands up in Parliament, they have lives, livelihoods, and security in their hands. It is an extraordinary responsibility, and one that the Tories just don’t understand.</p>
<p>Enough is enough. The Tories are the party of economic irresponsibility and instability. Labour are the only party which will provide responsible finances, strong fiscal rules and fair, long-term growth for the people of Tameside.</p>

<p><strong>The Tories don&#8217;t take science seriously.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I wish the new Science Minister well in her new position but the problem is the Tories just aren&#8217;t serious about science. We have had:</strong></p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>&#x20e3;</strong><strong>    Changes of Minister in 4 years</strong></p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>&#x20e3;</strong><strong>    Months without replacing the Science Minister position</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Government&#8217;s record on science speaks for itself </strong><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>It has also been revealed that Liz Truss is chairing just 3 of her cabinet committees &#8211; none of which have a science focus. Comparatively, Boris Johnson chaired 11 of his 20 committees &#8211; including the National Space Council.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After just three meetings and one year, Liz Truss has disbanded the National Science and Technology Council. The NSTC was established in 2021 to help make the UK a &#8216;global science superpower&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UK has a world-beating science base: we rank third, only behind the US in China in Science and Technology journal articles. Due to Tory lack of investment and strategy, we do not convert our rich science base into a high skill, high wage, high-productivity economy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The average science minister lasts 9 months. We have had ‘Innovation strategy’, an ‘R&amp;D roadmap’, a ‘science plan’, an ‘Office for Science and Technology Strategy,’ ‘grand challenges’, industrial strategies, ‘sector deals’, ARIA and 2 re-organisations of UKRI.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ‘Shared Prosperity Fund’ represents a 43% cut compared to previous funding, harming regions which were already in desperate need of investment. Concentration on GSE excludes the rest of the UK from growth, prosperity &amp; opportunity science provides.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The number 1 issue for UK based scientists and researchers right now is participation in the European Union&#8217;s Horizon Funding programme.  Losing access to Horizon would be a disaster for the UK’s leading researchers who&#8217;ve already lost collaborative opportunities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Government claimed to have a &#8216;Plan B&#8217; for Horizon Europe. But after years of chaos and broken promises, we had the (now ex) Science Minister lobbying his own Government on Twitter to try and get the Treasury to properly fund a &#8216;Plan B&#8217; alternative. </strong><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2049.png" alt="⁉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has branded the Tory Government’s Budget a “mortgage bombshell” for families in the constituency. This comes as details have emerged showing each household will pay circa £1,500 per year more in higher interest payments.</p>
<p>The average rate on a two-year fixed-rate deal increased by an entire percentage point between last Monday and yesterday to 5.75 per cent, a post-financial crisis high.</p>
<p>The rise raised monthly repayments on a £200,000 home loan by £124 a month to £1,167 — £1,486 more a year. Last December the average rate on a two-year fix was 2.34%.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the so-called Mini-Budget the Conservative Government has been buffeted by market turmoil as the cost of government borrowing has rocketed – which directly affects the cost of people’s mortgages and other borrowing. </p>
<p>The actions of the Tories also saw the pound crash in value. This resulted in the Bank of England having to bail the Government out to the tune of £65 billion. If no action would have been taken it was believed that several large pension schemes would have gone bust.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“The Tory Government’s management of the economy has been nothing short of catastrophic. The actions of the Prime Minister and her Chancellor have placed a mortgage bombshell under households in south Bristol. On average households will now see a Tory premium of £1,500 per year added to their mortgage repayment: money people cannot afford.</p>
<p>“This is an economic crisis made in Downing Street, paid for by working people. </p>
<p>“The Chancellor’s recent speech to Tory Party Conference showed him to be completely out of touch. He mentioned “turbulence” being experienced in the hope of laughing off his mismanagement. It’s clear that the Tory Government cannot be trusted to run our economy. A Labour Government will bring regain the UK’s reputation for sound management of our finances and ensure the cost-of-living crisis is ended.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/10/04/karin-smyth-mp-brands-tory-governments-budget-a-mortgage-bombshell-for-families-in-bristol-south/">Karin Smyth MP brands Tory Government’s Budget a “mortgage bombshell” for families in Bristol South</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p>Tim finished the race in 4 hours 32 minutes and 37 seconds - 12 minutes faster than his effort last year.</p>
<p>The Great North Air Ambulance Service, who are celebrating their 20th anniversary this year, is funded entirely by donations from the public.</p>
<p>The charity provides the air ambulance service for Cumbria. From its base in Langwathby near Penrith it can reach any part of the county in just 15 minutes at speeds of 190mph.</p>
<p>Speaking after the run, Tim said: <em>"26 miles is a long way, but the only thing you can do is just keep plodding, soaking up the atmosphere of such a great day. It was a privilege to wear the Great North Air Ambulance vest and to know that we were raising funds for such a vital cause'</em></p>
<p><em>I am hugely grateful to everyone who sponsored me and in turn supported the Great North Air Ambulance Service.</em> <em>They are a wonderful charity who work tirelessly to save lives."</em></p>
<p>Tracey Wright, events co-ordinator at GNAAS, said: <em>"We'd like to offer a massive congratulations to Tim for not only completing a marathon, but beating his previous time by 12 minutes, which is amazing.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Tim has raised a fantastic amount of money for our charity, which will enable our team to continue saving lives across the region, so we want to pass on our thanks to him and everyone who sponsored him."</em>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p><strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong></p>
<p>I am writing to you to ask for your help with a new local initiative that I have been working on with <strong>Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell, </strong>the local branch of Citizens Advice and <strong>Good Company</strong> which runs five food bank centres in Epsom and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The current energy crisis is putting huge pressures on many people locally.  Although prices are being frozen for the next two years, and every household will receive a £400 discount on their energy bills this winter, paid over a six month period, many households are still struggling with the increases that have already taken place.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to the crisis is to improve energy efficiency for those who are struggling to pay their bills. But all too often people either do not know what solutions are available or cannot afford them or both.</p>
<p>The <strong>Epsom and Ewell Energy Support Scheme</strong> is a plan to offer those running into difficulties immediate help with their bills, and then advice and financial support to improve energy efficiency or reduce energy consumption in their homes and so reduce bills going forward. This might include buying a more efficient appliance for them or helping with improved insulation.</p>
<p>To help support this programme we are asking local households who have less difficulty paying for these higher energy bills to donate their £400 support payments to the fund so that it can be used to help reduce the bills of those who are struggling. If you are able to do this, we would be very grateful, and all other donations are of course also very welcome.</p>
<p>As I said, the Scheme is being run jointly by the Good Company, which runs the local food bank, and Citizens Advice Epsom &amp; Ewell helped by local Churches. It will offer both advice sessions to help those who are not sure how to improve their energy efficiency as well as assistance paying for improvements.</p>
<p>If you can help, I would be very grateful. To make a donation, please visit our donations page at <strong><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qha4CRO3xsv5RPExUNaYzD?domain=justgiving.com">www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></strong>.  If you would like any further information, please drop me an email.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to support this programme.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>“There are decades where nothing happens and there are
weeks where decades happen.”</p>



<p>None more so than last month when in the space of only a
few days we saw the appointment of our fourth Prime Minister in the last six
years quickly followed by the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>



<p>The Queen was a loyal and faithful public servant who
took her responsibilities seriously, dedicating her life to serving the British
people.&nbsp; An influential figure and a
much-loved, reassuring presence for many generations, she will be greatly
missed.</p>



<p>Her successor, King Charles III, will now need to show
the same level of empathy and understanding as he faces up to the years ahead
as Head of State not only for the United Kingdom but for many other countries
around the world too.&nbsp; His surefootedness
in the days immediately after her death, whilst at the same time grieving the
loss of her not only as a monarch but, more importantly, as his mother was a
positive start.</p>



<p>Now the official mourning period has ended, he has a
clear time window in which to set out his stall as the new King.&nbsp; The next few months will be key.&nbsp; What happens in the coming days and weeks
will decide how he is received by the public and how he will be judged for the
remainder of his reign.</p>



<p>The same can be said, of course, about Liz Truss, our new
Prime Minister.&nbsp; After what seemed to be
a never-ending summer of debate within the Tory Party, she finally emerged as
the victorious candidate.</p>



<p>Taking office at one of the most turbulent times in
recent history, she had only two days inside 10 Downing Street before everything
was turned upside down by the news coming from Balmoral.&nbsp; In that brief time, she had already set about
appointing the least experienced, most extreme Cabinet she could think of.&nbsp; Jettisoning to the backbenches anyone who had
not shown complete and utter devotion to her previously, it seems personal
loyalty came before any sense of assembling the best talents for the new PM.</p>



<p>Her only major announcement before the suspension of Parliament
was on energy prices with a proposal for an energy price guarantee so that the
average domestic energy bill will be no more than £2,500 per year for two years
from October 2022.&nbsp; Totally avoiding any
questions relating to the overall cost of this policy, Truss also failed to
outline that her plans would in fact see richer people receiving twice the
amount of help than the poorest.&nbsp; Neither
fair nor particularly effective.</p>



<p>I am pleased that the Prime Minister has finally accepted
the principle of a price limit. However, under her Government’s plan prices
will still rise considerably. The plan put forward by Labour, on the other
hand, would ensure that there would not be a single penny more on bills.</p>



<p>There is also a crucial question about who pays for these
measures. The Treasury estimates that energy companies could make £170 billion
in unexpected windfall profits over the next two years. That is why I have
supported a windfall tax since January and why I want to see the windfall tax
expanded.&nbsp; Sadly, the Prime Minister has chosen to leave these vast
profits on the table and instead let working people pick up the bill.</p>



<p>In addition to the cost of living crisis, the new Prime
Minister will have to deal with other pressing matters including how to prevent the expected NHS crisis in
England, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, finding a way through the Northern
Ireland Protocol difficulties and dealing with our Net Zero by 2050 climate
change commitments whilst securing our energy supply for the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With
polling suggesting that voters become less impressed with her, the more they
see of her, she has a huge challenge to set convince the British public that
she can really make a difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How will it all work
out?&nbsp; Only time will tell.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>Last month, we reflected with a mixture of great sadness and huge sense of loss, but also remembered with great joy the inspiration which Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II gave in devoting her life to the service of others. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>She set an example not just to those in public life, but to all of us: how to behave, how to help others, how to bring people together and make people happy. She was the mother of the Nation, the founder of the Commonwealth and the senior stateswoman of the globe. The world shares in our grief. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Sir Winston Churchill, her first of 15 Prime Ministers, heralded her Accession to the throne as launching “a golden age” - “a signal for a brightening salvation of the human scene”. And so it proved in so many areas of human endeavour and achievement by her and her subjects over these past 70 years.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We shall probably all remember where we were when we heard the news of Her Majesty’s death. Although she was 96 this still came as a lightning bolt of shock in the midst of thunderstorms raging across her Kingdom that day.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I was with members of the Environmental Audit Committee, at a half-full reservoir in Cornwall surrounded by trees.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This seemed strangely fitting, giving the commitment Her Majesty showed to the environment. Through her love of nature, she and her devoted husband Prince Philip the late Duke of Edinburgh undoubtedly planted the seed for their family’s enthusiasm in championing nature and leading the crusade to combat climate change, decades before this became fashionable.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Only last November in her message to international leaders and delegates attending COP26 she said: “The time for words has now moved to the time for action”.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But it was her love of trees that will be a lasting physical legacy. I suspect she planted more than anyone else in public life around the globe.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Platinum Jubilee Queen’s Canopy has seen a million trees planted this year alone in her honour, which will be a lasting reminder of her for decades if not hundreds of years to come.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Her only official visit to the Ludlow constituency was in the year after her Golden Jubilee, when she came by royal train to Telford and visited Much Wenlock with Prince Philip to take in the Wenlock Olympian Games, an early precursor to her role in London 2012.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>She then showed that her priorities lay with her people, by having lunch in the Discovery Centre in Craven Arms, rather than the gourmet delights of Ludlow. She went on to do a walkabout in the Market Square in Ludlow, where thousands turned out to welcome the first visit by a reigning monarch in more than 300 years. Most visits by earlier monarchs before that had been at the head of an army.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>My sincere condolences to the Royal Family on the loss of their, and our, matriarch and monarch.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I know many constituents will join me in wishing His Majesty King Charles III well as he takes up his duties as our Sovereign. It was heart-warming to see that whilst Parliamentarians paid tribute to his Mother in the Chamber on the day after her death, King Charles walked among the well-wishers outside Buckingham Palace. Her example of engaging with us all is already being carried on by her successor. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I write before the State Funeral has taken place which I am sure will give us all the opportunity to mourn her passing in fitting style. God rest Her Majesty. God save the King.</span></span></span></p></div>

<p>It was Harold Wilson who once quipped that ‘a week is a long time in politics’. Goodness knows what he’d have made of the last 6 days.</p>



<p>On Friday our new Chancellor announced more than £400billion of borrowing and tax cuts worth an extra £55,000 for millionaires. Almost immediately there was panic in the markets, questions about fairness and doubts about Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng as the pound plunged in value. There’s a genuine possibility it could be worth less than a dollar by the start of the Tory conference in Birmingham.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m in Liverpool this week where Labour is setting out an alternative approach.</p>



<p>We got off to a good start with Keir Starmer showing, in his tribute to our late Queen, the kind of leadership we need from a Prime Minister. We’ve also made clear that our spending will be on priorities like health not the pockets of millionaires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I always like to balance the drama of conference with meetings related to issues affecting my constituency. My first call was to catch up with the disability charity Sense, who own the fantastic Touchbase Pears centre on Bristol Road. I’ve also been talking to JLR about supply chain issues, energy costs and the pound, as well as their exciting plans to recycle materials using a circular production model. As mortgage rates rise, I’ve been meeting Shelter to consider plans for new builds, affordable rent, and measures to tackle homelessness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are the things that a Labour government will address through new, energy-efficient homes, vastly improved health and care services and thousands of jobs produced by our green industrial revolution.</p>



<p>There’s a quiet determination at this conference. There’s no triumphalism, just a desire to serve. Labour is at its best when it returns to this position.</p>



<p>There are no ludicrous offers, no ridiculous claims, just the simple statement that things do not need to be this bad and with Labour there can be a fresh start and a fairer, greener Britain. Keir Starmer has shown he’s ready to be our next Prime Minister and that under Labour things can only get better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. This is called swearing in. Members can either swear in using a religious text or take a non-religious, solemn affirmation. They do this before taking their seats in Parliament. This can happen after a general election or by-election.</p>



<p>As in this case, swearing in also happens after the death of the Monarch: for members of the House of Lords this is an obligation but for MPs it is optional and not doing so has no effect on them taking their seat or participating in business.</p>

<p>Mr MacNeil also warned that reports from the Prime Minister Liz Truss that no household would pay more than £2500 were inaccurate and had led to the spread of misinformation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He said: “Householders should take a meter reading by October 1 and then submit it to your energy provider. The reading does not have to be submitted on that day as this has previously crashed the systems but please ensure that meter readings are taken and noted, even take a photo of the reading for evidence, and then submit within a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nobody wants the September usage to be estimated into October usage because it will be a higher price. Also, in October you will be using more electricity.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h2><a href="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/2022/09/27/bust-budget/">Bust Budget</a></h2>
              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>On Friday the new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced what he described as a mini-budget to help deal with the cost of living crisis. The only thing mini about it was the amount of support it provides to the average family and individual in Britain. This completely un-costed budget, will give out the largest tax cuts since 1972, most of which are aimed at the wealthiest in society. That budget in 1972 lead to a short-lived boom, and a much longer bust, with the infamous three-day week and the failure of key services.</p>



<p>The tax cuts in this mini budget, are mainly for the super wealthy, for corporations and for the bankers. The top tax rate of 45p (%) has been completely removed, which is great news for those lucky few that earn over £150,000 a year. Corporation tax increases have been discarded, and the cap on bankers’ bonuses brought in after the financial crisis of 2008 have been scrapped.</p>



<p>But the Tories aren’t content with just giving handouts to the rich, they have also increased the number of Universal Credit recipients who have to actively search for work and attend weekly or fortnightly job centre appointments, if they are working up to 15 hours a week. If they don’t then their benefits will be reduced. Unsurprisingly the mini-budget also attacks trade union rights further, making it harder for working people to strike for the pay and conditions they deserve.</p>



<p>While they have suspended National Insurance increases and cut stamp duty, this support is minute compare to the support for those best off in society. Even in terms of energy bill support, prices being frozen where they are now, simply means they are only twice what they were last year, at the same time that the price for everything else from food to transport is increasing, while wages and benefits remain completely stagnant.</p>



<p>This budget does not serve the needs of the people of Nottingham, it does not help those who need help the most. People earning £20,000 will only save £167 a year. What it will do is drive Britain into an inflationary spiral. It will cause the prices of the goods that residents need to survive to increase further, at a time where benefits and wages are not rising. This will wipe out any gains that residents in the city see from this mini-budget.</p>

<p>The Tories say their budget will stimulate growth; it remains to be seen if it will. What is certain though is that growth in the economy is pointless if it does not lead to increased wages for the average person, if people are not supported to re-skill and obtain jobs in growing sectors, and if people do not have access to suitable affordable housing, whether that’s via home ownership or renting.</p>



<p>The mini budget does nothing to help achieve these aims, Nottingham Labour strongly believe that the budget will not help the people of Nottingham, it will only help a tiny minority of people. A Labour government is needed nationally to give the people of this country and of Nottingham the support and help that they need, and that they deserve.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan, starting a new era focused on economic growth, whilst tackling the immediate energy crisis and removing barriers for businesses to build the infrastructure we need to grow the British economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan puts more money in people’s pockets by cutting National Insurance and Income Tax – including an extra £330 a year from the cut to National Insurance contributions and saving families £1,400 on their energy bills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To deliver on this mission, the Chancellor has also announced 38 Investment Zones and over 100 infrastructure projects across the country to drive the investment and growth in the areas that need it the most.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today the Conservative Government delivered The Growth Plan – setting out support for families with their energy bills and unleashing a new era of growth through tax cuts and investment incentives.</p>
<p>Matt Warman MP has welcomed the Chancellor’s measures set out for families across Boston and Skegness who will have their energy bills cut by up to £1,400 through the Energy Price Guarantee, whilst businesses eligible for The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will have their energy bills slashed by cutting the price of wholesale gas.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also confirmed people across the East Midlands will benefit from personal tax cuts – cutting National Insurance contributions by 1.25 per cent, putting an extra £330 a year in people’s pockets and helping them with cost-of-living pressures.</p>
<p>This means two million people across the East Midlands region will save £255 a year thanks to the cut to National Insurance contributions, and 2.4 million people across the East Midlands will save £160 a year thanks to the slash to Income tax in 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside these measures the Conservative Government announced further personal cuts – including cutting stamp duty permanently by doubling the nil-rate band to £250,000 (from £125,000), increasing the nil-rate band for first time buyers to £425,000 (from £300,000) and increasing the value of the property which first-time buyers can claim relief to £625,000 from (£500,000).</p>
<p>These measures combined mean a typical family moving into a semi-detached property will save £2,500 on stamp duty and £1,150 on energy bills – and if they have a combined income of £50,000 around an additional £560 on tax. This is around £4,200 in total.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government’s Growth Plan also unleashes 38 Investment Zones across England, unlocking housing and driving growth through tax incentives and over 100 infrastructure projects that will be accelerated.</p>
<p>These measures will unleash growth through tax cuts and reform, tackle the immediate energy crisis, removing barriers for business, and building the infrastructure needed to grow the British economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman MP said:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong>“In the face of rising energy prices and cost of living pressures it is right that this Conservative Government has come forward with a serious support package and a plan for growth.</em></p>
<p><em>“I welcome support set out for people across Boston and Skegness today, including cuts to National Insurance contributions, Income Tax and Stamp Duty – all helping families to keep more of their hard-earned money.</em></p>
<p><em>“Only the Conservatives can be trusted to make the reforms we need to grow our economy – delivering higher wages, lower taxes and more money for our public services.”</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Commenting, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Growth is not as high as it should be. This has made it harder to pay for public services, requiring taxes to rise and cost of living pressures to increase.</em></p>
<p><em>“We need to change this and be unashamed in our Growth Plan – expanding the supply side of the economy, through tax incentives and reform, whilst we help families now by cutting their energy bills by £1,400 a year and slashing personal taxes.</em></p>
<p><em>“That is how we will deliver higher wages, greater opportunities, and crucially, fund public services, now and into the future.”</em></p>

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong>Yesterday in Parliament, Judith called on the new Health Secretary to take decisive action on improving access to NHS dentistry, saying the Government’s proposals do not go nearly far enough.</strong></p>



<p>Making her first statement in the House of Commons today, Secretary of State Thérèse Coffey MP announced health reforms.</p>



<p>Questioning the Health Secretary in response to the statement, Judith asked:</p>



<p>“With 9 out of 10 dental practices in England not accepting new NHS patients and with over 2000 dentists leaving the NHS in the last year alone, NHS dentistry is in crisis. So whilst today’s small changes are welcome, alongside the minor tweaks back in July, they are underwhelming given the scale of the crisis. &nbsp;So when will the Secretary of State make full contract reform, with prevention at its heart, so that my constituents can access an NHS dentist when they need to?”</p>



<p>Responding, Thérèse Coffey MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care said: “Well, the honourable lady is absolutely right and I completely agree with her – it is a real problem. We have started doing some changes already and we need to do that in more detail right across the country. My honourable friend the minister will be looking at that more intensely.”</p>



<p>Judith has sent a cross-party letter including 60 other MPs to the new Prime Minister Liz Truss, warning that NHS dentistry is on ‘life support’ and calling for proper resources and reform to halt what the British Dental Association have called NHS Dentistry’s ‘slow death’.</p>



<p>Speaking afterwards, Judith said: “While I’m glad the new Secretary says she ‘absolutely’ agrees with me, today’s announcements do very little to solve the problem. 98% of dentists in Bradford are closed to NHS patients. There is no point the government publishing that information online, if they’re doing nothing to improve the availability of appointments in the first place, or ensuring that NHS dentists stay in the NHS.</p>



<p>“Minister after Minister has promised to fix this and none have delivered. This needs decisive reform, not the minor tweaks announced, to save NHS dentistry from collapse and make sure people across Bradford can get an NHS dentist when they need them.”</p>



<p>“My constituents in Bradford South have waited long enough and the Government’s ambition does not match the scale of the task. This needs more than words and promises, it needs action.”</p>

<p>&#8220;Like many in this House, I had the opportunity to meet and speak to the Queen on numerous occasions, but unfortunately the relationship did not start particularly auspiciously. I was invited to Buckingham Palace for what, as other Members will know, is an ancient, complex process of becoming a Privy Councillor. It was so complicated that I was called to a side room with five colleagues to have the process explained. We were told, &#8216;You will enter a large hall in Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty will stand at one end. You will kneel on the red cushions, which go back some distance, on your right knees, holding a Bible in your right hand. You will switch that to your left hand, then take the Sovereign’s hand with your right hand and brush her hand, then stand and say, ‘Your Majesty.&#8217; I thought, &#8216;Brush her hand? Was that an instruction to brush her hand with my hand? With my sleeve? Or with a handkerchief?&#8217; As I was about to ask, we were called into the performance of the great ceremony itself. I thought, &#8216;No matter, I am fifth in the line to become a Privy Councillor, so I will watch my colleagues.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;My colleagues were all swearing on the New Testament, but as I am Jewish I was swearing on the Old Testament. I was at the back of the line and I thought that I would watch what was happening. Unfortunately, as we went into this large hallway, I found that it was so long that I could not see what was happening in the ceremony at the front. As I got closer, the field of view narrowed and the girth of my colleague in front of me widened, and I still could not see what brushing the hand actually entailed. With palpitations, I nervously knelt in front of Her Majesty The Queen, on the red cushion right before her. I switched the Bible, the Pentateuch, from my right to my left hand, and stretched out my right hand. She stretched out her bare, ungloved right hand and, to my surprise, moved it towards my face. It moved towards my lips. I pursed my lips. And it stuck! For what felt like an age she tried to pull it away and then, suddenly, “pop!”, her hand pulled away. I wanted the ground beneath me in Buckingham Palace to swallow me whole, but I remembered to stand up. &#8216;Your Majesty,&#8217; I quavered. She looked me right in the eyes with those wonderful sparkling eyes, as if both to acknowledge what had happened and also to forgive me in one turn. She said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217;. Mr Speaker, we never spoke of it again. </p>



<p>&#8220;God save the King.&#8221;</p>

<p>I offer my deepest condolences to the King and Royal Family upon the sad death of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. The entire nation will mourn with them as we contemplate her remarkable reign. <br>  <br>Throughout her long life, Her Majesty’s devotion to public service has been an inspiration, and her wisdom and strength have often provided solace to her people in times of darkness, most recently during the pandemic. <br>  <br>While Her Majesty’s passing is a source of profound sadness, we should also celebrate the extraordinary period in British history over which she reigned. Like so many, I feel privileged and lucky to have lived through the second Elizabethan age. <br>  <br>By her grace and dignity, Her Majesty touched the lives of millions, and she will live on in our hearts. <br>  <br>Long Live the King.</p>

As an MP since 2010, I am used to having abuse hurled at me. Every Member of Parliament gets used to it, often from our time as candidates.

<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">The roll out of the Covid autumn booster vaccine begins today (Thursday, September 1st) in Wales.</span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">Those who are eligible will be invited to have it this autumn. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">We’ll let you know when it’s your turn and where you need to go. There is no need to contact the health board or your GP to ask for an appointment. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">Please be patient.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">If you’re eligible, you’ll receive an invite to have the booster at one location. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">This could be one of our local vaccination centres (Canolfan Gorseinon or Aberafan Shopping Centre), a community pharmacy or your GP surgery.</span></p>

<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">If you’re missing a booster you’ll move on to receive your autumn booster only, as this will be sufficient to increase your protection. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;">The Covid autumn booster will support the immunity of those who are at greatest risk from the disease, improving their protection against severe illness and helping to protect the NHS during what is likely to be another challenging winter.</span></p>

<p>The cost of living crisis is the biggest issue facing our country at the moment. With food prices increasing, heating bills going up and taxes rising, I know this is a very difficult time for many families in Hampstead and Kilburn and across the country.</p>



<p>If you are struggling to keep up with rising costs, angry about the lack of help, or are confused about what support is available to you:&nbsp;<strong>you are not alone.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you do need help with the cost of living crisis, I have set up this page to signpost some of the available support and advice from some fantastic organisations. I am of course pushing the Government to provide much more support for families during this crisis, but I hope this page will be helpful in explaining some of the support that is currently available. </p>



<p>If there is anything I can do to help or if you have any questions &#8211; or if you help to run or know of any organisations which should be added to this list &#8211; please email me at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x74;&#117;&#x6c;&#105;&#x70;&#64;&#x74;&#117;&#x6c;&#105;&#x70;&#115;&#x69;&#100;&#x64;&#105;&#x71;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#116;&#x75;l&#x69;p&#x40;t&#117;&#x6c;i&#x70;s&#x69;d&#100;&#x69;q&#x2e;c&#x6f;m</a></p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my August email newsletter. It has been an eventful few weeks in British politics, with the resignation of Boris Johnson launching a leadership contest in which we are now in the final stage. Conservative Party members up and down the country will now decide whether Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss will become the next Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister.</p>



<p>In this newsletter, you will find updates on: the Conservative Party leadership contest, local bus services, my work with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, local community action projects, and my annual summer survey to hear what you think.</p>



<h1>Leadership contest &#8211; and online poll:</h1>



<p>As&nbsp;you will be aware, Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister on the 7th July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his time in office, Boris Johnson achieved much, getting Brexit done; organising one of the fastest Covid-19 vaccination programs in the world; and supporting Ukraine against the unprovoked aggression of Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is now a process that must be followed to select the next Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. This process involves the Parliamentary Conservative Party selecting two final candidates through a series of votes. These two candidates are now&nbsp;put to a vote with all members of the Conservative Party up and down the country, and the winner of this vote becomes the leader of the party and Prime Minister. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been selected as the final two candidates to enter the vote with Conservative Party members.</p>



<p>At the beginning of this leadership campaign, I created a poll to better understand your views on the candidates and your favourite to become leader and Prime Minister. We had a fantastic response to that poll, and I would like to thank those of you who took the time to complete it.</p>



<p>Now that we are in the final stage of the leadership election, with Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss selected as the final two candidates, I have created another poll for you to share your views about these two candidates. Like the previous poll, it should only take a minute or two to complete and I would be very interested to learn what you think about the final candidates.</p>



<p>You can find the poll <a href="https://nigelmillsmp.com/conservative-leadership-poll/">here</a>.</p>



<h1>Transpeak bus service:</h1>



<p>I am pleased to inform residents that the Transpeak bus connecting Derby and Buxton, through Belper and Ambergate, will continue. The service was due to be reduced to just one bus a day in each direction from Sunday, 10th July onwards. However, thanks to a funding boost from Derbyshire County Council the bus will continue to run at the same level of service as before – once an hour from Monday to Saturday, and once every two hours on Sunday.</p>



<p>The bus is set to be subsidised for up to 6 months to allow time for passenger numbers to recover, as they are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. I have been calling for Government funding to be used by Derbyshire County Council to maintain existing services for some time, so I thoroughly welcome this decision.</p>



<p>I know residents have also raised the issue of the 1A bus service through Waingroves with me, so I&#8217;ve also been raising this issue with the County Council. </p>



<h1>The Organisation for Security &amp; Co-operation in Europe:</h1>



<p>From the 2nd-6th July, I attended the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) annual session in Birmingham, in which over 300 delegates from 56 parliaments met to discuss the future of international security in Europe. In the face of Russia’s barbaric and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the current state of security and co-operation in Europe is at its most precarious since the end of the cold war. Summits like these are, therefore, absolutely vital for maintaining cooperation and order throughout Europe and the rest of the world.</p>



<p>I attended as a member of a cross-party delegation of 10 MPs and Peers led by John Whittingdale MP. During the session, the Parliamentary Assembly strongly denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Agreeing upon a resolution that “calls upon the Russian Federation to establish an immediate ceasefire and withdraw Russian troops from the whole of Ukraine.”</p>



<p>Further committee sessions discussed human rights, victims of terror attacks, the role of non-governmental organisations, economic growth following Covid-19, sustainable energy, and recent increases in migration. The OSCE stands for lasting security in Eurasia through justice, problem-solving and development. The Parliamentary Assembly enables the strengthening of common values between the countries involved, particularly in times of international crisis. It is, therefore, a great privilege to be involved and to support this vial work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1>National Citizen Service visit:</h1>



<p>On the 8<sup>th</sup> July I met with a&nbsp;group of young people from the National Citizen Service (NCS) in Alfreton. The National Citizen Service is a voluntary program for 15–17 year-olds offering real world experience as well as opportunities for personal development. The program normally runs in the summer and consists of a week staying away from home working on social action projects that benefit the community. It is a great way for young people to make new friends and accomplish something to be proud of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a real pleasure to meet the NCS group in Alfreton and hear about their projects that are actively improving local communities, and to discuss a range of interesting questions they’d prepared. The group had been organising a fund-raising event at the Miners Arms to raise money for Ashgate Hospice, which turned out to be a brilliant success.</p>



<p>If you would like to learn more about NCS and how to get involved, <a href="https://wearencs.com/">click here.</a></p>



<h1>Summer survey &amp; visits:</h1>



<p>Recess is a break during the Parliamentary calendar in which neither the House of Commons nor the House of Lords sits. It allows time for MPs to focus on their constituencies away from Westminster. The House of Commons rose this year on the 21<sup>st</sup> July and will return on the 5<sup>th</sup> of September, also the date in which we will learn the winner of the Conservative leadership contest and the next Prime Minister.</p>



<p>Over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;out and about in Amber Valley delivering my annual summer survey. The purpose of this survey is to get your views on some of the biggest issues facing our constituency and the nation. This helps inform my decisions on how best to represent you in Westminster, and which local issues my team and I should focus on in our area. If you see me out and about, please feel free to come and have a chat, even if it is not about politics. If you’d like to do the summer survey online, you can also&nbsp; complete it <a href="https://nigelmillsmp.com/residents-survey-2022/">here.</a></p>



<p>In addition to delivering surveys, I have also been using my time in recess so far to visit local farms and industry. On the 25<sup>th</sup> July I visited Crowfields Farm in Langley Mill where, among other things, we discussed food security, sustainable food production and the volatile markets created by the energy price spikes and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<h1>Other local news &#8211; <em>and don&#8217;t forget to vote for Shipley Country Park!</em></h1>



<p>Historic England has announced a grant of nearly £10,000 for MSDS Heritage to realise a project which will explore the old working-class communities and cottage industry that once existed within Holbrook. The project is called ‘Holbrook’s Hidden Heritage’ and will involve archaeologists working with local schools and volunteers to create workshops, events, web content, open days, and pop-up events.</p>



<p>Holbrook in 1845 contained 54 stocking-frame workshops, with 152 stocking frames operated by workers with materials supplied by the mills at Milford and Belper. Learning more about our past can inspire pride and a sense of community in the present, so I hope this project gets the attention it deserves.</p>



<p>In other local news, as some of you will have seen from my social media, Shipley County Park has been nominated for Fields in Trust UK’s Favourite Parks award 2022. Voting is now open to decide the nations favourite park and will close at noon on the 18th August. If a park finishes within the top 20% of votes, it will receive recognition as a ‘Local Favourite’. The four Home Nation winners will then be shortlisted before the UK’s favourite park is announced.</p>



<p>Shipley Country Park is an exceptionally valuable local space. And when local parks have acted as a sanctuary for so many over the past few years, now is our chance to celebrate the spaces where we could get outdoors, move, relax, and meet with loved ones.</p>



<p>Please show your support by voting online before Thursday 18th August: <a href="http://www.fieldsintrust.org/favourite-parks/nominations">www.fieldsintrust.org/favourite-parks/nominations</a></p>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Preet Kaur Gill MP joined with pupils at St Paul's School for Girls to take part in online activities with children in Nigeria in the run up to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Preet and the children linked up with Bomas Academy in Jos, Nigeria, and exchanged information about their families, school life and favour subjects. </p>
<p>Steve Frew, who took gold in the 2002 games and 400m champion Lesley Owusu also joined them at the school for a morning of sporting activities. The event was part of Commonwealth Connections - a partnership between the British Council and the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. It involves 60 primary, secondary, and special schools in the West Midlands linking up with 60 schools across 10 Commonwealth countries. Through the partnership, children explore cultures and beliefs and learn how to communicate with people from different backgrounds and perspectives through sports and arts.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said: “Our wonderful city of Birmingham is one of the most diverse in the world and truly reflects the Commonwealth. It’s fantastic to see Commonwealth Connections promoting collaboration and encouraging young people to make new connections with people from different backgrounds and different countries. </p>
<p>“The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 affect us all and it’s vital young people, as future leaders, understand why these are so important. By talking to people across the world with different perspectives of how climate change and sustainability is impacting people’s lives is how we show how global Britain can be a force for good.” </p>
<p>During the event, St Paul’s School for Girls was presented with a British Council foundation level <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/accreditation/international-school-award/about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International School Award</a> by the organisation’s Senior Schools Consultant, John Rolfe MBE. The award champions schools that have shown a commitment to embedding international awareness and understanding in their classrooms and curriculums. The £500k Commonwealth Connections project is co-funded by Birmingham 2022 and the British Council.  </p>
<p>The British Council is delivering the project with Birmingham Education Partnership (BEP) and the children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust (YST). BEP has nominated its flagship Birmingham Arts School to lead on delivery of the arts and culture strand of the project. </p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”</span></p>

              <h3>Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
