<p>I had a fascinating start to my week with a roundtable on rebooting tech skills with the Fabian Society and Microsoft UK. We saw during the pandemic how the digital divide widened for young people living in low-income families. Tech skills are now vital for most careers and opportunities will be lost for many bright and innovative young people if they are not given the change to develop those skills. The world of work is practically unrecognisable to the one that our parents would have entered and the skills that are young people learn have to keep up with the new demands. </p>
<p>I was pleased to speak on the issue of a National Eye Strategy in Westminster Hall this week. For those living with sight loss from birth, and as many others find out, sight loss later on in life can be devastating. It affects work, how we travel through the world and how we interact with those around us. There is not only the physical impact, but the effect on our mental health, and on confidence, which is crucial for how we live our life. The Royal National Institute for the Blind estimates that there are more than 2 million people living with sight loss in the UK. Shockingly, at least half of that sight loss might be avoidable. Those who have treatment for sight loss and eye conditions often find it transformative and life-enhancing; however, people with sight loss are waiting too long for that vital treatment, with more than 24,000 ophthalmology patients waiting over a year for treatment in 2022. The Government must step up and put in place to help patients access treatment and eye units recruit and retain staff and to put in place measures to ensure that preventative measures are well supported.</p>
<p>I had a great time at Compass Point Primary today. It’s Share a Story week and I was able to read two of my favourites: Reckless Ruby and Giraffes Can&#8217;t Dance. Reading stories to children is so important. It’s important for their education, of course, but it’s also important for their socialisation and their imaginations. Reading with a parent or loved one is a shared moment of pleasure, it’s a feeling of safety and being loved, and it’s about more than just listening. Children are able to let their minds create these wonderful worlds that authors start building for them. It’s a skill we should teach them early and never let it be destroyed. </p>
<p>This week also saw the release of new unemployment figures. They showed a 6% increase in total unemployment and 8% increase in youth unemployment. I’m deeply concerned by the rapid increase in the number of people in Bristol South who are currently out of work. Every number in this statistical release is a person, a household, a family who are now struggling to make ends meet because they are without the dignity of work. We all know that the cost of living crisis was created in Downing Street. Ever since the Tories disastrous Budget under Liz Truss we have been forced to live with higher mortgage rates, stagnating economic growth and a government that spends more time fighting amongst itself than fixing the problems we face.</p>

<p><strong><em>Article written by Gill Plimmer and originally published in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www-ft-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/2723bd15-7c41-4593-9021-8a07e328cb09" target="_blank">The Financial Times</a></em></strong></p>



<p>Shareholders in water and energy monopolies should receive steady but unspectacular returns, says government adviser</p>



<p>Britain’s water and energy watchdogs should be empowered to crack down on companies “ripping off” consumers and “causing harm to the economy”, a key government adviser has said. </p>



<p>John Penrose, the UK “competition tsar” who is advising the government on reforming the regulators, said that a new competition bill will tackle modern monopolies such as Google but is yet to address the regulation of water and energy utilities. </p>



<p>“Our economic regulation system isn’t working properly,” Penrose told the Financial Times, referring to Ofwat, which oversees water and sewage companies in England and Wales, and Ofgem, the energy regulator. </p>



<p>“It has been too soft, giving monopoly-owning firms an overly easy ride on prices and quality with suppliers and customers paying the price for this failure.” </p>



<p>Penrose’s comments follow research by the FT that showed the 10 largest privatised water monopolies paid out £1.4bn in dividends in the year to March 31 2022 despite concerns over the dumping of unknown quantities of untreated sewage and storm water into beaches, rivers and lakes. </p>



<p>“Water is the stuff of life and none of us can do without it, but the performance of our long-term regulatory model is looking poor,” Penrose said. “The regulated utilities should be delivering good quality standards while receiving a steady but unspectacular return in the process. </p>



<p>“Instead we are seeing that shareholders earn monopoly profits that are both very high and extremely stable too, which means customers are getting ripped off by paying too much.” He added: “This is causing harm to the economy.” </p>



<p>Penrose, chair of the Conservative Policy Forum, a grassroots-led think-tank, was appointed in 2020 by then chancellor and current prime minister Rishi Sunak to review UK laws intended to promote competition. </p>



<p>The digital markets, competition and consumers bill has its second reading in the House of Commons on Wednesday and is designed to give the watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, greater powers. </p>



<p>Penrose acknowledged there were calls from across the political spectrum to renationalise the water and energy sectors. A YouGov poll last year found 58 per cent of Conservative voters believed water should be brought under public control and 47 per cent for energy. </p>



<p>However, Penrose said: “More competition is the quickest way to reduce the costs which are ultimately passed on to customer bills.” </p>



<p>The business water market was opened to competition by the government and water regulator Ofwat in 2017 in an attempt to mimic the energy sector, which had liberalised services in the 1990s. </p>



<p>Independent retailers were licensed to handle customer complaints, bills, meter readings and enquiries anywhere in the country, although the water is still provided by the regional water company. But a huge surge in complaints over service cast doubt over the market’s success. </p>



<p>The opposition Labour party has called for a new regulator merging parts of Ofwat, the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water inspectorate but Penrose said: “Moving the deck chairs doesn’t fix the underlying problem.” </p>



<p>Cat Hobbs, director of We Own It, which campaigns for public ownership of water, rail and energy, said: “The attempts by regulators to mimic the market have clearly failed and water should be returned to state hands as is the norm worldwide.”</p>



<p>Ofwat said: “We agree that water company performance needs to improve and we are acting to drive that change. We have trebled our enforcement capacity, to help us hold companies to account.” </p>

<p>Some regulars to this site and a few of my constituents are raising the issue of excess deaths. Over the last year according to official statistics these have been higher than normal. Some want to know if the covid vaccines have anything to do with this. The NHS medical establishment makes clear they do not think so and continue to recommend the vaccines as safe.</p>
<p>The latest excess death figures show above normal levels of death from cardiovascular causes, and sharply higher from liver disease. The overall excess death numbers are well below the covid peak prior to general vaccination.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if the NHS could provide a medical explanation of the trend in excess deaths over the last year, with any recommendations they might have to bring it back down. Meanwhile others without medical training will speculate, with worries about delays and missing treatments amongst the issues they raise.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Friends,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hope this email finds everyone well. Many of you will be aware that Tyneside Cinema is facing some serious financial difficulties at present. I’m getting in touch to share some information about a fundraising campaign we are launching, and to ask for your help as we try to rescue the cinema from closure.  </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/lovetynesidecinema">https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/lovetynesidecinema</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>We face a substantial hole in our budget for this year due to spiralling costs, the loss of core Arts Council funding, and a national decline in audiences for independent cinema since the pandemic. If we can’t make up the shortfall, it’s very likely that Tyneside Cinema will close in the next few months. But we have a plan to rescue the cinema that we think is achievable, and your support can play a crucial part in this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There have been changes here at the venue over the past few weeks. I’m sad to say that the cinema has had to make some unavoidable redundancies, as well as scaling back on operations through reduced opening hours and other changes to how we work. </strong></p>
<p><strong>On a more positive note, we are making good progress with securing additional funding for this year, which should take us two thirds of the way towards ensuring the future of the cinema.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A vital part of the plan to rescue the Tyneside is a public fundraising campaign. We need to raise £150,000 over the next six months and would really appreciate anything you can do to help us spread the word. If you might consider <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/FTjfCE835C3KRp7AHNLGkE?domain=justgiving.com">donating</a> that would also be enormously appreciated, and you can of course help us by buying tickets to films, eating in our bar café, or becoming a member of the cinema if you aren’t already. For those of you who are active on social media, or work for organisations that might help promote our campaign, I’ve included some copy for this below and attached some visual assets. With your help we are confident that we can reach our target and remain open.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are also talking to various supporters of the cinema and celebrity names about potential fundraising events throughout the year. If you might be interested in working with us on some of this activity or have any suggestions, do please get in touch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks as ever for your valuable support for the Tyneside. We hope to see you soon,</strong></p>
<p><strong>With all best wishes, </strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew and the Tyneside Cinema Team   </strong></p>

<p><em>This <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/23526859.gps-hospital-dental-services-chaos---bradford-mp/" target="_blank">column first appeared in the Telegraph &amp; Argus</a> on Weds 17 May 2023</em></p>



<p>Just a few weeks ago, the country celebrated the Coronation of King Charles III. It was an event that reflected changing times, bringing together different communities from across the nation and Commonwealth, and representatives of all faiths and none. But the real spirit of the coronation weekend wasn’t in Westminster Abbey, nor on the balcony at Buckingham palace, it was in the people who came together to support each other and celebrate together.</p>



<p>All across Bradford and the country, in every neighbourhood, residents held street parties, and community and faith groups opened their doors for galas and garden parties. Those community connections were just as important as what was happening in London.</p>



<p>When Queen Elizabeth ascended to the throne seventy years ago, it was also a time of great change for the country. Just a decade earlier, renowned social reformer Sir William Beveridge argued that despite all the turmoil faced by Britain in the midst of the Second World War, it was time to create ‘freedom from want’ across British society. With passion and vision, he put forward a revolutionary idea that now sits at the core of British identity – our National Health Service, which a Labour government put in place in 1948.</p>



<p>Almost eight decades have passed, and the UK is again facing challenging times at home and abroad. Following more than a decade of Conservative austerity, and now with an unprecedented cost of living crisis, families from all backgrounds are struggling to pay bills, put food on the table, and access the healthcare services they need.</p>



<p>We have all faced the struggle of getting a GP appointment – on hold at 8am in the hope we can secure a desperately needed appointment. In thirteen years of Conservative government, hundreds of pharmacies have closed, and 2,000 GPs have been cut.</p>



<p>And while pharmacies can deal with many of the most common issues, lack of access to GP appointments forces people to wait until their symptoms become severe. GPs themselves are now under-resourced to meet the needs of their patients.</p>



<p>The bottom line is that we need more doctors and nurses so that patients come first. Whether it’s a face-to-face appointment or over the phone, this needs to be a patient-led choice. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, NHS Dentistry fares no better. A shocking 98% of dental practices in Bradford do not accept new NHS patients, and 80% of dentists in England are not taking on new child NHS patients. This situation is a rotten expression of a government that has run out of energy and ideas..</p>



<p>Despite cross-party support for reforming NHS dentistry being clear throughout a debate I recently led in Parliament, the government continues to bury its head in the sand. When I challenged the Prime Minister on the matter, he dismissed my concerns out of hand, ignoring the lived experience of the 6 million people who tried and failed to get a dental appointment last year.</p>



<p>With the system so obviously broken, and the Conservative government so clearly out-of-touch, what could a future Labour government do to restore NHS dentistry?</p>



<p>A founding principle of the NHS was a shift from people only seeking treatment when the pain is unbearable, to a service with regular check-ups to spot problems early. The answer, as true in 2023 as it was in the early reign of Queen Elizabeth II, is that NHS dentistry must be based on prevention.</p>



<p>Investment must be targeted towards the areas that need it most, like Bradford. By making dental care a priority at all levels of healthcare, dentists would be better positioned to help treat the causes, not the symptoms, of dental decay.</p>



<p>We could also resurrect NHS School dentistry. In 2022, tooth decay was the single most common reason for hospital admission of children between the ages of 6 and 10. By integrating dental care into schools, we can protect our children’s teeth before any serious damage occurs.</p>



<p>This Conservative government repeats well-rehearsed lines about ‘sensible’ finances. It is now plain to see that Conservative mismanagement has left our GP, hospital, and dental services in chaos.</p>



<p>But we know doing it right can make all the difference. In my own Bradford South constituency in 2017, I worked with the Telegraph &amp; Argus and Government ministers on a ‘Stop-the-Rot’ campaign that reinvested £250,000 into local dental services over three years. With this targeted lump sum, 3,000 new NHS dental appointments were made available to people right across my constituency.</p>



<p>We have already proved that targeted investment is possible. This will be the sensible future option for this country’s finances.</p>



<p>The solutions to these crises exist. The country is crying out for a government willing to enact the necessary changes.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p><em>Martin spoke in the Backbench Business Debate on access to psilocybin treatments. Here is an extract of his speech transcribed via </em><em><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-05-18/debates/9A361D27-2DD4-4918-8EB7-3516C946BB9B/details#contribution-7096B105-5A02-4C8C-AFB1-46364D4960E5"><em>Hansard</em></a>:</em></p>



<p><strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes MP (SNP, West Dunbartonshire): </strong>It is a pleasure to speak in the debate today and to follow the hon. Member for Devizes (Danny Kruger) on a subject about which I have to admit I had no great prior knowledge. I had some knowledge, although not great prior knowledge, so getting my nose into briefings and articles about a most poorly understood topic, at least I think for Members in this House, and hearing the various contributions today has been most enlightening.</p>



<p>I will come on to those contributions in a moment, but I would like to pay tribute to my good friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (Ronnie Cowan), who is a co-sponsor of today’s debate. He is certainly a fan of the road less travelled, and I find the tenacity and good humour with which he approaches the sometimes unfashionable subject of drug reform—not only in this Chamber, but at home in Scotland—to be a breath of fresh air. As we know, the subject can often be too dominated, especially in this place, by preening truism pedlars who do not challenge either elected Members or the general public, who expect us to be able to have debates of substance on topics that, as the hon. Member for Devizes indicated, have no easy answers, but are none the less valuable.</p>



<p>I thank the hon. Member for Reigate (Crispin Blunt) and especially the hon. Member for Warrington North (Charlotte Nichols) for showing that there is cross-party support in this House for a sensible evidence-based approach to drug law reform. To come first to the hon. Member for Warrington North, who talked about the prior debate on access to nature, we live in these islands surrounded by psilocybin. Importantly, the hon. Member brought in the lived experience of their condition and how this research, or rescheduling to schedule 2 would have a profound impact on those suffering from PTSD. I hope not only that the Minister is listening, but that all of us on the Front Benches are listening, as well as those who advise Ministers in Government in Whitehall. I am sure Government Ministers will be taking their advice and I hope they are listening to the lived experience so well and eloquently expressed by the hon. Member.</p>



<p>The hon. Member for Reigate exposed something that all politicians, especially those on the Front Benches, need to be very careful about, which is proposing White Papers that talk about an evidence-based policy-making approach. Well, the evidence seems to be self-evident. My good friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde, talked about how the regulation we have is based on a preconception. I am maybe going to call it the “Mary Whitehouse approach”, because it seems to be founded on the Mary Whitehouse approach of the 1950s. I hope that those who advise Ministers—from the medical profession, but notably civil servants in Whitehall—will reflect that we now perhaps need to take our heads out of the sand.</p>



<p>I think it is clear from the contributions in general today that something does need to change with regard to the drug scheduling laws, particularly as they relate to psilocybin. It is a strange time for drug reform in many ways. We in this place seem a good decade, if not&nbsp;even further, behind the attitudes of the wider public—and, actually, other countries—who appreciate that the days of endless and expanding prohibition must surely be behind us and that the so-called war on drugs has been in so many ways not only unwinnable, but actually detrimental to the society it seeks to protect. I think all of us on the Front Benches really need to take our heads out of the sand and look at the opportunities that debates such as this now offer us to change our own views.</p>



<p>My party is one that I hope will always support sensible drug policies that uphold the rule of law and make communities safer. I am afraid that I now need to perhaps challenge the Minister about the UK Government’s continued reticence, for example, to even countenance an evidence-based change to drug laws, which, at least from my perspective, means letting people down. For those of us in Scotland, we have seen this in, for example, the safe consumption rooms. It is a policy with proven efficacy across the western world that enjoyed cross-party support as one possible way to reduce the terrible toll of drug deaths in many of our constituencies, yet I am afraid this was reduced to the level of party politics.</p>



<p>I mention the Government’s attitude to opiates there deliberately, because in many ways psychedelic drugs are more restricted, as we have already heard from various Members, with opiates being licensed for medical and research use, while substances such as psilocybin remain on the schedule 1 list with no medical potential. So this makes it an issue of pretty unique importance. I can understand arguments against, for example, safe consumption rooms, even if I disagree with them, but when it comes to psychedelic compounds, I do not think anyone can have the same arguments regarding addiction and societal breakdown that we would have heard around opiates.</p>



<p>Members who want a crash course in opiate addiction need only pick up the&nbsp;<em>Financial Times&nbsp;</em>today to see the profound consequences of opiate addition in the city of San Francisco in the United States. It is a harrowing article to read, and will have consequences for us all if we do not start to pick up on some of the issues highlighted by the hon. Member for Reigate about accessing new medical treatments. That is not, as the hon. Member for Devizes indicated, a silver bullet, but it is another tool in the armoury for those suffering from various conditions.</p>



<p>This is not just for mental health issues; there are a whole range of usages, and people are using psilocybin, or even micro-dosing with it, for many other issues. There are those who consider using it for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is not a mental health issue but a learning disability. There are those using it who are pre-menopausal, menopausal and post-menopausal, to deal with the menopause. We have to take this out of certain silos and see it as the broadest opportunity. As the hon. Member for Devizes said, this is not a silver bullet but another element in our armour to deal with a whole range of medical conditions. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say, because I am not sure that that approach is yet cutting through, although I might yet get that wrong.</p>



<p>As we have heard from those contributing to the debate, there are certainly enough examples of the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy to merit further research, but the barriers put up by schedule 1 status make any investment in that research prohibitively&nbsp;expensive. SNP Members believe that needs to change. We talk about the shrinking number of industries—again, the hon. Member for Reigate made a fantastic speech to challenge the Government, and they made it very clear that the UK seeks to be a global player. After financial services, the example given is the pharmaceutical industry, yet in that area of relative competitive advantage the Government seem—I might be wrong; perhaps the Minister wants to get to his feet and change that opinion—to be choosing to cede to states, notably in North America and the rest of Europe, that do not share that head-in-the-sand approach.</p>



<p>At a time when it is becoming somewhat fashionable for Members to talk about the mental health crisis, catching up with the lived experience of so many in communities such as mine, and those described by the hon. Member for Warrington North, where people could take advantage of advances in psychiatric pharmacology to improve their lives, those of their families, and be better able to contribute to their community, is something I would recommend to Members across the House, to Ministers, and to those who seem to be advising them to stick their heads in the sand. To overcome such problems, we must rise to the challenge and grasp the opportunity offered by psilocybin and other areas like it, and not curtail what is a reasonable scientific proposal by sticking our political heads in the sand.</p>



<p>Let me conclude with a final appeal to the better judgment of the Minister and those advising him. They can be safe that they would be able to proceed with a solid trifecta of public support, a solid working hypothesis about how research into psilocybin would work, and a depth of industrial and academic capacity to bring this research forward. Let us see whether the Minister has the confidence to do so.</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has marked Dementia Action Week and called for more to be done to tackle slow regional variations in dementia diagnosis.</p>
<p>Dementia Action Week is an annual initiative which runs from the 15 &#8211; 21 May. Each year, Alzheimer&#8217;s Society works with individuals and organisations across the UK to encourage people to act on dementia.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Gwynne met with Alzheimer&#8217;s Society representatives in Parliament to discuss issues facing dementia care, both locally and across the country. Statistics show that someone develops dementia every three minutes, but just 63% of people with dementia receive a diagnosis.</p>
<p>In Denton and Reddish, the dementia diagnosis rate is currently just above 68%, above the national target. Gwynne has welcomed the data, but stated that &#8216;there is always more work to do&#8217; in ensuring people receive a timely and accurate diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud to be supporting Dementia Action Week. It&#8217;s so important that we not only raise awareness of dementia, but continue to emphasise the importance of early diagnosis and high-quality treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were some really positive figures on dementia diagnoses in Dent</p>
<p>on and Reddish. While there is always more work to do, it&#8217;s positive that we&#8217;re ahead of the curve on this locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to get involved with the excellent work that Alzheimer&#8217;s Society are doing right across the country, do <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk">visit their website</a>. We all need to work together to improve dementia care for everyone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>James White, Head of National Influencing at Azheimer&#8217;s Society, added: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“We thank Andrew Gwynne MP for meeting with us, and showing his support this Dementia Action Week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The dementia diagnosis rate fell below the national ambition during the pandemic, and it has remained stagnant around 62% ever since. More than 30,000 people have missed out on a diagnosis, and therefore access to help and support, during this period. &#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe it’s better to know – 9 in 10 people told us they benefitted from getting a diagnosis as it meant they could access treatment and advice and plan for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Government needs to take urgent action to level up the diagnosis rate across the country, and ensure that people with dementia are not slipping through the net.”</p></blockquote>

            <div class="panel-body">
<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, Drew Hendry, has welcomed reassurances from Scottish Government Minister Graeme Dey about the priority given to young people in the development of the Highland region.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following a recent discussion with the Minister for Higher and Further Education about the ongoing concerns about the lack of security around the DYW funding in the region, Mr Hendry expressed his gratitude for the Minister&#8217;s reassurances that the Scottish Government remains steadfastly committed to investing in the futures of young people across the region.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the discussion, Minister for Higher and Further Education Graeme Dey highlighted the importance of the Developing the Young Workforce (DYW) scheme in this commitment. He confirmed that the Government would continue working closely with Developing Young Workforce Inverness and Central Highlands (DYWICH) to create a sustainable working model that enables young people to thrive long-term.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Hendry commented,</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am heartened by the Minister&#8217;s reassurances that the Scottish Government recognises the importance of the Developing Young Workforce Programme in the Highlands and is committed to working with partners to ensure that our young people are given every opportunity to succeed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Scottish Government has a long track record of investing in young people and has already confirmed that £4.2 billion will be spent on education and skills in Scotland in 2023/24, nearly £100m more than last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Highland region has unique economic and workforce challenges, which I know the Minister recognises, and he is keen to work with industry leaders to address.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By placing young people at the heart of our development, we can create a vibrant, skilled workforce that will drive our regional economy and contribute to Scotland&#8217;s overall economic health.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As the MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey, I will continue to work with the Scottish Government and DYWICH to ensure that the region&#8217;s young people have access to the opportunities they deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The discussions between Mr Dey and Mr Hendry followed communications from Mr Hendry and regional leaders, highlighting the challenges faced by DYWICH following the recent announcement that their funding model was changed from a twelve-month commitment to a six-month commitment.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>This week in Parliament, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron met with Bruce Parker, Head of Planning &amp; Development, North West at National Highways, to ask for vital safety improvements to be delivered on the A590.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Tim pushed for progress on plans to introduce speed cameras and lower speed limits on those sections of the road which has been plagued with accidents throughout recent years.</p>
<p>Tim also pressed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The carriageway to be widened to enable safe turning at Newby Bridge garage</li>
<li>A foot and cycle bridge at the junction by Haverthwaite Railway Station</li>
<li>A roundabout at the junction by Gilpin Bridge near Levens</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Department for Transport from 2015 to 2019, there were eight fatalities, 14 serious accidents and 58 slight accidents on the A590.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"The A590 is an absolutely crucial link between Barrow, Kendal and the M6.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Tragically though it has become an accident blackspot, with numerous incidents of people sadly losing their lives.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I want to pay enormous tribute to the tireless campaigning from local residents, local parish councils, and local councillor Sue Sanderson who have been banging the drum to make this road safer for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"It's vital there is no delay, and that the proposed work is done urgently to prevent more lives tragically being lost."</em>

<p>For decades now, our planning system hasn’t been delivering the housing we need, in the places we need it, for the people who need it. For too long, the system appears to have been driven by the national volume house builders who too often make their money from land banking and high density commuter housing estates on the edge of existing developments – rather than through a proper planning system run to deliver for the people who need planning to work for them, instead of being done TO them.</p>

<p>I’ve long been concerned by the amount of development coming to areas like our own in rural Mid Norfolk – which is often inappropriate, “industrial” in scale and unsustainable. While most of our villages can take and are indeed up for (when properly asked) taking some additional new housing (without which our communities will gradually fade away), I fundamentally believe that more needs to be done to give local communities a greater say in how they develop in the years to come (with greater protections), which is why I have been so vocal in my opposition to the way so many large national developers abuse and take advantage of the planning system to dump such inappropriate and unsustainable developments on our towns and villages.<br />
 <br />
That’s why, through <strong><em>The Norfolk Way</em></strong> project I set up before I became an MP, I have been so vocal in advocating for a better model of growth and development that places greater emphasis on delivering small pockets of housing of the type and aesthetic desired by local communities, and in the places they earmark. I truly believe the spirit of Localism enshrined in the 2011 Localism Act should be enhanced, with the Act itself strengthened to remove some of the loopholes we’ve seen exploited. (To read more about my views in full, please visit my ‘Planning and Protecting Our Rural Heritage and Landscape’ campaign page <a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/planning-and-protecting-our-rural-landscape-and-heritage">here</a>) I was delighted to see the NPPF reformed in the autumn by Michael Gove to give more power to local planners.</p>

<p>I continue to make the case I have long made that the right way to plan housing is to give local councils, democratically accountable to the local residents they serve, the freedoms and incentives to plan properly for the right sort of housing and growth where it is needed ie:</p>

<ul><li>around hotspots of economic growth</li>
	<li>on brownfield sites in areas needing regeneration</li>
	<li>around growth towns with the infrastructure and services available to sustain further growth</li>
	<li>in villages with a Neighbourhood Plan setting out the amount of housing they are happy/able to take and which ensures affordable & appropriate local housing for local workers and residents</li>
</ul><p>That’s what the <strong>Breckland</strong> and <strong>South Norfolk Council</strong> Local Plans rightly aim to do. What we don’t need in rural Norfolk is massive commuter estate “New Towns” dumped in the middle of rural mud Norfolk without proper infrastructure, facilities, sustainable transport links or fit with the existing pattern of development.</p>

<p><strong>The North Elmham New Town</strong></p>

<p>The North Elmham New Town would also represent massive development of the precious River Wensum chalk stream habitats (not to mention a Site of Specific Scientific Interest).</p>

<p>That’s why I was delighted to chair a meeting on Friday in North Elmham with local parish councils and local councillors Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge to make clear that the idea of a new town in the area will NOT be supported by ourselves as elected local  representatives.</p>

<p>Bill and Gordon confirmed that Breckland Council are NOT zoning this area for major housebuilding, and will oppose a re-application of the New Town as we did successfully last time it was proposed.</p></div>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><strong>New Towns and Garden Villages </strong></p>

<p>Whilst there are places in the UK where there may be a strong case for a new generation of garden towns and villages, with all of the necessary infrastructure and transport links (either to drive regeneration as in parts of the post-industrial North, or to alleviate the pressure around major growth hits spots like Cambridge), North Elmham is not a sustainable location.</p>

<p>I can think of several possible sites in East Anglia that could perhaps take such a garden town or village: specifically the dilapidated station sites on the Cambridge-Ely-Brandon-Thetford-Attleborough-Wymondham-Norwich railway line – as part of the Oxford-Cambridge East-West Railway Development Company I have championed over the years, and especially during my time as Minister for the Future of Transport at the DfT.<br />
 <br />
However, I’ve also been very clear that, for any such development, we need to be sure that:</p>

<ol><li>Any such developments must avoid the loss of ancient woodland and high quality farmland</li>
	<li>We see a serious commitment to Net Zero and building into the plans a higher quality, cleaner, greener standard of life – not continuing to same old, lazy model of house dumping that sees thousands of additional vehicles tearing through old country lanes and causing more congestion and rat-running</li>
	<li>There is serious investment into public and private infrastructure – with proper road, rail, cycle and walking routes</li>
	<li>Any such development is planned appropriately and sustainably, and that it makes sense in the wider community context.</li>
</ol><p> <br />
I have not seen any evidence to suggest that a garden town or village would be appropriate in this part of Mid Norfolk, and given the rural and inaccessible nature of North Elmham and the surrounding villages, the already serious congestion on the nearby road network and the nationally significant environmental and habitat importance of the Wensum Valley, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which this idea could be taken seriously.</p>

<p>To my mind, it would make far more sense for such a significant level of growth to be focussed down closer to the A11 Corridor – which Breckland Council themselves have, rightly, recognised is the key growth artery in our region and have tried to focus the bulk of the district’s future growth. I know the Leader of Breckland Council, Cllr Sam Chapman-Allen, and both Cllr Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge strongly support this.</p></div>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>At the meeting we agreed some important Next Steps:</p>

<ul><li>To reconvene a meeting of ALL the parish councils in the affected area after the forthcoming local elections on May 4th to make sure all write to Breckland Council formally to express their concerns.</li>
	<li>Bill and Gordon and I will liaise to ensure all the local residents who object have their objections properly acknowledged by BDC.</li>
	<li>I will invite my neighbouring MP, Jerome Mayhew, to join that follow-up meeting given a number of his Broadland communities are in close proximity to the site around North Elmham and would also be affected.</li>
	<li>I will write to Michael Gove (Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) and the Minister for Housing to make clear why any New Towns and Garden Villages should only be  delivered in the right locations with the associated connectivity, infrastructure and services required) and not in inappropriate locations with the obvious environmental, sustainability and transport issues this scale of development would inevitably threaten.</li>

<p>When it comes to attracting visitors to Llanelli, we have a lot to shout about and be proud of.</p>



<p>There are so
many places of interest and things to see.&nbsp;
We need to use every opportunity to tell people what’s going on here and
why they should come and see it for themselves.</p>



<p>This week is
Welsh Tourism Week 2023, a chance to do exactly that.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Tourism is a
vital part of our economy and something we should develop further to create
more jobs, more income and a more sustainable future for our communities.</p>



<p>Llanelli is the
gateway to West Wales.&nbsp; We have a rich
cultural, sporting and industrial history and host some stunning urban and
rural landscapes.&nbsp;&nbsp; A stronger tourism
sector, supplemented by innovative marketing of what we have to offer, could
provide the basis for further expansion.</p>



<p>The Millennium
Coastal Path is one such feature that so many outside of our town do not know
about. The 13-mile path, linking Llanelli to Pembrey Country Park, gives access
to Llanelli beach, views over Gower and is a great way for visitors to get to
know the area better whilst grabbing a coffee or ice cream along the way.</p>



<p>Llanelly House
in the town centre, a restored early 18<sup>th</sup> Century Georgian
townhouse, with its educational tours and popular bistro, is another landmark.</p>



<p>Add things like
Parc Howard, independent craft shops, Parc Y Scarlets, the world famous
Llanelli Wetlands Centre and so much else besides and we have the potential to
make so much more of what we have.</p>



<p>We can all
spread the word to others, by word of mouth, social media or other means.&nbsp; It’s amazing what we might be able to achieve
with a little more self-confidence, greater co-ordination and a bit of good old-
fashioned ambition.</p>

<p><strong>Grant Shapps, the local MP for Welwyn Hatfield, visited Peartree Primary School in his constituency and met with staff and students.<br><br></strong>During his visit, Mr Shapps caught up with the staff of Peartree and learnt all about their plans for transformation over the next few years.

The members of the school council are aged between five and eleven and are elected by their classmates to give them a voice in Peartree School’s vision, projects and events.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Mr Shapps commented on his visit and on his time with members of the school council:<br><br>“It was a pleasure to catch up with staff and visit pupils at Peartree School last week. The children are clearly enjoying their time there very much, and it was really helpful to get an insight from Miss Hardy and her team as to how everyone’s getting on. Plus, I enjoyed a brilliant sit-down with the School Council &#8211; they really put me through my paces with their questions.”<br><br>Megan Hardy, the Head of School at Peartree, thanked Mr Shapps for visiting and meeting with the staff and students:<br><br>“It was a pleasure to show Mr Shapps around Peartree and to talk to him about our plans for the school’s transformation over the coming years.”<br><br>She continued:<br><br>“The children were really excited to meet their MP and they came up with plenty of interesting questions to ask him. They were very inspired by his visit, so we may even have a future prime minister among us!”&nbsp;<br><br>Mr Shapps thanks Peartree for having him visit and wishes the staff and students all the best for the future.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>

<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684233937.JPG" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Choice at the End of Life, so I attended the <a href="https://www.mydeath-mydecision.org.uk/">My Death My Decision</a> (MDMD) campaign for Assisted Dying event held in the Pierhead Building in Cardiff Bay, hosted by Jayne Bryant MS for Newport West and James Evans MS for Brecon and Radnorshire. MDMD believe that assisted dying is a Welsh Issue because health care is devolved and the Senedd can legislate on matters such as palliative care, which is intrinsically linked to assisted dying. 93% of the public in Wales support assisted dying.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under s2 of the Suicide Act 1961, assisting or encouraging a suicide is a criminal offence in England and Wales. In February 2022, a Welsh resident was arrested, interrogated by police, detained for 19 hours, and subjected to a 6-month investigation for accompanying Sharon Johnston, a tetraplegic from Cardigan, to have an assisted death in Switzerland. The investigation was dropped but it cost Dyfed Powys police force over £7,000 in overtime and IT.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The BMA survey found that 59% of doctors favoured legalising a right to die for those terminally ill and those who are incurably suffering, and 88% of the public favour this too. It is supported by The Royal Colleges of Physicians, Medicine, Nursing and Psychiatrists, and 96% of 140 UK disability rights organisations do not oppose reform. Limiting the option of assisted death only to those with 6 months left to live would be discriminatory because people with incurable conditions do not suffer less than terminally ill, and they deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect. Austria, Canada, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and other countries have already legislated for assisted dying for both the terminally ill and the incurably suffering.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">90% of the public in UK want a law to allow adults of sound mind who are terminally ill and suffering intolerably from an incurable condition the option of a peaceful, painless, and dignified death. The UK Assisted Dying Coalition found that more than one person a week who is terminally ill or incurably suffering is now forced to end their life abroad. But many cannot afford the £10,000 costs of travelling abroad. The right to die should not be limited to those with means.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of <a href="https://www.unitetheunion.org/what-we-do/unite-in-your-region/wales/">Unite the Union</a> I was honoured to be a part of the Unite Wales Women’s Network Launch of its “<a href="https://www.unitetheunion.org/campaigns/get-me-home-safely-campaign/">Get Me Home Safely (GMHS)</a>” campaign which was held in the Unite Building in Cardiff. The event was organised by my dear friend, Unite Wales Equalities Officer Jo Galazka and chaired by the Women’s Network chair Caroline Price. Speakers included Alison Spencer-Scragg, Unite National Women’s Officer, who extolled the benefits of getting involved in the Network and the priorities for Unite women. Irina Do Carmo, Unite Researcher and GMHS Lead, spoke about the success of the campaign, which was launched online in the UK in March 2022, and is now an international campaign. I took part in the online launch in March 2022 when we heard from Caitlin Lee, who was sexually assaulted walking home from work after a late Friday night shift working for a multinational hotel in Glasgow. Her employer denied that it had a duty of care towards Caitlin, and wouldn’t help her, so Caitlin and young Unite activists started the GMHS campaign. Caitlin is Unite Glasgow Hospitality branch chair, and she said that many workers in the hospitality industry are forced to choose between affording a week’s shopping or getting a taxi home, even if taxis were available. The GMHS campaign has 8 demands which include: a legislative change to extend an employer’s duty of care to cover a worker’s transport; free transport home for staff as a condition of granting a liquor licence; mandatory training for bus operators on gender-based violence; municipal ownership of buses to improve the shortage of night buses; and a national minimum standard for taxis and private hire. The GMHS campaign has secured support from Abellio in London, National Express in West Midlands, and the European Transport Federation, made up of pan-European trade unions, unanimously adopted it and will roll it out in all its nations. I am delighted that the campaign is now a global campaign and I am committed to help it become a success in Wales. The campaign will encourage employers in Wales to provide safe, free transport for its workers who finish their shifts late at night or in the early hours of the morning in the hospitality and tourism industries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The inspirational Unite Welsh Women’s Officer, Jos Andrews, delivered an interactive learning session on “Getting Your Voice Heard” where all the many women at the meeting worked together in roleplaying exercises, which were very enjoyable, and we all got to know each other really well in a short space of time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sue Da’Casto, Unite Wales Learning Fund Officer, led a session on learning and development opportunities through the Women’s Network specifically through the Wales Union Learning Fund (WULF). Unite in Wales is present in over 2,000 workplaces across all sectors and has over 75,000 members. WULF is a Welsh Government funded programme that has a 20 year legacy. It is designed to encourage wider participation in lifelong learning, support bespoke workplace training, provide a best practice approach to essential skills such as literacy and numeracy, and remove barriers for vulnerable workers. WULF works in partnership with union networks, employers, statutory organisations, stakeholders, training providers and FE/HE partners to help future proof Welsh workplaces and support Unite members. Unite Skills Academy provides 12 different online and accessible training courses which include administrative and secretarial, IT, conflict resolution and social prescribing.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended St David’s Church Service on 7th May to celebrate the coronation of King Charles III in Westminster Abbey on 6th May. Our Rector Lynda prayed that the King has the strength to serve our worldwide family of nations, the courage to defend the Faith in word and deed, and the grace to care for his people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to support the annual <a href="https://aslef.org.uk/about/political-work">ASLEF Parliamentary reception</a> in Westminster and met its Leader Mick Whelan, of whom I am a great admirer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://hopenothate.org.uk/">Hope not Hate</a> drop-in event in Westminster was about the rise of far-right anti-migrant activism. The MPs and Peers that attended heard that Hope not Hate research has shown that far-right activity around asylum accommodation has increased by at least 102% in 2022 from the previous year, with 253 separate incidents, which included – creating shared content online, leafleting and demonstrating, turning up at asylum accommodation to protest, harassing residents, filming content to boost their online profiles and encouraging anti-migrant activism. The far-right has attempted to generate outrage by drawing on a range of tropes, such as, disgust at the “luxury” accommodation given to “foreigners” compared with UK homeless people, particularly veterans, opposition of using taxpayers’ money during a cost-of-living crisis, and fear for the safety of women and children due to the “invasion” of young men. Some protests and opposition groups are being organised by the far-right locally. In Llantwit, local residents were upset that a site was going to be a new healthcare centre, and potentially become temporary housing for asylum seekers. The Patriotic Alternative, Britain’s most active fascist group, began leafleting in the Llantwit area to inflame local opposition, using the healthcare centre as a Trojan Horse for their extreme ideology.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was proud to be elected as a vice-chair of the <a href="https://www.appglgbt.org/">APPG Global LGBT and Rights</a> at its AGM, after being a member for many years. Dame Angela Eagle MP and Elliot Colburn MP were re-elected as co-chairs, and I look forward to working to improve the well-being of the LGBT community in countries around the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a supporter of the <a href="https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/">Dogs Trust</a> for many years, and I was delighted to attend its drop-in to highlight the illegal import of puppies. In 2021, the UK Government made a commitment to tackle puppy smuggling via the proposed Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, including reducing the number of puppies that can enter the UK under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-pet-to-great-britain">Pet Travel Scheme (PETS)</a>, but the UK Government has not made available parliamentary time to progress this Bill. Whilst we wait, PETS continues to be abused by smugglers who find new ways to avoid detection to illegally import pregnant dogs and puppies who are often underage, unvaccinated, and in poor welfare condition. Since relaxation of PETS in 2012, Dogs Trust has cared for over 2256 illegally imported puppies, if sold to unsuspecting members of the public, would have made over £3 million for illegal importers. Over 75 dogs have had their ears cropped, despite it being an illegal procedure in the UK and EU. The UK Government should make parliamentary time available to debate and progress this Bill as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Rail in Wales, I was very grateful that the Speaker granted me a 90-minute <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-05-10/debates/53E458C4-E5AD-4B01-9F4E-8CFA8534ED13/RailInfrastructureWales">Westminster Hall debate on Rail Infrastructure in Wales</a>. I opened the debate speaking about the history of my passion for trains, which started when I was about three years of age and suffered terribly with travel sickness every time that my mother took me on a bus journey. We didn’t have a car, so my mother tried taking me on a train, and I loved it and I wasn’t travel sick. I spoke about my dream that one day the freight lines in my Neath constituency would become available for passenger travel again. And I paid tribute to Banwen’s famous historian George Brinley Evans, who shared my dream and that he had long advocated reopening the passenger line from Swansea to Brecon. We all miss Uncle George who sadly passed away last year at the age of 96. I miss his friendship, advice, and long stories about his life. I emphasised how important railways are to the UK and Wales, but the lack of funding from the UK Government has resulted in the very poor state of many tracks, stations, and signalling systems, which desperately need repair and replacement. The fragmented nature of the rail sector in Wales leads to lack of coordination and accountability – the UK Government via Network Rail own it – Transport for Wales and other rail companies operate services. Despite these challenges, the Welsh Labour Government has made significant investments. The South Wales Metro is being built, a plan for the Swansea Metro is under way, and the North Wales Main Line upgrade will improve connectivity between Crewe and Holyhead, increasing capacity and shortening journey times. I praised the Welsh Labour Government for leading on the <a href="https://www.gcre.wales/">Global Centre of Rail Excellence</a> (GCRE) being developed in my Neath Constituency, which will be the UK’s first net zero testing facility, and will include a campus for rail innovation, R&amp;D, testing and verification, training, and train storage. By coincidence, on the morning of the debate, the GCRE announced that it had signed a deal with Transport for Wales for TfW to use all GCRE facilities, which follows a recent agreement with Hitachi. Great news. I spoke at length about the disappointment that HS2 will not bring benefits to Wales, and I suggested ways in which the rail infrastructure may become fit for purpose in the future. I concluded by thanking the MPs that spoke in the debate for their excellent contributions and for their unanimous support for every aspect of my speech. And I invited the UK Government Rail Minister, Huw Meriman MP; Shadow Minister, Tan Dhesi MP; all MPs in the debate, and the chair Judith Cummins MP for Bradford South, to visit the GCRE.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported Holly Lynch MP and Greg Smith MP at their Westminster event with the Directors of the proposed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gratitudegames/?hl=en">Gratitude Games</a>, co-founders Mike Downard and Simon Rider. The games will be multi-sport, with over 20,000 competitors from 17 emergency service organisations, and the NHS, across 20 sports. The games will highlight and raise funds to help treat the profound mental health challenges and consequent poor mental health experienced by the UK responders. The plan is to stage the games in 2024, but it needs UK Government financial support to establish the games, and create a sustainable long-term funding infrastructure to support ongoing mental health. We listened to Sam Rider and Mike Downard make the case for the games, and from representatives from the emergency services including: Benjamin Pearson, who has retired because of mental health issues from serving as a police officer with West Yorkshire Police, and has since strived to make a difference as to the way people see and deal with mental health issues in the workplace; Ricky Nuttall, serving firefighter with London Brigade for 18 years, and one of the 250 first responders at Grenfell Tower on 14th June 2017, has suffered from PTSD as a result of the life-changing decisions he made that night, and now is an advocate for raising awareness of social and workplace mental health. I was one of the MPs and Peers at the meeting who signed individual letters to the UK Government asking for funding to be allocated for the establishment of the Gratitude Games.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to attend a meeting to support Anna Firth MP for Southend West, who will be having the first reading of her 10-Minute Rule Bill in the chamber on 23rd May which will criminalise fatal dog-on-dog attacks and hold irresponsible dog owners to account. The Bill will be informally called <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1768222/anna-firth-dog-on-dog-attacks-specific-criminal-offence">Emilie’s Law</a> after the late partner of Anna’s constituent Michael Joannou, whose dog Millie was fatally injured when attacked by another dog in 2021. Under current law, dog owners are not liable for any prosecution following an attack by their dog on another dog unless the injured dog is an assistance or service dog, or a human being is injured in the attack. Between 2016 and 2021, there was a 700% increase in dog-on-dog attacks from 1700 to 11559. I will be in the chamber on 23rd May to support Anna’s Bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a member and vice-chair, I attended the AGMs for both the APPG on Legal Aid, chaired by Karen Buck MP, followed by the APPG for Pro Bono and Public Legal Education, chaired by Laura Farris MP, meeting to formally reconstitute the APPGs before dissolving them. Both APPGs will, in the next few weeks, merge to form a new APPG on “Access to Justice”. Karen and Laura will become co-chairs and I agreed to become a vice-chair of the new APPG. It was great to catch up with Baron Willy Bach who chaired the Bach Commission which was founded at the end of 2015 with 13 commissioners, who held evidence sessions to identify key areas of LASPO that severely restricted legal aid access to justice. I was Willie’s vice chair and took over as chair when Willie became the PCC for Leicester in May 2016. The Fabian Society acted as secretariat to the Commission and the final report can be read <a href="https://fabians.org.uk/about-us/our-projects/previous-projects/the-bach-commission/#:~:text=The%20Fabian%20Society%20provided%20the,fundamental%20and%20enforceable%20public%20entitlement.">here</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a long-time vice chair of the APPG on Acquired Brain Injury, chaired by Sir Chris Bryant MP, I attended a reception in the Jubilee Room off Westminster Hall to talk about better support for those with a brain injury and the strategy which continues to be worked on with officials from the Department for Health and Social Care. The event was so well attended by constituents with brain injuries eager to meet their MPs that the Jubilee Room was packed and there were queues extending into Westminster Hall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An old friend Rob Palmizi, who now works as Policy and Public Affairs Manager for the <a href="https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/in-your-area/wales">National Lottery Heritage Fund in Wales</a>, invited me to attend their Young People, Skills and the Future of the Heritage Sector at Westminster. The National Heritage Lottery Fund is the largest dedicated funder of heritage, and has invested over £8.2 billion in more than 45,000 projects since 1994. The event showcased two projects: the New to Nature programme supporting more than 70 full-time temporary work placements in nature and landscape organisations across the UK aiming to increase diversity and enrich the environmental sector, delivered through partnerships with Groundwork, The Prince’s Trust, Disability Rights UK, and Mission Diverse; and the Kick the Dust programme, which was named by young people with an aspiration to stir up heritage. 12 grants of between £5000 and £1 million have been allocated to projects across the UK that will involve more young people and where they can enjoy, learn and lead heritage-based activities in their communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected a vice chair at the AGM of the APPG for Sport, and we discussed suggestions for Parliamentary events to raise the profile of sport across the recreation sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I ended the week by watching the very brave Sue Andrews, Neath MA Reader and President of Churches Together, who had her <a href="https://twitter.com/StDavidsNeath/status/1657340264229289984?cxt=HHwWgIC2lY-Mh4AuAAAA">head shaved to raise money</a> for Christian Aid Week in St David’s Church.</p>

<p>Nottingham Labour is celebrating retaining all 50 of the seats that they have held for the last four years at the local elections on 4 May 2023. In addition to this Labour gained a seat from the Conservatives in Clifton West. There are now no Conservatives on the Council for the first time. The people of Nottingham have recognised that Labour remains the best party to lead this city moving forward and have endorsed their manifesto with an overwhelming mandate earlier today.<br></p>



<p>This evening Nottingham Labour group has re-elected Cllr David Mellen as Leader of Nottingham City Council, while Cllr Audra Wynter has been elected as Deputy Leader.<br></p>



<p>While the past four years have not always been easy, under the strong leadership of Cllr Mellen, Cllr Adele Williams and Cllr Sally Longford, Nottingham City Council has continued on its journey of improvement while maintaining the services that matter most. Cllr Williams has held the portfolio for Finance for the last year and led the delivery of a four-year balanced budget earlier this year.<br></p>



<p>While Cllr Wynter is newly elected as deputy, she has previously served on the executive for the last year as Portfolio Holder for Highways, Transport and Parks. She was previously Chair of the Audit committee. Cllr Wynter has also led and supported social housing providers in building affordable homes and more temporary accommodations for the homeless. She has served the people of Bestwood Ward for 4 years and was re-elected earlier today.<br></p>



<p>Nottingham Labour has great plans for the city, and under this new mandate Nottingham Labour will seek to deliver on the five key promises made at the election as well as the pledges in the full manifesto.<br>Following the election victory and his own re-election Cllr Mellen said:<br></p>



<p>“By once again voting for the Labour Party, the people of Nottingham have told us that they want a council that can deliver on jobs and houses, cut anti-social behaviour and clean up your neighbourhoods. Nottingham Labour has a strong track record in this, and we will continue this record.<br></p>



<p>“We know this won’t be easy. We face ongoing financial challenges – from both the lack of investment from the Government, but also as we continue to recover from the pandemic. Our council is also currently on a journey of improvement – but I believe this will require us to be even more innovative and even more creative in the way we make changes for the better.<br></p>



<p>“We know the people who live in Nottingham have so much potential and we believe we can unlock that potential with an active, well-run City Council that supports and develops people, encourages growth and investment and provides people with security through essential public services. I am honoured to once again, have been given the responsibility of leading the council and will work with Cllr Wynter and those elected in the coming days as Portfolio Holders and all councillors elected today to repay the trust given to us by Nottingham People.”</p>

<p>I visited Kings Heath Boys School last week which has just had a fine Ofsted report reflecting real progress achieved under four years of the current Head’s leadership.</p>



<p>It’s only by providing good schools that we can equip our children and grandchildren for the future. There’s always been a link between poor areas and school success. Labour understands this. In the 60s and 70s the Wilson government created Educational Priority Areas and after 18 years of Tory rule, the last Labour government introduced Education Action Zones to once again boost the chances of children from poorer backgrounds.</p>



<p>It’s by working with parents and carers and putting schools at the centre of communities that we build the solid foundations from which children succeed. Over 13 years of Tory rule, we’ve seen teachers abused and experts ridiculed and an attempt to return schools to teaching models experienced by too many government ministers, in private schools, over the past 50 years. It’s not structures like free schools or academisation or gimmicks about a smattering of Latin that matter. We need support for parents and programmes to attract the best teachers to disadvantaged areas.</p>



<p>Almost every successful person has a story about the teacher who influenced their direction and put them on a path to success. We need to rediscover an ambition and love for education.</p>



<p>At Kings Heath Boys they’re not planning to rest on their laurels but open up choice and opportunity by changing to an intake of boys and girls. We’re blessed with several outstanding schools in south Birmingham, they do a remarkable job despite squeezed budgets, teacher retention problems and children’s mental health issues. These are all things the government should be addressing.</p>



<p>I hope the local community will get behind plans for Kings Heath Boys which will give more children a chance to attend a school that’s best for them. I’m hungry for a Labour government that treats teachers with the respect they deserve and puts our children first.</p>



<p>It’s time to focus on a system where the talents of every child can be nurtured and where their achievements are the priority.</p>

<p>As he hadn&#8217;t commissioned this company in the first place, he demanded to see the application form, which was such a poor forgery that both his and his wife&#8217;s signature were clearly in the same handwriting.</p>



<p>With the government repeatedly warning the public not to fall for financial scams, it&#8217;s incredible that the HMRC fell for this one.</p>



<p>So can we have a Treasury statement, so we can understand the extent of this problem, what&#8217;s being done to prevent it in the future, and when constituents like mine will actually get their money from the HMRC.</p>



<p><strong>Government response</strong>:<br>Well, I thank the Honourable Lady for raising this case. I&#8217;m very sorry to hear that. </p>



<p>She may of course wish to raise it at Treasury questions on the 9th of May.</p>



<p>But given this is a sizable chunk of money for them to be out of pocket with, I will certainly raise this today with HMRC and ask them to contact the Honourable Lady with regard to this case.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>The cross party Work and Pensions Select Committee responsible for scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) policies, has published a damning report on the Government’s health assessments system which is used to screen whether sick and disabled people should have access to vital social security payments.</p>
<p>These payments provide financial support to a working age person who is unable to work because of their health condition or disability; the assessment for this is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and is for either Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work. In addition there is also the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment process to access support to cover the extra costs disabled people face because of their disability which are estimated at over £580 a month on average; this is for the Personal Independence Payment.</p>
<p>The report exposed the detrimental impact of the assessment process itself on the health and well being of claimants.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the Committee, Professor Ben Barr, from the University of Liverpool, was asked about research he carried out in 2015 which looked at the impacts of the WCA as claimants were reassessed to move onto Employment Support Allowance. His analysis estimated that across England, the WCA had caused an additional 600 suicides, 300,000 additional cases of mental health problems and a large rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over a nine-year period.</p>
<p>&#8220;We looked at whether it could be explained by other factors or other economic trends, but there was quite a unique pattern in the increase in mental health problems, and the most likely explanation was that it was due to the reassessment process&#8221;, he told the committee. He said it is difficult to assess improvements since this study as &#8220;there are no systems in place&#8221; to monitor the impact of the health assessments and the potential adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>A survey by the University of Kent last year found half of claimants who have been through the WCA process said it made their mental health worse. Dr Ben Baumberg Geiger, who led the research, told the committee: &#8220;It is not sufficient to say that this is a historical problem and that everything is fine now. If there was more transparency, it would be easier to know a bit more about it, but the evidence suggests that there are still major problems with the WCA that could lead to an increased risk of poor mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth and a Member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee said:</p>
<p><em>“The evidence is clear &#8211; the current system is not fit for purpose. The DWP’s own figures show that <strong><u>274 people a month</u></strong> <strong><u>die 6 months after being found fit for work </u></strong>and <strong><u>60 people a month die 3 months after having PIP refused. </u></strong>These are poorly people not the shirkers and scroungers that some Conservatives refer to when discussing social security claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“We heard evidence during the inquiry that when people were being reassessed between 2010 and 2013, there were 600 additional suicides. In 2020, National Audit Office has said that the claimant deaths that the DWP had investigated were the tip of the iceberg. The current approach is contributing, directly and indirectly, to the physical and mental health harm of claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“Last year the Equality Watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, issued a Section 23 order against the Department of Work and Pensions over their discriminatory treatment of disabled claimants.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Government itself has effectively acknowledged a different approach is needed when they announced that they would abolition the Work Capability Assessments, something I have been calling for years, but the detail of the future process is too opaque and doesn’t provide reassurance. Given it will take place several years to replace, what happens until then?</em></p>
<p><em>“I remain deeply concerned about these health assessments but also about the punitive nature of the sanctions regime, introduced in 2012 and, once again, on the rise. </em></p>
<p><em>“I believe it is these social security policies, as well as the inadequacy of the social security support especially for working age people, and the dehumanising culture that claimants too often experience that collectively contribute to the adverse health effects is the It is so detrimental to vulnerable people especially, but to all people as well.</em></p>
<p><em>“Given the failure of the Government to make many of the changes recommended in our predecessor Committee in 2018, I hold little hope in them taking on board the improvements set out in the report.”</em></p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update on a few local matters.</p>
<p>First of all, for those of you intending to vote in the local elections in May, a reminder if you did not know, that you will need to take photo ID with you to the polling station. This is part of a new approach to avoid people impersonating someone else by voting in their name.</p>
<p>There are details on Council websites for Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead and what to do if you do not have a suitable form of ID.</p>

<h2>Stoneleigh Railway Crossing</h2>
<p>For those of you living in the Stoneleigh area, work is due to start soon on the new step free crossing over the railway at the station. I hope this will make things much easier for people with mobility issues, not to mention small children in buggies or heavy shopping bags.</p>
<p>This is a timetable for the planned work.</p>

<h2>One Day Travel Cards</h2>
<p>Transport for London has just announced that it is planning to scrap paper one day travelcards from outside London, which is likely to affect many people in our area. I will be lodging an objection to this, particularly as it is happening at the same time as the proposed ULEZ. If you want to find out more, they have published details at</p>

<p>Although the feedback form on this site is pretty limited, I would encourage you to share any opinions about the proposal via the link.</p>
<h2>Veterans Group</h2>
<p>In the last bulletin I gave you details of the support for veterans in Epsom and Ewell. I have been asked to remind those living in Mole Valley about the veterans hub for those living in the district, which is also providing valuable support locally. You can find out all the details at</p>

<p>The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking after the visit <strong>Matt Warman MP commented</strong> ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith</strong> who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’</p>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world&#8217;s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<br />
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.<br />
<br />
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.<br />
<br />
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.<br />
<br />
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.<br />
<br />
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.<br />
<br />
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.<br />
<br />
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.<br />
<br />
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.<br />
<br />
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.<br />
<br />
We have a historic debt of honour to them.<br />

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography.

Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br />
<br />
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br />
<br />
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br />
<br />
Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br />
<br />
<i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br />
<br />
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br />
<br />
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br />
<br />
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br />
