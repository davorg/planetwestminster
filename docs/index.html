<p>The poor UK GDP figures for 2020 are  not comparable with many other countries. As I explained on 12 August on this site, the UK statisticians reported a large fall in health output with the big drop off in non CV 19 work, and a big fall in education output with the closure of schools from the second quarter of the year. Other countries with large state sectors in education and health report the cost rather than the output, so they do not show any decline in these large areas of activity.</p>
<p>I agree with the UK statisticians that GDP should be based on output. It is a pity other countries do not use the same basis. If we included all the UK spending instead of output in the state sector then the UK had a relatively good GDP performance last year compared to other European countries.</p>

<p>This afternoon, local MP Tim Farron has written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak urging him to use next month's Budget to extend financial support to local businesses.</p>
<p>It comes as new figures from the Treasury reveal that Tim's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency has the highest proportion of people on furlough anywhere in the country, with almost one in four workers currently signed up to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</p>
<p>In his letter to Mr Sunak, Tim asked for the furlough scheme, which is set to end in April, to be extended as well as a 12-month extension to the business rates holiday and the cut in VAT which both finish in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tim also made fresh calls for the Government to finally offer support to the almost 3 million people nationwide who have been excluded from the financial support schemes.</p>
<p>Writing to the Chancellor, Tim said: <em>"Here in the South Lakes, where we rely massively on the hospitality, arts, culture and tourism industries, one in four of workers are currently on furlough - the highest proportion of any Parliamentary constituency or local authority.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is set to end in just two months time with no sign that businesses will be able to reopen by then. Put simply, many of those businesses won't be able to afford to pay those wages and those workers will be sadly dumped on the dole.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Businesses need certainty. They need to know when they will be able to reopen and that they will have enough financial support to help them get back on their feet.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I understand that the question of when we restrictions can be lifted rests on some factors that are out of your control. Therefore that it makes even more important that businesses have the confidence that they will be supported in the months ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Having spent billions on keeping the economy afloat, it would be a complete dereliction of duty if you were to wind down this vital support and let those businesses go the wall when we are so close to the end of this crisis."</em>

<p>Back in 2018, the Department of Health was renamed as the Department of Health and Social Care. Like many people, I hoped that this was a sign of three things. Firstly, that the Government was finally going to treat social care – which has been in crisis for some years now – with the same importance as health, secondly that there would be more coordination between the health and social care systems, and thirdly that this meant that they had a plan for how to fix the crisis in social care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was disappointed therefore when no plan materialised under Theresa May. Boris Johnson then promised when he entered Downing Street “that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared”. Sounds great, but still no plan came. The Tories then promised a plan again in their successful 2019 General Election manifesto. It probably won’t surprise you at all to know that there is still no plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, they are floating new reforms to the NHS to undo the last set of reforms that they themselves made. It is welcome that they now admit that these reforms, carried out by Andrew Lansley when he was Health Secretary, aren’t working. However, it is also frustrating that they ignored the warnings from the Labour Party and others about the potential consequences when they were first raised about a decade ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important though, that some of the very positive work that has been done in recent years aren’t undone in this next set of reforms. In Tameside, we’ve seen a growth in integrated working that has delivered some fantastic results – this is something that we need to keep going forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then we come back again to social care. The Government still has no plan. To me, it seems pointless and counter-productive to push ahead with a plan for the NHS when social care still isn’t sorted. If we are going to have integration between the two systems (which is vital) then any grand plan that the Government has will have to cover both. To reform one without the other has the potential to store up huge problems for the future – and unfortunately it will be ordinary people who pay the price.</p>

<p>Last Saturday I was privileged to chair the “Increasing Diversity and Encouraging Candidates to Stand for Election” session at the virtual Wales Co-operative Party Conference. Chantal Lee, the new Co-operative Party Equality Officer gave an introduction to the Co-operative Party’s equalities project. Then we heard from the speaking panel. Each member reflected on suffering experiences of inequality in their lives, and how they have tried to overcome these personal, life changing, episodes. We heard from Jackie Jones, former Wales MEP and now Labour and Co-operative candidate for Preseli Pembs in the forthcoming Welsh Parliament elections. Ramesh Patel, chair of Welsh Labour BAME. Baroness Debbie Wilcox of Newport, the first woman to lead both Newport Council and the WLGA. And Philippa Thompson, who was the Labour candidate in the 2017 and 2019 General Elections, and is now the Labour and Co-operative Police and Crime Commissioner candidate for Dyfed Powys. It was a very moving, thought provoking, frank session, and if you would like to listen, please follow in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCelJrWTOTA">link</a>.</p>
<p>The week in Westminster began with the APPG for Hospitality and Tourism, with guest speaker, Kate Nichols CEO of UK Hospitality since 2018. Kate urged the UK Government to set out an exit strategy from the pandemic now, so that businesses can plan when they are allowed to reopen. The exit strategy should be a phased approach. Kate highlighted that so many small businesses had fallen through the gaps in support, provided by the UK Government, and made an appeal to the Chancellor to announce support for her industry in the forthcoming budget on 3rd March, including continuation of the reduced VAT rate, (from 20% to 5%), a 100% business rates holiday, and flexible furloughing. It was emphasised that these measures should last until 1st April 2022. Kate would also like tourism to be included in all UK Government Trade Deals.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I was re-elected as vice-chair of the All-Party Group for Alternative Dispute Resolution at its AGM. The APPG was formed in 2015 to bring together MPs and Peers with common interest in ADR and get it onto the political agenda. We seek to promote a harmonious society and help people avoid, manage and resolve conflict without resorting to court action. ADR is a vital component of any well-functioning judicial system, and includes arbitration, mediation and construction adjudication. We hold evidence sessions, panel discussions and inquiries, and I look forward to our programme of work in 2021.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, it was Safer Internet Day. Now, I cannot imagine how we would have coped this past year without the internet to keep in contact with friends and family, for our children to do their schoolwork, and for us all to have some access to the outside world while cooped up at home. However, we must not forget that the internet holds significant dangers, for adults as well as children and for those less versed in web safety. We’ve seen a rise in scam emails and messages relating to Covid-19 during the pandemic, and unfortunately, these scammers are becoming very adept at presenting information that looks true. The dangers for children are also extreme – children chatting online do not always think about the reality of who is speaking to them and may put themselves at risk without all the facts. Of course, we do not want to scare children into never using the internet, but we need to give them enough information, as we do about safety in the real world, to ensure that they are able to keep themselves safe. Just as children know not to talk to strangers in the street, they need to know not to talk to people on the internet they do not know or give out any personal information. It is vital that parents have these conversations with their children, especially now the internet is such an important part of our lives.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening I joined a public Zoom community conversation event organised by the South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael and Neath Port Talbot Council. We had a wide-ranging discussion about many topics including Covid-19 restrictions, online safety including an overview of local initiatives for Safer Internet Day, engagement with young people, domestic abuse, anti-social behaviour, neighbourhood watch, the future of policing, the precept and police funding. Neath representatives – Inspector Matt Otteson, Cllr Peter Rees, Cllr Dean Cawsey and Community Cllr Dai Davies joined the call.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I attended the Co-operative Parliamentary Group of MPs and Peers Zoom meeting to listen to representatives from our UK affiliate organisations tell us about the challenges of Covid-19 in the workplace. Shop worker abuse, high street business rates, food justice, food recycling, and the competition from online retail were mentioned by representatives from all over the UK. Co-operative stores have workers who are proud of the in-store service that they provide to customers day in day out and we should support them to do their jobs without fear of abuse.</p>
<p>Thursday was a day spent attending Zoom calls where Labour MPs discussed very important issues such as employment rights in the workplace, and the importance of trade union membership in representing workers, as illustrated by the campaign that GMB have organised against the incorrigible British Gas “fire and rehire” policy. Unite has also led a campaign for Heathrow Airport workers. In both cases, workers who have been loyal to these companies for many years have been offered new contracts on very inferior terms and conditions, on the threat of being sacked if they do not accept. The danger is, if one company gets away with this, then many more companies will try to do the same. I am very proud that our Welsh Labour Government has used important law-making powers to reverse the Tory UK Government’s damaging anti-trade union legislation. The Trade Union (Wales) Act overturns the pernicious and harmful laws that the Tories had introduced across the UK to dismantle the rights of public sector workers.</p>
<p>On Friday morning I attended our regular Swansea Bay University Health Board update Zoom call for MPs and MSs in the region. SBUHB will complete their programme to offer a vaccination to every person in the top four groups of the JCVI list by this weekend, due to the tremendous effort of NHS workers, GPs and volunteers working at Mass Vaccination Centres and GP practices throughout the region. They are following up those individuals who have missed their appointment and reaching out to those people, who have not attended, for whatever reason, to rearrange appointments and to make sure that those who have refused to be vaccinated can change their minds. Every week I take the opportunity to thank the incredible dedicated health and social care staff, emergency services and volunteers who are putting their lives on the line, every minute of every day, to help to keep us safe from this pandemic. Next week I am visiting the Mass Vaccination Centre in Margam to personally thank the staff who are administering vaccinations on behalf of SBUHB. Please follow the link to read the <a href="https://www.christinarees.org/swansea-bay-university-health-board-stakeholder-update-4/">SBUHB weekly newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>Friday lunchtime I joined the Zoom call update about the <a href="https://valleysregionalpark.wales/">Valleys Regional Park</a>. Former First Minister Carwyn Jones initiated this project in 2017, and a prospectus was produced the following year. Wales is the land of discovery and adventure. Thirteen local authorities, from Carmarthen to Pontypool, and from Bridgend to Merthyr, will be the “discovery gateways” to the Valleys Regional Park. Bridgend CBC is the host council, and the important elements are – our wonderful Welsh valleys landscape, reconnecting people with our valleys and improving the local economy. It’s about pride, identity, partnership, culture, recreation, well-being, social prescribing, tourism, innovation and enterprise, alongside scale, ambition, and structure. Cllr Anthony Hunt, Leader of Torfaen Council, emphasised that all levels of Government are working together to make sure this vision is realised over the next two years.</p>
<p>This week we had the fantastic news that free school meals have been guaranteed for all eligible children in Neath, up to and including Easter 2022, as the Welsh Labour Government have introduced the only national, government-funded programme to tackle holiday hunger anywhere in the UK. No child should ever go hungry and no child should ever have their life chances limited by something so simple as a decent meal. A good breakfast, lunch, and dinner are such simple things and taken for granted by most of us, but they are vital in ensuring that children are able to concentrate on their lessons which offer them the best chances in life. Hungry children are not happy children and children who are not happy are not able to learn properly, interact well with other children, or find inspiration for what makes them happy.

<p>Weston’s MP John Penrose is supporting proposals for a Great Western FreePort, based around Bristol docks, to drive growth and high-skilled job opportunities across Weston and nearby villages as well as the West Country as a whole. <br><br>John says: “The Great Western Freeport could be a key building block in levelling up Britain’s economy outside London and the southeast, and Weston is well set to make it work. We can build on Bristol docks’ success with our dynamic local firms and our increasingly high-skill workforce that’s fuelled by Weston College’s  South West Skills Campus, the Engineering Training Centre, Future Technology Centre, Food Works SW and business hubs like The Hive and The Stable.</p>



<p><br>In response to opposition to the freeport voiced by Liberal Democrat former general election candidate, Councillor Patrick Keating, John added: &#8220;These bids are hugely competitive. Lots of other places are competing against us, so we all need to unite behind it. Criticism and carping won’t help our chances. I hope that the LibDems in North Somerset Council’s leadership, who I’m pleased to say are supporting the bid, will distance themselves from these unhelpful comments and move swiftly to sort out this split in their party ranks.&#8221;</p>

<p>This week is National Apprenticeships Week, and I’m championing apprentices and employers across Barnsley and South Yorkshire who have a pivotal role to play in supporting our economic recovery and renewal in the aftermath of Covid. Here in South Yorkshire, we’ve got a plan to shape our future regional economy, focusing on making it better, as well as bigger, to serve our people and communities. Fully funded, our Renewal Action Plan (RAP) would create 55,000 job and training opportunities and 3,000 high-skilled apprenticeships – putting jobs at the heart of our Covid recovery.</p>

<div class="feed-description"><p>Stevenage is leading the way in the vaccination programme with a mass vaccination centre, 2 GP Surgeries, Lister Hospital and Chells Pharmacy all vaccinating local people. Stephen McPartland, Member of Parliament for Stevenage visited St Nicholas GP Surgery to see the vaccination programme in action.</p>
<p>Stephen McPartland MP, said “It was an incredibly uplifting experience. All of our GPs are working together and have identified two GP surgeries where they give the vaccinations. On my visit 1436 local people were done in just one day at the St Nicholas GP surgery. It is incredibly well organised, the patients are a little nervous on the way in, but quickly reassured, vaccinated and leave very relieved. They are inside for less than 2 minutes and the organisation is military like precision, while warm and friendly.</p>
<p>“The number vaccinated was staggering and is actually more than our mass vaccination centre does in a single day. I have now asked Ministers if our local GPs can take over running the mass vaccination centre too, as alongside the Lister Hospital, they have the experience, flexibility and desire to get to every single person in our community quickly. They are also out there making sure the housebound are vaccinated, so no one is left behind.</p>
<p>“I am so proud that Stevenage is leading the way with the vaccine roll out and huge thanks to all the staff involved at all our centres as their warmth and commitment makes a huge difference to the patients being vaccinated. I would also like to thank MECCA Bingo for the treats they organised for me to give to the vaccination team at St Nicholas - another wonderful example of our brilliant community spirit here in Stevenage.”</p>

	<p class="hs_Para">Last March, the Chancellor told councils that he would fund them to do “whatever it takes” to get communities through the pandemic. On the back of that promise, councils set to work correcting the Government’s failures on personal protective equipment distribution, contact tracing, shielding and much more, but the Government did not repay those costs. Instead, they left councils facing a £2.5 billion funding black hole. That is not my figure; it comes from the Conservative-led Local Government Association. If the Government had not broken their promises, there would be no need to plug the gap now with a council tax increase.</p>
<p class="hs_Para">Perhaps the Government could not find £2 billion to prevent a council tax rise because they had already stuffed the money into their friends’ pockets. Despite stark warnings from the National Audit Office last November,<strong> the Government have handed out £2 billion in crony contracts to companies with close personal links to senior Conservative party politicians.</strong></p>
<p class="hs_Para">More than 500 companies were fast-tracked for covid-related contracts simply because they had relationships with Conservative MPs.</p>
<p class="hs_Para">That made them 10 times more likely to secure contracts than other businesses that could well have done the job better.</p>
<p class="hs_Para">Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li class="hs_Para">The chairman of Clipper Logistics donated £725,000 to the Conservative party. He was rewarded with a £1.3 million contract to set up an Amazon-style PPE distribution network. Instead of the next-day delivery service that care workers were promised, they had to wait so long to receive any PPE at all that town halls had to pay to go out and find their own.</li>
<li class="hs_Para">Then there is Randox, which pays the Conservative right hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson) handsomely to act as an adviser. The Government gave Randox a contract worth half a billion pounds last year to provide covid tests, but they were so defective that 750,000 had to be recalled.</li>
<li class="hs_Para">Serco, of course, is responsible for the Prime Minister’s “world-beating” test and trace system, which is so world-beating that the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies described it last year as having only a “marginal impact” on reducing the spread of the virus. <strong>It never worked properly, but it cost £22 billion</strong>. Serco’s chief executive is the brother of a former Conservative MP and his wife has donated thousands of pounds to the Conservative party. The company counts among its former senior executives the current Minister for Health. The Government handed Serco a £108 million contract for a failing system that could have been run better by directors of public health for a fraction of the cost, and then Ministers rewarded that catastrophic failure with another £57 million contract for “management services support” at testing sites.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the behaviour we would expect in an advanced democracy such as our great country; it is the wilful incompetence and endemic cronyism that we would expect in a tinpot dictatorship.</p>

<p>SNP WARNS NHS ON THE TABLE IN FUTURE TRADE DEALS</p>
<p>The SNP has criticised the Tory government for shutting down Parliamentary scrutiny and railroading ahead with its damaging post-Brexit Trade Bill.</p>
<p>It comes after the UK government voted down measures which sought to give Parliament a role in future trade talks and to take the NHS off the negotiating table. It also blocked cross-party attempts to outlaw trade deals with countries found guilty of committing genocide.</p>
<p>Commenting after the vote in the House of Commons, the SNP&#8217;s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tory government has not covered itself in any glory with its shameful approach to its post-Brexit Trade Bill. At each turn it has taken every effort to shut out Parliament and dodge scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite all the rhetoric of protecting the NHS, the Tories rejected every attempt to take the NHS off the negotiating table. It has had plenty of opportunities to match its rhetoric with action &#8211; instead the Tory government has blocked measures that would have given Parliament a meaningful role.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the safeguard of Parliament &#8211; which was the last line of defence &#8211; having a role in trade negotiations and the mandate with which the government negotiates, the NHS will always be on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when so many have had cause to depend on the NHS &#8211; from its invaluable doctors, nurses and staff &#8211; the Tory government has refused to protect it from trade talks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, the government had a second opportunity to back measures to outlaw trade deals with countries guilty of committing genocide. Its attempts to block the amendment &#8211; despite opposition from its own backbenches &#8211; yet again highlights Boris Johnson&#8217;s post-Brexit race to the bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Trade Bill is damaging to its very core. The architects of the Leave campaign talked up taking back control from Brussels &#8211; yet they have taken another step in taking control from Parliament and the devolved nations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotland can do so much better. It&#8217;s clear that the only way to properly protect our interests and public services is to become an independent country and to regain the benefits of EU membership.&#8221;</p>

<p>MP for Beverley &amp; Holderness and founder of the CADEY campaign, Graham Stuart, is looking for the campaign’s lifesaving work to install more defibrillators to hit new highs in the New Year.</p>
<p>CADEY – which stands for Community Access Defibrillators for East Yorkshire – was founded in 2018 with the aim of covering every community in Beverley &amp; Holderness with a publicly accessible defibrillator, and also seeks to raise awareness of the importance of defibrillators and CPR.</p>
<p>Initially, just over 60 communities were identified as lacking a defibrillator by Graham and the Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) – a number which has now been cut by more than half thanks to the campaign’s efforts, by bringing the emergency services together with local charities and fundraisers to raise money for the lifesaving devices.</p>
<p>The local MP is hoping to get the number of communities without a defibrillator down even further in 2021 as Covid-19 restrictions are eased and the country begins to build back from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Roughly 30,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals every year, but currently only 3,000 people survive because of how important it is to get immediate, on-the-scene treatment. Every minute without treatment reduces someone’s chances of survival by approximately 10%.</p>
<p>No formal training is needed to perform CPR or to use defibrillators. Guidance from the Resuscitation Council UK advises that it remains important for people to provide emergency CPR after they have called 999, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, by performing chest compressions without any rescue breaths.</p>
<p>Graham said, “We’ve made great strides in covering my constituency with defibrillators, but the coronavirus crisis has understandably taken up a lot of our partners’ time given that they’re medical teams and charities.</p>
<p>“The vaccine rollout means we can start to think about restrictions easing soon, and I’m hopeful that this means we can continue installing defibs across Beverley &amp; Holderness with renewed vigour.</p>
<p>“We’re also planning to send postcards to local residents with info on where their local defibrillator is, and the postcards will also invite people to download the what3words app, which gives every 3-metre square in the world a unique combination of 3 words. YAS use this so they know exactly where to go on callouts as it can save vital seconds and minutes.</p>
<p>“I’m really looking forward to working with our partners to drum up more funding and interest in defibrillators so that we can achieve blanket coverage in Beverley &amp; Holderness.”</p>

<p>Isles SNP MP Angus MacNeil says criteria for the Seafood Disruption Support Scheme (SDSS)&nbsp; must be altered to ensure that parts of the sector do not miss out on vital funding.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has tabled questions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, to ask that the criteria and funding allocation for this scheme be looked at again and to ensure that the correct support is available.</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “The damage done to our seafood sector because of Boris Johnson’s Brexit Deal is being widely felt across Scotland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have great concerns that the UK Government’s Seafood Disruption Support Scheme does not go far enough to compensate the seafood sector for their financial losses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The scheme asks that the sector needs to prove verifiable financial losses, but this is not wide ranging enough criteria for those who have had to cancel orders, had customers cancel orders or have had to freeze product resulting in 80% less product value, as well as the groupage issues many have faced while exporting to market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The industry has also rightly expressed their disappointment in the narrow criteria for the scheme today. There has been no consultation with the industry about this scheme, it has simply been prescribed to them.”</p>



<p>The Chief Executive of Seafood Scotland, Donna Fordyce, earlier commented “We hoped the £23m would go some way to alleviating the pressure, while the existing problems could be resolved.&nbsp; However, the initial industry feedback today is one of disappointment, with many companies instantly realising they will be ineligible for support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She further stated “It’s probable that these companies will never be fully compensated for what they have lost and are still losing, but the damage could still be limited if the systems were workable and export gets back on track quickly.”</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil added “I am calling on the Chancellor to expand the criteria for this scheme, £23 million will not go far enough to account for the losses faced by the industry. It has been 40 days since the Tories disastrous Brexit came into play, the Scottish fishing industry estimate that Brexit is costing them over £1 million a day meaning that this scheme already needs to be greater and so I urge the Chancellor to top up this scheme.</p>



<p>“When the Chancellor set up this scheme it was so that people who were losing money would be able to access this fund. This should not be a labyrinth of bureaucracy to prevent those who have lost money from the Government&#8217;s Brexit deal, to not access that money, because of rules the Government have created. If we compare this to last January then people have lost money due to this carry on.</p>



<p>“The SDSS alone will not help solve the issues faced by the industry, but it is important that the scheme is done correctly and is wide ranging enough to compensate for the losses faced. The UK Government needs to work with the fishing sector to help alleviate the delays and issues from getting their perishable goods to market, as this is not just a one off disruption but rather an ongoing issue.”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Three and half years on from the Grenfell tragedy and residents are still facing huge uncertainty and colossal bills for repair work to their homes. </p>
<p>The announcement today comes too late for those first-time buyers who have already gone bust and this really characterises their approach to this crisis. Too narrow in scope and much too slow.</p>
<p>Upfront funding is absolutely essential to ensure that cladding remediation can start as soon as possible. However, in Birmingham, over 100 applications have so far been made to the Building Safety Fund and none of them are yet to receive any money or have any work undertaken. This is glacially slow. </p>
<p>Every week that leaseholders are left with dangerous cladding yet to be removed and the fear that comes with living in a flammable building, leaseholders are having to pay soaring insurance premiums as well as costly waking watch costs to just stay safe in their homes. </p>
<p>On top of all of this, the Government has announced an arbitrary 18 metre height limit for funding this work. Remediation works should be prioritised by risk. For example, in 2019, Richmond House, a building shorter than 18 metres burned down in nine minutes. No flats were saved. Because of the height of this building, it wouldn’t have been eligible for funding to make it safe and we need the Government to start learning lessons before more horrific events like this occur.</p>
<p>The urgency of this issue for leaseholders facing financial ruin does not magically disappear at the 18 metre mark. Leaseholders trapped in unsafe buildings below 18 metres still face soaring insurance premiums and can’t sell their homes until they’re fixed.</p>
<p>We welcome the funding the Government is putting forward but we need them to be realistic and protect leaseholders and taxpayers who haven’t caused the problem.</p>

<p>A month in and 2021 is proving hard going – fortunately there is also hope for the spring with the rollout of the vaccine.  The UK passed the terrible milestone of  100,000 deaths from  Covid19, a statistic that hides  immeasurable suffering, grief and loss.  Over the past few months we have cycled through tiers, lockdowns and bubbles at a confusing  rate, and now we are in our third lockdown the message to stay at home is clear and must be followed, but many are understandable daunted by the continuing restrictions, the short days and the impact of jobs and income.  I regularly meet  people who are unsure how they will make it through the next few months and business owners who have invested thousands of pounds of their own money to pay for staff furlough and covid security measures but now fear they will go under.</p>

<p><strong>Town Moor meeting with Showmen&#8217;s Guild</strong></p>
<p>We have seen a significant increase in demand for foodbanks and greater need for support. Coronavirus levels in the North East  rose steadily over and after Christmas, before falling back down. They are still at alarming levels, as is the pressure on the NHS. But the vaccine delivery in the North East is something we can all be proud of, and offers hope that better days are ahead.</p>
<p>The end of the Brexit transition period has had a severe impact on many Newcastle businesses exporting to the European Union, with additional bureaucracy and costs as well as confusion if not chaos at our ports.</p>
<h4>Backbench and Constituency Role</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Brexit transition period ended on 31<sup>st</sup> The Government secured a last minute bad deal and after some discussion, Labour chose to vote to implement the deal, given the alternative was a no deal exit which would cause untold damage to our economy.</li>
<li>Vaccine rollout began in Newcastle and in general has been highly successful.</li>
<li>My office continues to be based online whilst looking for ways to improve working practices to make it more effective. Attendance at online surgeries is steadily increasing.</li>
<li>Support for the most vulnerable in this lockdown has once again been lacking, whether with regard to free school meals, or appropriate devices and access to broadband for home learning. The inequalities impact of this pandemic will be with us for a long time.</li>

<p><strong>Online meeting with Toni&amp;Guy Hairdressers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding the rollout and regional data regarding COVID-19 vaccines, availability of testing data and resources to local authorities, challenging the digital divide, financial support for individuals and businesses facing ongoing COVID-19 disruption and restrictions in the North-East, forward planning for next summer’s exams, health and safety precautions for health and safety of Royal Mail staff and the Horizon scandal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Shadow Ministerial and PES Role</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Telecoms Security Bill, on which I am leading for Labour, had its second reading and Committee Stage. This is an important but quite technical bill requiring a huge amount of time from the team to provide briefings, draft amendments and speak to stakeholders</li>
<li>The Government continues to drag its feet with regard to online harms legislation. The Online Safety Bill as it is now to be called is not expected before the new Parliamentary session, probably in May. We continue to meet with many stakeholders and prepare the launch of our Report.</li>
<li>The National Security and Investment Bill  came back for its Report Stage and Third Reading. I spoke at Report Stage, advocating amendments to give guidance on national security, support small businesses and ensure proper parliamentary oversight. They were all rejected.</li>

<p>This week I participated in the Parliamentary debate on the UK Space Industry, secured by my colleague Owen Thomson MP.</p>



<p>During the debate, I highlighted the immense potential of Prestwick airport, in my constituency, to operate as a horizontal launch spaceport with its many advantages &#8211; a 3 km runway, clear weather, good transport links and Scotland’s largest aerospace campus next door.</p>



<p>I also spoke of the importance of having an overall space strategy to stimulate the whole sector and so the global research, innovation and manufacturing opportunities of this industry are not missed. </p>



<p>The biggest unresolved issue, however, which I have raised previously with the Government, is that companies must accept unlimited liability to indemnify the Government against third-party damage. Without a cap on liability it is impossible to get insurance and this is already driving some micro-satellite companies out of the UK to other countries.</p>



<p>Concern also exists at the lack of consultation on moving regulation from the UK Space Agency to the Civil Aviation Authority, especially as the latter has its hands full with taking on aviation safety after Brexit.</p>

<h3>Dr Philippa Whitford MP</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The value of the UK space industry has more than trebled since 2010 and impacts on our daily lives, including the TV we watch, GPS navigation in our cars, and the covid apps on our mobile phones. While these services are delivered by large equatorial satellites, the UK would be likely to specialise in launching small, low-orbit satellites that are used for Earth observation, such as weather patterns, signs of climate damage or tracking shipping.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Scotland is a major player, with almost a fifth of UK space sector employees. Glasgow is the leading producer of micro-satellites, while Strathclyde, Glasgow and Edinburgh universities have innovative research departments. Scottish companies, such as Skyrora and Orbex, are already developing commercial launch vehicles and both have produced low-carbon fuels to minimise their climate impact. Scotland also hosts five of the seven potential spaceports, including Prestwick airport in my constituency. Prestwick already has many advantages as a horizontal launch spaceport, with a 3 km runway, clear weather, good transport links and Scotland’s largest aerospace campus.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The UK space industry is currently held back by the lack of a domestic launch site, but the licensing and regulation system of the Space Industry Act 2018 is still not finalised. The industry is concerned about the technology safeguarding agreement with the US, which could exclude foreign-launched customers from UK spaceports. It would be a failure if they just ended up as long strips of tarmac awaiting the occasional visit of a US vehicle.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The biggest unresolved issue is that companies must accept unlimited liability to indemnify the Government against third-party damage. This is disproportionate, as small satellites would largely burn up on re-entry. Without a cap on liability, though, it is impossible to get insurance, and this is already driving some micro-satellite companies out of the UK. There is also concern at the lack of consultation on moving regulation from the UK Space Agency to the Civil Aviation Authority, especially as the latter has its hands full with taking on aviation safety after Brexit.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It is critical that spaceports stimulate the whole sector, with a boost to research, innovation and manufacturing, and that they inspire more young people to go into the sector. The most important requirement is an overall space strategy so that the opportunities of this global industry are not missed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Today I announced that Labour would push for the legal right for care home visits to take place. The ban on care home visits has been a scandal, and taken a terrible toll on families and residents.</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">Tens of thousands of care home residents have been unable to receive visits from their families for almost a year. The Government introduced limited visiting introduced late last year, but scrapped it when the second wave hit.</p>
<p>We need to recognise the anguish that separation has caused families, as well as the role that family members play in providing care, supporting residents mental and physical health.&nbsp;This is true not only for care home residents with dementia, but also for working age adults with physical and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>I first wrote to Matt Hancock urging for visits to resume back in June. We now need urgent action to reunite families, and make it a legal right to visit.</p>

Every so often it is worth commenting on dogs that haven’t barked, or in this case events that have not happened. I am referring to the traffic chaos many of us feared on Kent’s motorways in the early weeks of Brexit.
With a few small bumps along the way, the process has been much smoother than it…

<p>Almost four years after the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, around 7,099 people in Bristol are still living in flats with flammable cladding.  Dangerous cladding renders flats unsellable, leaving many families affected unable to sell their homes and enduring months of lockdown in unsafe homes.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, pressed Minister for Housing, Christopher Pincher MP, to respond to a proposal by a cross-party Parliamentary group for a bond scheme to help pay for remedial works.</p>
<p>In Parliament, Pincher suggested that developers, investors and building owners should be responsible for paying the cost of cladding removal and other work related to building safety only if they “have the means” to do so.</p>
<p>Both Labour and Conservative MPs, including Karin, opposed the suggestion that leaseholders should be made to take out loans in order to pay for repair costs.</p>
<p>On Monday, Karin Smyth MP voted for a Labour motion in Parliament calling on the Government to urgently establish the extent of dangerous cladding provide up-front funding to ensure cladding remediation can start immediately. However, Conservative MPs failed to show up for the vote when the division was called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</strong></p>
<p>“It has been almost four years since Grenfell, yet only a handful of buildings in Bristol have had the urgent repairs needed to make them safe.  Lives have been put on hold as dangerous cladding renders flats unsellable, trapping thousands of people in unsafe homes.</p>
<p>“Recent statements made by the Housing Minister in Parliament were very concerning in suggesting leaseholders may have to shoulder the burden of paying for repairs.  I recently heard extremely worrying stories from constituents in Bedminster who are being asked to pay thousands of pounds in remediation bills that they cannot afford. It is essential that leaseholders should not be expected to pay bills to rectify problems with original construction.</p>
<p>“This has gone on for too long.  Every day that passes puts thousands of people at risk in Bristol.  We need to ensure everyone has a safe and secure place to live, and that those responsible are made to pay the costs.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/02/02/karin-smyth-mp-presses-the-government-for-clarity-as-new-analysis-shows-thousands-of-people-in-bristol-still-living-with-grenfell-style-cladding/">Karin Smyth MP presses the Government for clarity as new analysis shows thousands of people in Bristol still living with Grenfell-style cladding</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p>Bradford South MP Judith Cummins visited The Sutton Centre in BD4 to launch their new Food Pantry which provides essential food and hygiene products to local families.</p>



<p>Open every Wednesday, the pantry asks for a donation of just £3 to fill a bag with a range of tinned goods, cereals and even fresh fruit, vegetables and bread.</p>



<p><strong>Sam Kirkby of The Sutton Centre said</strong>: “The pantry aims to take a bit of pressure off families by offering a great selection of essentials. Much of the produce is <strong>g</strong>enerously donated by Inn churches and supported by Clarion Futures, and the small contribution we ask for means we are often able to keep the pantry topped up with fresh ingredients like fruit, veg and milk and eggs, so that families can make healthy, wholesome meals together.</p>



<p>“We’ve also found that for many people, visiting the pantry and speaking to our staff and volunteers can be some of their only social interaction, so it’s also an opportunity to have chat and improve wellbeing. We’ve also been able to introduce users to some of our other local projects, such as employment support – so it’s very holistic.”</p>



<p><strong>Judith Cummins MP said</strong>: “The Food Pantry is just one of the many ways the team at The Sutton Centre have been supporting the community over the pandemic and is much needed during such difficult times. The team’s work to support the community over the past year has been inspirational.”</p>



<p>The Sutton Centre’s Food Pantry is open every Wednesday 09:30am-2:00pm. For more details, please phone The Sutton Centre on 01274 668881.</p>

<p><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has virtual tour of Busy Bees Nursery in Shire Park, WGC.</strong></p>



<p>Busy Bees Nurseries, the UKs largest nursery group, recently hosted Mr Shapps for a ‘virtual tour’ of their nursery in Welwyn Garden City.</p>



<p>Busy Bees, founded 37 years ago, operate 357 nurseries in the UK and 231 nurseries overseas including Singapore, Australia, Canada, Italy Ireland and the USA.</p>



<p>Founder Marg Randles led the meeting as they discussed the business and their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Shapps had been invited to tour the nursery in person. However, due to the new strain of the virus and national lockdown, it was decided that the tour should take place virtually.</p>



<p>Mr Shapps was shown the nursery’s facilities with a video which highlighted how the staff get children prepared for learning at school.</p>



<p>As part of their efforts to make their environment COVID-secure during lockdown, parents have to drop their children off at the front door. However, they can receive regular updates about their child throughout the day via an app called ParentZone.</p>



<p>In addition, the Busy Bees use a digital learning programme which parents can use with their children at home.</p>



<p>Remarking on his virtual tour, Grant Shapps said: “I was given a really polished virtual tour of the nursery. The facilities look great for the kids and are a testament to the interest that Marg and all the team have in the children’s positive development.</p>



<p>“The nursery looked incredibly welcoming- lots of rooms for different activities and age groups, with plenty of outdoor space. It&#8217;s great to see how well they&#8217;ve managed to adapt to the disruptive effect that COVID has had…It&#8217;s no wonder that they won a Queen&#8217;s Award for Enterprise a few years ago.</p>



<p>“I look forward to visiting in-person someday in the reasonably near future!”</p>

<p>One of the actions of Nottingham City Council’s <a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/media/2619917/2028-carbon-neutral-action-plan-v2-160620.pdf">Carbon Neutral Action Plan</a> is to campaign for divestment and move the Nottinghamshire Local Government Pension Scheme away from fossil fuels investments. This is why ahead of their Annual General Meeting tomorrow I submitted a question on behalf of City members of the scheme, and urged the Fund to commit to consult with its members on a divestment strategy and timeline before their next AGM. This is essential to ensure the long term sustainability of the Fund and to play it’s part in the prevention of catastrophic climate change.<br> <br>The Pension Fund covers over 300 members including Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, the District Councils and many other organisations who are generally non-profit making, or are undertaking a service which was, or could be carried out by the Local Authority. It is controlled by County Councillors and the City Council has no voting rights on the Pension Fund.  <br><br> I know that the primary responsibility of the Pension Fund is to protect the financial benefits of the scheme, and now that there is growing evidence that fossil fuel investments are performing less well than comparators it is the time to grasp the divestment nettle. Currently Nottinghamshire Pension Fund holds at least £170m in fossil fuel company shares and has no investments in sustainable, low carbon or renewable energy equity funds.<br><br>Given over 1300 institutions worldwide have already committed to divestment, including at least 10 UK local government pension funds and a large number of UK universities and faith organisations, it is time for Nottinghamshire to catch up and  do its bit for a sustainable future. <br><br>You can watch the Nottinghamshire Pension Fund AGM live on <a href="https://youtu.be/wdMyWgYd-gA">Youtube</a> from tomorrow at 10:30am.

			<p>In a House of Commons speech, I revealed that over half of the 14,633 Universal Credit (UC) claimants in my constituency are on social security since the start of the pandemic. I then urged the Government to keep the £20 ‘uplift’ for people claiming Universal Credit.</p>
<p>You can read my speech in full below:</p>
<p><em>Universal Credit (UC) has never been fit for purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>When introduced in 2012, it had a number of design flaws including the original 6-week wait for the first payment, a single payment to a household, usually the man, setting women’s independence back a generation, and a monthly payment period creating all sorts of problems for many who were paid weekly, fortnightly and 4-weekly.</em></p>
<p><em>But these were made even worse in 2015 when the then Chancellor did a hatchet job on social security spending. With the cuts to the taper rate and work allowance, the freeze on ‘benefit uprating’, the abolition of disability premiums, and more, by the start of the Covid pandemic approximately £33bn of support had been cut for working age people.  </em></p>
<p><em>Although for some people, UC is more slightly generous than legacy benefits, all the analysis I have seen has shown that UC is far less generous to single parent families and to disabled people.</em></p>
<p><em>UC claimants have been driven into debt, rent arrears and the increase in foodbank demand is attributed to UC’s introduction.</em></p>
<p><em>The associated negative impacts on UC claimants’ health and wellbeing is also now increasingly being understood. For example, a peer-reviewed report published in the Lancet last March showed people who moved onto Universal Credit experienced clinically significant psychological distress as a direct result. Another report from the BMJ showed that the ‘hostile and demeaning’ Universal Credit system worsened physical and mental health.  And the Health in all Policies All Party Parliamentary Group which I chair undertook an inquiry into the impacts of the changes to UC in the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Bill, predicting an increase in child poverty and a subsequent deterioration in child health; sadly, the follow analysis is showing how accurate these predictions were.</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, the discriminatory and punitive nature of UC has even been successfully challenged in the courts.</em></p>
<p><em>Fast forward to the start of the Covid pandemic, when we saw the number of UC claimants increase from over 3 million in March to over 5.6 million in July. As the crisis hit, not everyone could work from home and it was the low paid in vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and leisure who’ve been most affected. We know that this health crisis is far from over, and neither are impacts on the economy and jobs. People need reassurance, that in their time of need, like the NHS, an adequate safety net is there for them. </em></p>
<p><em>In my Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency more than half of the 14,633 claimants are now claiming UC as a result of the pandemic.</em></p>
<p><em>The response I have had from constituents about the debate in Parliament calling for the uplift to be extended has been phenomenal! And it wasn’t just those relying on UC who have written to me reflecting the Health Foundation/IPSOS Mori poll that showed 74% of the public support the increase in UC and want to see it extended beyond March.  </em></p>
<p><em>The UC APPG which I chair held an inquiry into the impact of Covid on claimants last spring and we wrote to the Chancellor with our recommendations last November. We urged him to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Retain the £20 per week uplift to standard allowance beyond April</em></li>
<li><em>Extend the £20 per week uplift to legacy benefits</em></li>
<li><em>Offer new UC claimants an initial non-repayable starter payment instead of making them wait 5 weeks for their first payment, as recommended by the Work and Pensions Select Committee</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I am still waiting for a reply to this letter.</em></p>
<p><em>Save The Children found that parents who were given the uplift predominantly used it to buy food, followed by paying the rent, bills, and essential items needed for school. They estimate that withdrawing this uplift will increase those living in poverty by half a million including 200,000 children. By 2024, the Resolution Foundation estimate that relative poverty will have increased to 23% with an additional 730,000 children living in poverty.</em></p>
<p><em>Even with this uplift people living on UC are struggling to manage. In November, Turn2Us examined the financial resilience of households on different social security support and found that 1 in 5 on UC ‘always’ run out of money compared with only 8% for people not reliant on UC.</em></p>
<p><em>Citizens’ Advice estimate that since the start of the pandemic half a million people have accrued rent arrears with an average of £730 debt. And of course, the ban on evictions also runs out at the end of March. The implications for homelessness are self-evident.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Speaker, as Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s Poverty report has shown, before Covid, there were 14.5 m people living in poverty, that’s 1 in 5 people, and this was escalating in spite of the high employment rate and an increase in the living wage. Work, seen by many as the route out of poverty was failing to deliver, with over 8 million working people living in poverty. 7 out of 10 of the 4m children living in poverty come from working families. Covid saw those already struggling to stay afloat bear the brunt of the economic and the health burden.</em></p>
<p><em>We cannot, we must not let them down. We must extend the UC and Working Tax Credit uplift, and ensure those on legacy benefits also receive the uplift.  </em></p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>

<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Last week I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate entitled <strong>Future of fairs and Showgrounds</strong>. I wanted to support those showmen and women here in South Shields which has a long history of welcoming traveling showmen and women that dates back almost 100 years. It is imperative that the Government stops ignoring the fairground and showmen community and steps in to provide vital support before it is too late. As a longstanding supporter and advocate for show people and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fairs and Showgrounds, I will continue to be a voice for this community and press the Government at every opportunity for better support and recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the outset of the pandemic, many fairs were either cancelled or postponed – from summer fetes to Christmas Markets. As a result of the closures and postponing of fairs, many show people suffered huge financial loss, plunging them into financial insecurity.</p>



<p>The heart of the issue is that the financial support offered to the tourism industry during COVID-19 continually excluded the fairground community. Showmen and women also did not qualify for the assistance announced in the recent budget for retail, leisure and hospitality firms relating to business rates in the coming year, due to the way that the Show people operate, which falls outside the scope of static leisure providers.</p>



<p>Show people across the UK and particularly those here in South Shields, now face losing their businesses and livelihoods if the UK Government does not step in.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

First of all, thank you to everyone who has sent such kind messages to me after last night’s result in Birmingham Northfield. Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br />
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br />
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br />
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br />
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br />
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br />
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br />
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br />
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
