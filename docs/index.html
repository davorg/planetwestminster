            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>For many people, social care is considered as elderly residential care. The reality is far more complex though. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Many of our most vulnerable, fellow citizens also rely on the social care system – those with disabilities, acute learning difficulties and a range of conditions that make living at home in a normal environment highly challenging or even impossible. Many others are not in residential care at all, instead living and being supported in their own homes or the homes of their families.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In largely rural areas like our own, too many of these people, along with their families, have had to suffer in often invisible silence – struggling against or falling through the system, unable to get the level of support they need and deserve. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Throughout my time as the MP for Mid Norfolk, I have always been clear that I believe <span><span>how we take care of some of our most vulnerable people is a measure of us as a society. I firmly believe that a fair, just and civilised society means those with the privilege of able bodied freedom and responsibility do their bit to help those who don’t.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why I have worked so hard to speak up for social care in our county – and why I remain so committed to continuing that work as we move forward.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For too long, our care sector has been the poor relation to the NHS in funding and recognition. This is grossly unfair and a source of huge problems in our local healthcare system, letting down many vulnerable people and costing us, as a county and country, far more money that it should. We should be getting it right and reinvesting more of the savings into delivering even better care.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why I have always been a strong advocate for properly integrating Health and Social Care (see my campaign page </span></span><a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/integrating-health-and-social-care"><span>here</span></a><span><span>) – especially here in Norfolk. While we have seen our five CCGs merged into one, we still have multiple hospital trusts, as well as separate ambulance, mental health and community care trusts, in addition to an ICS! We need less costly administrative bureaucracy and more investment into an integrated local system, led by dedicated local leaders with the vision and local knowledge required to get things right.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>I also believe that we need to ensure the funding models are correct so that the needs of patients and care recipients, and the heroic care workers that do so much to support them (whether they be working in residential homes, family carers or those working out in the community), come before the administrative convenience of Whitehall officials.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to speak up on behalf of social care here in the East.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <h3>Nia Griffith (Llanelli)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Abandoning the 2019 Conservative Manifesto commitment to
the triple lock on state pensions for the second year in a row could leave 17,330
pensioners in Llanelli £900 worse off a year on average, according to new
analysis published today. </p>



<p>Figures from the House of Commons Library shows that
pensioners in the Llanelli constituency face an average cut of £407.75 in
2023/24 if the Conservatives’ manifesto commitment to the triple lock is broken
again when pensions are uprated in April 2023. </p>



<p>The loss is even larger when considering what the state
pension would have been had the triple lock not already been broken in 2022.
Taking this into account, pensioners in Llanelli could be £900 worse off
overall, compared to what the state pension would have been if the triple lock
were applied in 2022 and 2023.</p>



<p>Commenting on the figures, Llanelli Labour MP, Dame Nia
Griffith, said:</p>



<p>“The Tories already betrayed pensioners over the Triple
Lock last year, and it is appalling that they are considering this once again.</p>



<p>“They made a dangerous gamble with the economy and are
now asking pensioners in Llanelli to pay the price.&nbsp; Older people have already endured the largest
ever real-terms cut to their State Pension and now face being another £407.75
worse off under the Tories. </p>



<p>“I will fight to oppose any attempt by the Tories to
break the Triple Lock for next year.&nbsp; I
will always be on the side of pensioners, who have given our country so much
and who deserve security and dignity in retirement.”&nbsp; </p>

<td>I am always happy to bang the drum for British farming and highlight the important contribution to the economy, jobs, the environment and communities that farming, and the food and drinks industry make.</p>
<p>Events in the last few years have shown us how important it is to have a resilient farming sector, producing quality food for both home and abroad.</p>
<p>Food security must remain a top priority for this Government and I want to see DEFRA not just working more closely with the National Farmers Union (NFU) but also championing the pioneering role our Farmers make on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>I am always pleased to support the NFU and our farming industry and I will continue to champion their achievements and take pride in the very valuable contribution they give to our local area and our wider economy.</td>

<p>This Sunday, we will all pause to remember British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who have sacrificed their lives in conflicts since World War 1.</p>
<p>in 2010, I attended the funeral of Lance Corporal Andrew Breeze at Christ Church in Denton.</p>
<p>Lance Corporal Breeze was serving in Afghanistan when he was killed in an explosion whilst clearing an area near Check Point Kingshill. He lost his life while working to improve security in the region.</p>
<p>I was not lucky enough to meet Lance Corporal Breeze, but I am moved by his life to this day. As I sat in church to represent a community in profound morning, I thought about the extraordinary bravery it takes to risk your life for your country, and how no amount of gratitude seems proportionate to the sacrifice made.</p>
<p>When I observe the moment of silence on Sunday, I will be thinking of Lance Corporal Breeze, his family and his friends. More than a million British and Commonwealth service personnel have lost their lives since 1914 – I will also think of them, and pledge that their sacrifice will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I will be in Denton Central to pay my respects, as I make my way to Denton Town Hall and the Cenotaph in Victoria Part. I will then lay wreaths in Denton West at midday and Dukinfield in the afternoon. Wreaths will also be laid at Haughton Green, Audenshaw and Reddish on my behalf.</p>
<p>It will be a solemn but important day. Remembrance is not just about recognising those who have fallen, but also those who continue to risk their lives each and every day to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen war break out in Europe. With Putin’s invasion of Ukraine we are again living in unprecedented and volatile times. The war in Ukraine is not only a reminder of the fragility of peace, but also a testament to the bravery of those who choose to serve their country in the pursuit of liberty, democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>Laurence Binyon’s ‘For the Fallen’ &#8211; often recited at remembrance services across the country &#8211; is a poem that is very close to my heart. The final stanza is my favourite, and perfectly captures the tremendous debt we have to the fallen:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“As the stars they shall be bright when we are dust,  </i></p>
<p><i>Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;  </i></p>
<p><i>As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,  </i></p>
<p><i>To the end, to the end, they remain.”  </i></p></blockquote>

<p><span><span>The Parliamentary Boundary Review Commission for England have today published their revised proposals for the Ludlow Constituency in South Shropshire. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Commenting on the proposals, Philip Dunne said: </span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span>“Today's proposals confirm the initial suggestion from this review, to increase the constituency by some 100 square miles, taking in two large rural wards to the north of the present boundary, namely Burnell and Severn Valley from the Shrewsbury & Atcham constituency, adding some 7,500 voters to take the constituency to within the band around 75,000 voters per constituency.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“While I am saddened to see the historic name of the constituency of ‘Ludlow’, in use in Parliament since the first inception of Ludlow town as a ‘parliamentary borough’ in 1473 and the modernised Parliamentary Constituency since 1885, changed, I think it now makes sense to rename the constituency 'South Shropshire’, which better reflects the proposed geography.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“These proposals will increase the geographic scale of the constituency to some 700 square miles. It already stretches from some 35 miles along the Welsh Border to the west and as far east as to within six miles of Wolverhampton city centre. The South Shropshire constituency will now reach as far north as the edge of Shrewsbury by including Burnell and Severn Valley wards. The southern boundary with Worcestershire and Herefordshire will remain undisturbed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“South Shropshire is a more suitable name with which everyone can identify within the new constituency.”</span></span></p>

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil says the UK Government has zero interest in tackling the excessive transmission charges in the North of Scotland, which are one of the biggest barriers to the region’s renewable potential.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil wrote to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, in September following a meeting earlier this year, urging an end to unjust transmission charges.</p>



<p>Despite some indications at that meeting that this issue would be looked at, the Treasury stated in their response to Mr MacNeil that generators in Scotland do pay higher transmission charges than counterparts in England and Wales.</p>



<p>In the Highlands and Islands, it costs £7.36 per mega-watt (MWh) to transmit electricity from the European Union into the UK energy market. This is 16 times more than sending energy from the European Union into the UK energy market.</p>



<p>Westminster’s sky-high transmission charges are currently the biggest barrier to Scotland’s renewable potential.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “There seems to be a lack of urgency or interest from the UK Government to change their artificial transmission charging system. &nbsp;This is in a week when the world gathers for COP 27 with the target of addressing climate change and speeding up the transition to renewable energy.</p>



<p>“This system is costing 16 times more to take power from the Scottish Highlands to the centre of the UK market than it costs independent countries in the European Union to take energy to the centre of the European market.</p>



<p>“Something is clearly wrong. They have an artificial structure from Ofgem, and this is creating a situation which is working against renewable energy.</p>



<p>“Any other government in Europe, when seeing this crazy situation, would do something to change it, but the UK remains twiddling their thumbs year after year.”</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world&#8217;s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>Events at asylum centres have made the headlines this week, drawing attention to the cost of government funded accommodation. They’re now spending millions on hotels. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That story rather overshadowed a report on exempt accommodation by the Levelling up, Housing and Communities Select Committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exempt accommodation is so called because its exempt from usual housing benefit restrictions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That makes it very lucrative for private providers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The report identifies a number of problems for residents and neighbours and points out that concentrations of such property often results in anti-social behaviour, rubbish, and vermin as well as noise, violence, and drugs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>West Midlands Police say organised crime is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee came to Birmingham where I was pleased to sit in on a couple of sessions and hear what constituents have been telling me for years. Despite two separate attempts on my part, to legislate on this, the government has turned a blind eye. &nbsp;</p>



<p>They’ve also largely ignored a brilliant Birmingham Mail campaign and demands for action from almost every Birmingham MP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chair of the committee, Clive Betts MP, acknowledged that I was the first to raise it with him and suggest an enquiry. You can view our exchange on Facebook. His report confirms my worst fears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It calls for councils to be given powers to limit the number of ‘hostels’ per area, to regulate referrals so that children and victims of domestic abuse aren’t forced to share with people who’ve committed violent offences or have serious drink and drug problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Home Secretary has now given a figure for the cost of her failed asylum strategy but when the committee asked for similar information, the government said it didn’t know how many people were living in exempt accommodation or what it was costing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A report, back in 2016, to the Comptroller and Auditor General suggested it might be around £2.15 billion, money that could be used to build homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I write this, there’s been such upheaval in government that, I’m not yet clear who the new housing minister is but I’m sure he or she must act quickly to end this scandal.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<ul>
<li>In response to a debate called in Westminster Hall on Wednesday 2nd November, the Home Office agreed to look at how restrictions can be eased on international GPs working for the NHS.<br />
• To deliver on this mission, the Minister for Immigration pledged to focus on ‘creative ways to resolve this challenge’, for example working with the sector to explore umbrella sponsors for international GPs and holding meetings with the sector to encourage more GP surgeries to become visa sponsoring practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Wednesday (2nd November), a Westminster Hall debate took place in which the House<br />
considered visas for international doctors.</p>
<p>Matt Warman MP raised the point that under current legislation, GPs who have come from abroad to train in the UK are in a position whereby it is difficult to obtain employment after they graduate. This is mainly because, in order for a General Practice to hire an international graduate, they must be registered as a ‘sponsoring practice’. This requires a large amount of complicated engagement with the Home Office, both on the international GP’s behalf and that of the practice hoping to sponsor them.</p>
<p>Following a discussion of members from different parties, the Minister for Immigration, Robert<br />
Jenrick MP, acknowledged the issues raised and agreed to look at ways to make this process easier. The Minister assured that the Home Office will ‘reflect carefully on the points raised’ and stated that he will ‘task Home Office officials to work with stakeholders in the sector to give greater consideration to the central question of whether there is a simpler way in which GP practices can apply for relevant visas.’</p>
<p>The Minister for Immigration also pledged to ‘ask my officials to work with the sector to see whether there is a way forward to create umbrella bodies, if there is mutual support on both sides’, as well as agreeing to run further engagement events with the sector to discuss the process of becoming a sponsor.</p>
<p>Commenting on the positive outcome of this debate, Matt Warman said: <em>‘The Minister has </em><br />
<em>demonstrated more progress on this important issue in the commitment that he has made to us </em><br />
<em>today than we have seen in some years … I am immensely grateful to all Members who have brought the issue to life, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Minister on the outcome of the review, which will make a real difference to our constituents, and to doctors up and down the country.’</em></p>
<p>Matt will continue to liaise with the Home Office, the NHS and the Royal Colleges in order to turn this promise into action as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This month a care provider in my constituency is closing, citing the workforce crisis. I listened to the Minister during the question session and remembered the current Chancellor spending the last year before his appointment telling anyone who would listen about the critical need for a workforce strategy. So, the Department should be pushing at an open Treasury door. I will continue to speak up for those working in the care sector to ensure they are not forced out by low pay, poor conditions or substandard training and development. For too long the Tory Government has taken a sticking plaster approach to social care. If they continue along this path the summer NHS crisis – yes, you read that right: summer – will spiral out of control into the worst winter crisis we have ever witnessed.</p>
<p>I was pleased to visit Bottle Yard Studios’ brand-new facility with City Mayor, Marvin Rees, and South West Regional Mayor, Dan Norris. The £12 million facility looks incredible and was supported by the West of England Combined Authority. For those who are unaware, The Bottle Yard Studios is the largest dedicated film and TV studio facility in the West of England. Eight stages are available across their main site, and they now have three additional premium stages at their new facility. With a giant green screen, furnished production offices and ancillary workspaces – plus a thriving hub of creative businesses – they really do have everything needed for a fully supported shoot. It’s really exciting to see this development and I look forward to seeing what is achieved in this brilliant space.</p>
<p>Continuing on the theme of visiting great businesses in and around Bristol, I popped over to Airbus. It was great to meet Sue Partridge as the new Head of Site and to have an update on Airbus including their plans to have a Zero Emissions Development Centre (ZEDC) on site. I was also given a short tour of their new Aerospace Integrated Research &#038; Test Centre (AIRTeC) and the opportunity to meet apprentices working on some of these exciting projects. Apprenticeships come not just from Airbus but employers in their supply chain in Bristol and the region. It’s vital for our regional economy.</p>
<p>Following the interest rate hike from the Bank of England – the largest in over 30 years &#8211; I know that the cost-of-living crisis hitting everyone hard: people in Bristol are feeling the pinch. Bristol Council is making funds available to help people cut their bills. You may be eligible to funds and support to install a range of insulation and low-carbon technologies including external wall, cavity wall, loft, and underfloor insulation, double glazing and energy efficient doors, and solar PV. Other schemes are also available. To find out more, visit the website here.  </p>

<p>This article was written by John and originally published on </p>



<p>All through the pandemic, Universal Credit (UC) was the dog that didn’t bark. No matter what happened with furlough, ‘bounceback loans’ or dozens of other one-off schemes to minimise the economic damage of a once-in-a-century medical emergency, UC carried on quietly delivering lifeline benefits for people who lost their jobs. It didn’t fall over. It didn’t collapse. The waiting lists didn’t balloon. It just worked. If only the passport office, driving license renewals, and GP surgery appointments were half as good.</p>



<p>Just imagine what would have happened if we’d still been using its complicated and unpredictable predecessor systems, where six different benefits changed every time someone started or stopped a job, gained or lost a partner, worked a few extra hours or moved house. All those moving parts made the old system over-complicated and brittle in normal times: just imagine the collective meltdown if it had been asked to deal with a pandemic on top.</p>



<p>All that complexity wasn’t just brittle either. It destroyed work incentives, because most people had no idea whether they would be better or worse off once their benefits had been recalculated if they took a better job, or worked a bit more overtime. This destroyed work incentives and entrenched poverty because many people concluded (rather logically) that it was simpler and safer not to do anything which might disrupt their existing payments.</p>



<p>But even though Universal Credit proved it was strong and robust during the pandemic, it faces another huge stress test now as both energy and food bills balloon and the cost of living spirals upwards. Putting aside for one moment the crucial issue of uprating, there are still major problems to be solved.</p>



<p>The biggest one is the ‘five week wait’, because Universal Credit is paid a month in arrears, so anyone who isn’t already claiming and loses their job gets no benefits for the first five weeks.</p>



<p>For someone with even a modest savings cushion, a final monthly pay cheque from their last job or even a severance payment of some kind, this is manageable; they will be able to fund essentials like rent, food and even heating until the first benefits payment arrives.</p>



<p>But for anyone else, and who wasn’t being paid monthly and who therefore only has a final weekly or even daily pay cheque from their last job, sky-rocketing energy and fuel bills will be completely unaffordable because they have nothing to fall back on. The result is hardship, poverty, and debt: the cross-party&nbsp;<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5801/ldselect/ldeconaf/105/10502.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee</a>&nbsp;found ‘the five-week wait is the primary cause of insecurity in Universal Credit. It entrenches debt, increases poverty, and harms vulnerable groups disproportionately’ and that it makes people more likely to use food banks, miss meals, fail to heat their homes, and build up significant rent arrears.</p>



<p>Ministers have already cut the initial wait from seven to five weeks and introduced safer government-provided loans with easier repayment terms to try to bridge the gap. But the IPPR think tank’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/no-one-left-behind" target="_blank">recent report <em>No one left </em></a><font color="#1d76e4"><i>Behind</i></font> showed that many people don’t know the loans exist. And even when they do, IPPR found cases whose applications were turned down when they should have been approved.</p>



<p>More fundamentally still, loans are treating the symptoms of a problem which the benefits system itself has created, rather than solving the causes to make sure it doesn’t happen in the first place. Rather obviously for vulnerable people with no jobs, it is both economically and morally better to design a system which doesn’t deliberately push benefits claimants into poverty, hardship, and debt in the first place.</p>



<p>How do we do that? Well, for every new Universal Credit Claimant without enough savings to cover the five-week wait, we should start paying benefits at the same frequency as they were being paid in their previous job. So someone who was paid daily would get daily UC micropayments, weekly would get them weekly and so forth. Once they were safely up and running, the frequency could be lengthened slowly, in manageable steps, until it became monthly like everybody else.</p>



<p>It would mean software changes but, no matter how much benefits have to be uprated to keep pace with surging inflation over the coming months, these improvements wouldn’t add a single penny to the overall benefits bill. They would simply reschedule payments which were going to happen anyway, bringing them forward in time so they happen sooner.</p>



<p>So the costs to taxpayers ought to be no higher and, by helping more vulnerable benefits claimants avoid poverty, hardship and debt, both claimants and taxpayers would stop problems from spiralling downwards, and becoming more severe and expensive to fix as a result. Prevention is always better than cure, as the saying goes!</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>More than 30,000 patients across Morecambe Bay waited more than 2 weeks to see a GP in September, new research by the Liberal Democrats has revealed .</p>
<p>This made up nearly 19% of all GP appointments, up from the 11% of patients who waited more than two weeks to see their doctor in January.</p>
<p>Across the country, over 5 million people waited more than two weeks for a GP appointment in September, making up 17.9% of all GP visits.</p>
<p>Tim has said the "alarming figures" show that patients in South Cumbria are being let down.</p>
<p>It comes as the Liberal Democrats have set out plans for patients to have a right to see their GP within a week, or within 24 hours if in urgent need.</p>
<p>The policy would enshrine this right in the NHS Constitution, putting a duty on the government and health service to make sure it happens. It would be achieved by increasing the number of GPs, fixing pension rules to prevent so many doctors retiring</p>
<p>early, and increasing the number of nurses and pharmacists fully qualified to prescribe day to day medicines.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"These alarming figures show our local health service is being driven into the ground under this Conservative government.</em></p>
<p><em>"Behind these statistics are so many people and families in</em> <em>Cumbria anxiously waiting for an appointment for worrying symptoms. Many are being seen far, far too late.</em></p>
<p><em>"I am proud that Liberal Democrats have put forward a credible plan to ensure everyone is seen by a GP within one week. It should be implemented with urgency to save our local health service and finally give people in</em> <em>Cumbria a fair deal.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Every day the government's promises become more and more hollow. The sad truth is they're disinterested in our NHS, and refuse to take action to pull it back from the brink.</em>
</p>
<p><em>"People here in</em> <em>Cumbria will pay the price if this government continues to take us for granted and sit on their hands."</em></p>

<p>A protest led outside Downing Street has called on the Prime Minister to ‘bring Jaggi home’, as the family of Jagtar Singh Johal mark the 5th anniversary of the Dumbarton man’s unlawful detention in India.</p>



<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes joined Jagtar’s family on the steps of 10 Downing Street to hand over a letter and petition pressing PM Rishi Sunak to act.</p>



<p>Scottish Sikh Jagtar – known as Jaggi – was arrested in India after his wedding in November 2017, accused of helping to fund a Sikh-on-Hindu assassination plot – something he and his family strongly deny.</p>



<p>An investigation by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled in May that there was no legal basis for Jagtar’s detention in India, citing multiple violations of his human rights – including claims he was tortured into signing a false ‘confession’, through electric shocks to his ear lobes, nipples, and genitals.</p>



<p>Hundreds of protesters marched on Downing Street this week, alongside Jagtar’s family and local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes, demanding the UK government calls for Jaggi’s release.</p>

<p>Joining the protest rally was Richard Ratcliffe and his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman who was detained in Iran for six years after being accused of plotting to overthrow the government.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“We have seen so many Prime Ministers, Foreign Secretaries during Jagtar’s 5 years of arbitrary detention that even I start to lose count.</p>



<p>“It is a horrendous, and quite frankly, a pathetic scenario in which the British government finds itself when it deals with my constituent’s case.</p>



<p>“It’s time for Rishi Sunak and the UK Foreign Secretary to defend Jagtar’s rights to a free and fair trial. Trade is important but it should not be at the expense of the human rights of a young Scot from Dumbarton.</p>



<p>“Jagtar’s family here in West Dunbartonshire have campaigned tirelessly for his release. We dedicate ourselves to continuing the campaign for Jaggi &#8211; to secure justice and bring him home to his family.”</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Dear Chancellor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the forthcoming Autumn Statement.</p>
<p>As our new Chancellor, you made a commitment to compassion in your fiscal decision-making. As co-Chair of the APPG for Compassionate Politics and Chair of the APPG on Dementia, I would like you to consider disabled people, including those living with dementia, in your pledge to be compassionate.</p>
<p>As a compassionate Conservative, I hope that you will not only protect disabled people from any further public spending cuts, but recognise disabled people as a group, protected under the 2010 Equality Act, who have been disproportionately and detrimentally affected by legislative and spending decisions over the last 12 years. This discrimination of disabled people has been <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/ehrc-taking-action-improve-treatment-disabled-benefit-claimants">recognised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission</a>, who, in April 2022, announced it was seeking a section 23 agreement with the Government’s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to address this. I understand that, 6 months on, this still hasn’t been agreed.</p>
<p>Last year, the APPG for Health in All Policies, which I also chair, <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/five-years-on-the-health-effects-of-the-2016-welfare-reform-and-work-act-on-children-and-disabled-people/">collated evidence of the health effects of DWP policies and spending cuts</a> on children and disabled people. It provided evidence that by this year, £34bn will have been cut from working age support from the social security budget since 2010. From these disadvantaged families, the most disadvantaged households were those with one disabled adult and a disabled child, who lost £3 in every £10 or £6500 a year.</p>
<p>The fiscal decisions made by previous Conservative Governments between 2010 and 2017 in particular, added to the structural inequalities across our country and the vulnerability of key groups. And then Covid-19 hit and exposed this brutal reality.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbydisabilitystatusenglandandwales/24january2020to9march2022">According to the ONS,</a> in England and Wales during the first wave of the pandemic, the most severely disabled women were 2.4 times more likely to die from Covid than non-disabled women and the most severely disabled men were twice as likely to die than their non-disabled peers. Even after ‘… adjusting for age, residence type, geography, socio-economic and demographic factors, health characteristics, and vaccination status this significantly greater risk of death remains for all disabled people remains largely unchanged across the three waves of the coronavirus pandemic’.</p>
<p>As Professor Sir Michael Marmot <a href="https://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/build-back-fairer-the-covid-19-marmot-review">said in his analysis</a> of the UK’s ‘high and unequal’ Covid-19 death toll, the key causes of this were the existing poverty and inequalities driven by 10 years of austerity including social security cuts.</p>
<p>However, the impacts of austerity and of Covid-19 are not behind us. They are still being felt especially by disabled people during this cost of living and energy crisis. I’m sharing with you the findings of the Big Disability Survey conducted by <a href="https://gmdisabledpeoplespanel.com/">Greater Manchester disabled person’s panel</a>. It is the largest survey of disabled people in the UK.</p>
<p>The report highlights the barriers disabled people face and states “disabled people in Greater Manchester are living under a threefold assault on their rights and quality of life: firstly, through austerity, then Covid-19 and now as a result of the ‘cost-of-living’ crisis”.</p>
<p>Several key areas of action are identified, starting with the need to increase disabled people’s income. The findings reveal that disabled people are experiencing shocking levels of poverty. Their recommendations include for the Government to:</p>
<p>1.    ensure social security support is uprated at least in line with current levels of inflation (10.1%)<br />
2.    introduce a disabled persons cost of living payment of £150 for all disabled people<br />
3.    get energy suppliers to introduce social tariffs and remove additional pre-payment meter costs<br />
4.    stop the DWP acting as the debt collector for utility companies and others by deducting arrears from social security payments<br />
5.    provide Warm Home Discounts to all disabled people</p>
<p>Other areas of concern include the lack of decent, affordable, and accessible housing, social care provision, accessible transport and much more. The failure of the Government to uphold the articles of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a particular issue and, as you will be aware, was <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7367/">highlighted by a UN Committee</a> in 2017 who investigated breaches by the UK Government. It is clear that many of those participating in the GM disabled people’s panel believe the Government’s lack of consideration of their human rights has not changed.</p>
<p>I would be grateful if you could provide me with a response that I may share with GM disabled people.</p>
<p>Specifically, on dementia, I was grateful to former Prime Minister Johnson for committing to funding for the ‘Dementia Moonshot’ in August 2022 after his 2019 manifesto pledge; however I understand that the delivery timetable for the £160m a year for dementia research hasn’t yet been defined. I’d be grateful for confirmation of this in the Autumn Statement.</p>
<p>Again, I am sure you’re aware that in addition to dementia being the leading cause of death in the UK, it was also the main pre-existing health condition in Covid deaths in the first wave (1 in 5 people who died of Covid had dementia). The prevalence of dementia will only increase and not just in the UK where by 2050 we estimate we will have 1.6m people living with dementia, but globally as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/policy-and-influencing/2021-appg-report-fuelling-moonshot#content-start">Last year’s Dementia APPG inquiry</a> into research into the brain diseases that cause dementia and how we prevent, detect and treat them, left me with no doubt that the UK Dementia Research Institute together with our health and life sciences research sector more widely, could lead these developments globally. In addition to improving our health and wellbeing, this area of investment has the potential to contribute to our economy.</p>
<p>Similarly, this year’s <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/policy-and-influencing/all-party-parliamentary-group-dementia">APPG inquiry into dementia</a> and the social care workforce <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-09/APPG%20on%20Dementia%20Workforce%20Matters%20Report%202022.pdf">Workforce Matters Report 2022</a> made it clear that we need a workforce that is specially trained and knowledgeable about dementia, the diseases that cause it and the care approaches that are needed to deliver quality care. I do hope you’ll be able to support the recommendations within this; in particular the call for a comprehensive People Plan for our social care workforce to deliver the specialist, person-centred care with and for people living with dementia, and their family carers.</p>
<p>I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>Please note that this letter and any response you provide will be placed in the public domain.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams MP<br />
Oldham East and Saddleworth</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong>Local MP Grant Shapps recently visited the hazardous Swanland Road-Dixon’s Hill Junction after a spate of traffic incidents over previous months prompted concern from residents.</strong></p>



<p>The Welwyn Hatfield MP discussed the incidents with Councillor Teresa Travell who joined him on the visit.</p>



<p>Mr Shapps and Cllr Travell agreed on the need for Hertfordshire County Council Highways to step up and rectify the issue &#8211; whether that be by installing clearer signage, or reducing the speed limit in the vicinity of the junction.</p>



<p>On the matter, when contacted by Mr Shapps’ office, Hertfordshire County Council previously said that the “junction was identified as a hazardous site in the 2021-2022 annual review” but “no further investigation was undertaken as the most recent collision record appears to be on a downward trend.”</p>



<p>It added, “at present, Hertfordshire County Council have no proposed casualty reduction or speed compliance schemes at the Dixons Hill Road/ Swanland Road junction.</p>



<p>“However, if collision numbers begin to increase at this location, the site will be identified as part of the annual collision investigation reviews that are undertaken.”</p>



<p>Of the visit, Mr Shapps said, “the county council and highways need to act now to reduce the likelihood of another serious incident in the future.”</p>



<p>“Residents are concerned for a reason. When there is a risk to life and limb it is best to be proactive not reactive”.</p>



<p>“I will be monitoring the Swanland Road-Dixon’s Hill Junction very carefully, and working with Teresa to make sure residents&#8217; concerns are addressed.”</p>



<p>Cllr Travell followed up Mr Shapps’ comments by saying, “I’m grateful to Grant for coming to take a look at the junction today.</p>



<p>“His help will be invaluable in getting this issue resolved. I’m sure that his involvement will go some way to alleviating residents’ concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>From January 2016, when previous engineering works at the junction were completed, to December 2017, there were two slight and two serious personal injury collisions recorded at the junction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two collisions occurred in December 2019 and another in 2021.</p>



<p>This data does not include incidents that were not reported to the police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>North Mymms Parish Council has challenged the speed limit in the vicinity of the junction on a number of occasions but has been unsuccessful in getting it reduced.</p>



<p>The junction is situated close to a bend in the road over a bridge crossing the A1 and is not well marked.</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p><span class="searchHighlight">Halloween</span> is a time when scary things are supposed to happen. Ghosts, zombies, and ghouls are the order of the day. Westminster, however, hasn’t waited and has been playing out its own real-life horror stories within the crumbling walls of the Palace. Like some ghastly rickety fanfare, we’ve seen frightening and dangerous things unfold for years, picking up speed in the past weeks and months as breathless newscasters break the news of more dark intrigue and betrayal. Make no mistake, this may look like a rollercoaster ride, but it is a dirty old carousel with the same old dangerously unfit horses going round and round in ever-decreasing circles.</p>
<p>Of course, seeing the first Asian Hindu take office is truly welcome, but this isn’t a new broom with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The Tories have been in office for over 12 years. He’s the ‘Party gate Chancellor” who broke his own laws. He isn’t going to make things better; he’s continuing their long-running austerity programme, degrading public services and growing food bank dependency. As a Brexiteer, he happily wedded us all to the deeply toxic Brexit ideology harming our businesses, starving them of vital staff and turbocharging inflation &#8211; especially basic food items, now running at up to 60% more.</p>
<p>Westminster’s hall of mirrors also shows Labour wedded to “make Brexit work”. It’s a nonsensical stance that, hand in hand with their stated belief that the Tories are not deporting enough people quickly enough is a chilling reflection.</p>
<p>And just when you thought that one of the most frightening apparitions had been removed, it is back where it was. Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, whose dream is *not* of a brighter future for families, or a reduced skills shortage or even an end to people trafficking. No, it is her stated “dream and obsession” to see a flight take asylum seekers to Rwanda. Sacked only 6 days earlier having broken the ministerial code, she is back in the job tasked with upholding law and order and breached national security. She is back alongside colleagues at the helm of the ghostly pirate ship that is the Tory Government.</p>
<p>It’s a horror show we should be done with. The UK is substantially poorer than independent counties comparable to Scotland, with wider inequality, higher child and pensioner poverty and lower productivity. It is time for Scotland to choose a better path.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Parliament return to Westminster on Mondays after spending the weekend in their constituencies. Parliamentary business in the Chamber starts at 2.30pm with Oral Questions, and following the end of Orals, there are often UK Government Statements, and/or Urgent Questions (UQs) about events that have occurred throughout the world and the UK over the weekend. The UK Government decides which Statements it presents, but it is the Speaker who chooses which UQs are granted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last Monday there were 2 UQs at 3.45pm on <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-24/debates/ECCEF9B2-FD8D-424D-B1E7-1526A5884780/GreatBritishRailways">The Future of GB Railways</a>, and The Imminent Closure of <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-24/debates/4D724395-D3B2-498E-A7DF-962B3A940E54/DoncasterSheffieldAirport">Doncaster Sheffield Airport</a>, which was followed by a Statement on The Publication of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-24/debates/4DFF9311-EDE4-4B14-9026-84130D08B9A3/IndependentInquiryIntoChildSexualAbuseFinalReport">Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse: Final Report. </a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The MPs were eager to see which UK Government Ministers appeared at the Dispatch Box after the new PM had appointed his members of Cabinet and Front Bench. Kevin Foster MP has been Transport Minister from 7th September 2022, and he appeared for the UK Government in the first UQ, (but was sacked on Wednesday). Katherine Fletcher MP (South Ribble) was promoted to Under Secretary of State for Transport and appeared in the second UQ. The Statement was delivered by Grant Shapps, as Secretary of State for the Home Department, but the new PM replaced Shapps with Suella Braverman, who had been sacked by Liz Truss following a breach of the Ministerial Code. Mr Shapps was only in post for six days, and Ms Braverman was only out of post for six days. Mr Shapps was appointed as Secretary of State for BEIS, after the Boris-backer Rees-Mogg was sacked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-24">Chamber business for Monday</a> was financial supplementary estimates, the Stamp Duty Bill (England), EU Delegated Legislation (without debate), and an Adjournment Debate on Doncaster Airport granted to Doncaster Central MP Nick Fletcher.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are many events that take place outside the Chamber. One of which are All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) that are very important for raising issues and campaigning for worthwhile causes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, I attended 4 APPGs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/liver-disease-and-liver-cancer">APPG for Liver Disease and Liver Cancer</a> has been at the forefront of raising awareness of the hidden prevalence of Liver Disease in the UK. The UK is facing a liver disease public health emergency with the main causes being alcohol, obesity, and viral hepatitis, which are prevalent in disadvantaged communities. Public Health Data from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-health-improvement-and-disparities">Office for Health Improvement and Disparities</a> (OHID) highlights that liver disease mortality rates are nearly 4 times higher in most deprived areas, with regional variations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We heard from Professor Julia Verne, Deputy Director in the OHID, about her research on levelling up liver disease outcomes to narrow the gap in healthy life expectancy. Professor Verne previously worked at a Liver Unit and saw first hand the challenges facing patients with cirrhosis and advanced liver disease. Mortality rates are very high for patients diagnosed at a late stage. But 90% of liver disease is preventable and in many cases can be reversed or halted, because if diagnosed early, the liver has the ability to regenerate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa Hebditch, Director of Policy and Comms at the <a href="https://britishlivertrust.org.uk/">British Liver Trust</a>, gave an update of the launch of Liver Cancer UK. Its research found that only 26% of areas in the UK have an effective pathway for the early detection and management of liver disease. Urgent action is needed to level up inequalities in liver disease care and outcomes. Liver disease is the leading cause of premature deaths and lost working years. The Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill will place a statutory duty on the UK Government to report back on delivery of narrowing the gap in healthy life expectancy between areas of lowest and highest areas by 2030, and increase healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035. But the British Liver Trust and our APPG are calling for a full review of adult liver services by NHS England to address unwarranted variation in treatment care and outcomes. Health and Social Care are devolved, and there is an established early detection and management pathway operating in Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://twitter.com/steelappg">APPG for Steel and Related Metal Industries</a> continues to promote the importance of UK Steel Production which strengthens national resilience, its jobs are crucial to levelling up, growing market opportunity, vital to environmental challenges, and boosts infrastructure potential. The UK Steel Sector produces 7.2 million tonnes a year, 70% of UK requirements, directly employs 34,500 people with a further 43,000 in the supply chain, pays an average £37,629, 45% higher than UK national median, contributes £2.4 billion to UK GDP, and £3.1 billion in supply chains. The priority for the sector is competitive electricity prices, net-zero steel strategy, level trading field, using UK steel in UK infrastructure projects, and innovation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/hospitality-events-and-major-food-and-drink-businesses-in-wales">APPG for Hospitality, Events, Major Food and Drink Businesses in Wales</a> was addressed by Dave Chapman, Executive Director, UK Hospitality Cymru, and Kate Nicholls, Chief Executive, UK Hospitality. We were joined online by a number of businesses located in Wales who told us about the challenges of operating in the hospitality and events sectors following the major challenges resulting from years of austerity, Brexit and Covid-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are struggling to survive because of rising costs, and diminishing footfall. Energy bills have doubled, and suppliers are not offering favourable deals after the 6 month UK Government support scheme ends in April 2023. There is an acute shortage of labour which has caused many hospitality venues and events to reduce operations from full time opening to around 80%. There is a UK vacancy rate of 10% and it’s 15% in Wales. UK Hospitality are calling for a Welsh Government Minister for Hospitality who would work with UK Government, an All-Party Senedd Group for Hospitality, deregulation of the immigration regime which takes at least 12 weeks for a work visa application to be processed, and it does not support a tourism levy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/uk-shared-prosperity-fund">APPG on the UK Shared Prosperity Fund</a> has written many times to UK Ministers in BEIS, Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Department DLUHC, who change every time there is a new PM, asking for clarification on how the UKSPF would operate. The latest letter on 20 September 2022 was to Simon Clarke, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, who held the position for the duration of Liz Truss’s reign. We told Mr Clarke about the very successful UKSPF Stakeholder Online Event, attended by over 180 representatives from public, private, voluntary, community and business organisations across England, Scotland and Wales, setting out their views. We highlighted five problematic areas: the short timescale for drawing up investment plans; the local authority-led structure for drawing up investment plans is a problem for organisations that operate across boundaries; all investment plans should be published online by DLUHC, so that organisations can work out how they fit in; the hiatus in funding in 2023-4 will cause redundancies and re-recruiting in 2024; the EU 7-year programme with a roll-on spending option for a further 3 years has been replaced with a 3-year (now two and a half years) UKSPF with no guarantee of funding beyond 2024-5. Mr Clarke did not respond to our letter before he was replaced. The APPG has always had difficulty in finding out which UK Government Minister is responsible for the UKSPF, which crosses Whitehall Departments. And when we do have constructive dialogue with a Minister, for example Neil O’Brien, they are replaced, and we have to start again. Another problem is that the UK Government Spending Reviews work on a 3-year timeline, and 2024-5 hasn’t been signed off yet, and this will produce a “cliff edge” for any prospective UKSPF projects. The UK Government has created the Future High Streets Fund, Towns Fund, Levelling Up Fund, Community Renewal Fund, and the UKSPF. There is a rumour that these would be amalgamated and the UKSPF will be subsumed. The APPG decided that we would meet again after the LUHCC Cross Party Committee concludes its enquiry into Levelling Up, which it launched on 20th October 2022, and includes looking into whether the UKSPF is a sufficient replacement of EU Structural Funds – evidence sessions begin next month.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is a stand-off between UK and Welsh Government. The APPG wrote to Vaughan Gethin, Minister for Economy in the Welsh Government, and his reply stated that the UK Government’s engagement with Welsh Government Ministers and its officials has been unacceptable. Despite years of work in Wales developing the strongest possible model for post-EU regional investment, the Welsh Government were only consulted in April 2022, because the UK Government wanted to publish its SPF prospectus before the local elections in May 2022. The Welsh Government does not endorse and will not support delivery of UK policies and programmes in Wales which are flawed and undermine the devolution settlement. The Welsh Government suggested a simple formula based on the <a href="https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Community-Safety-and-Social-Inclusion/Welsh-Index-of-Multiple-Deprivation">Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation</a> (WIMD) taking into account a wide range of socio-economic factors, including income, employment, education and distance from services. The UK Government gave the WIMD a 30% weighting and combined it with its Community Renewal Fund Index. But this disadvantages Welsh local authorities with larger populations, and as a result, two of the more populous local authorities Rhondda Cynon Taff (RCT) and Caerphilly, which would have high allocations under the WIMD, will have allocations barely above the Wales average. The Welsh Government was not consulted on the final allocations before publication by the UK Government, and consider the SPF formula to be complicated, methodologically flawed, and not reflective of economic need. The UK Government’s repeated promises to replace EU Structural and Investment Funds in full falls £1.1 billion short between January 2021 and March 2025. For these reasons and those set out in Mr Gethin’s written statements of 13th April and 1st June, the Welsh Government will not be using its resources to support the implementation of the SPF in Wales but will support local government partners to implement the fund, despite its inadequacies. Mr Gethin has also written to Michael Gove to stress that the Welsh Government would welcome further discussion and a genuine co-decision-making arrangement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/pension-clawback">APPG on Pension Clawback</a>, which was formed to campaign against banks such as HSBC and Midland Bank, clawing back state pensions from the amount of occupational pension that they pay to former employees, met online to listen to an update from our chair, Clive Betts MP, and to have a preview of research being conducted by <a href="https://law.exeter.ac.uk/public/probono/">University of Exeter Law Department</a> into Defined Contributions and the use of State Clawback. This independent research is using personal experiences of the post-1974 Midland Pension Scheme Section, with respect to the legality and actions of organisations who have applied clawback to pension schemes, and the impact on employees in these organisations. I look forward to its publication.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I went into the chamber for <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-10-26/debates/DA634E71-6A00-4C9C-8D40-CCE730776B42/Engagements">Prime Minister’s Questions</a> (PMQs) Wednesday lunchtime to watch the new PM’s first performance at the Dispatch Box. Keir Starmer asked whether the PMs officials had raised concerns about the decision to re-appoint the Home Secretary just days after she had been sacked for a security breach, but Rishi Sunak failed to answer. Keir said the Tories put Party first and Country second, with working people paying for their mess. Keir said that Rishi was a PM who got trounced by his successor who herself was beaten by a lettuce. There were repeated calls for a General Election from opposition MPs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned to Neath constituency on Thursday 27<sup>th</sup> October, I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1587008443189190657?cxt=HHwWgoCz_anxl4YsAAAA">Dove Workshop in Banwen</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DOVE Workshop has been awarded a tree from Buckingham Palace, as part of the late <a href="https://queensgreencanopy.org/get-involved/communities-and-groups/">Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee initiatives</a>. The tree has been awarded to Dove Workshop in recognition for all that it has achieved; for the work it has done in inspiring the communities it serves, and on the understanding that there is an expectation they will continue to deliver services of the same quality for a good many years to come.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ceremony was led by the <a href="http://www.lordlieutenantwestglamorgan.org.uk/">Lord Lieutenant, Mrs Louise Fleet JP</a>, and Dove Workshop’s Manager, Lianne Byrne. The Tree of Trees was planted in Dove’s Sarn Helen Garden, where it will take pride of place and by nurtured to grow as a reminder of this moving tribute to both Dove Workshop and our late Queen.</p>

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Judith Cummins MP has called on the government to use the power of sport as a ‘force for good’ to bring investment into Bradford.</p>



<p>Speaking in a debate on the contribution of the Rugby League world cup to culture and sport in the UK, Judith highlighted how sport is at the heart of local communities in her Bradford South constituency:</p>



<p>“Week in, week out, local communities come together to support their clubs, their local kids’ teams and young players.”</p>



<p>“However, levels of investment and opportunities haven’t always matched the pride we feel in our towns and cities, but it’s moments like the world cup that will give communities the opportunities to stand tall and showcase where they live to the world.”</p>



<p>“A compelling levelling-up bid has been submitted to government for a world-class stadium and training complex for elite sports with a Rugby League Skills, Training and Education centre in Odsal to serve the people of Yorkshire and the North. I can’t wait to host the world cup again in a decade’s time and be standing in our very own Odsal stadium in Bradford cheering England on!”</p>



<p>Responding to Judith’s invitation to visit Odsal, Sports Minister Stuart Andrew MP said: “If I’m still in post by the end of the week I’ll still come but, if not, I’ll leave a note to my successor that their first trip needs to be to Bradford!”</p>



<p>The 2022 Cup’s world-leading social impact programme has invested more than £26 million in equipment and facilities, volunteering, mental health, culture and education, to transform clubs into hubs for their communities. And, for the first time, the men’s, women’s and wheelchair tournaments will be held concurrently.</p>



<p>A study from the Sheffield Hallam University shows that investment in sport and physical activity gives back four times the investment in social value, equivalent to around £72 billion each year across the UK, improving people’s health and wellbeing, creating jobs and stimulating local economic growth.</p>



<p>Judith is fighting for Bradford to have its share:</p>



<p>“When the competition is over and the winning teams raise their trophies, it is only the start of the story for communities, not the end. With the Rugby League world cup in full swing, Bradford’s year as capital of culture in 2025, and Bradford’s bid for a world-class stadium and sports complex that will bring over a billion pounds of benefits to Bradford, now is the time to ensure that people of Bradford benefit from this legacy.”</p>

<p>This has been another tumultuous period in British politics culminating with the resignation of the Prime Minister. This had looked inevitable once her mini-budget had to be reversed following the loss of market confidence. The Prime Minister’s diagnosis of the need to do more to increase the growth rate was correct, but sadly the policies she prescribed made the situation worse and it’s right that she has resigned.</p>



<p>We knew that Liz Truss was inheriting a difficult position a few weeks ago with the ongoing cost of living crisis, the significant NHS backlogs, the war in Ukraine and the resulting serious issues with energy prices and supply. To those crises we can now add the market turmoil and the increases in interest rates which are so painful for those with mortgages and will worsen the public finances given the amount of debt we owe – and our ongoing need to borrow.</p>



<p>We should have a new Prime Minister in place by the end of next week, in time for the critical statement by the Chancellor on 31 October setting out the details of the public finances and proposed measures to bring borrowing under control. Regrettably it looks very likely that this will include some difficult measures including tax rises and spending cuts. We will need the new Prime Minister and their team to present a coherent plan that we can unite behind to avoid any further market turmoil.</p>



<p>There has been speculation that these measures should include restricting the increases in the state pension and benefits next April to less than the inflation rate of 10.1%. While increases of this level will represent a significant cost, we cannot seek to balance the books on the backs of the least well off and those unable to work to earn extra money. The state pension has never increased by less than inflation and I’m glad the outgoing Prime Minister confirmed the increase would indeed be 10.1%. We should do the same for benefits too. We can’t expect people livings on the least to get through next winter with less money in real terms than this one.</p>



<p>There have been encouraging signs that global gas prices have started to fall. I hope that this continues and signals that efforts to boost supply and reduce demand around the world have stabilised the position. There are however significant risks this winter and next that in the event of a lengthy period of cold weather we might run out of gas. In the short term we all need to be careful with our use – to reduce our bills and protect supply.</p>



<p>In the longer term we need to do more to obtain secure domestic sources of energy including nuclear, wind solar – and fracking for our own gas. None of these are easy – and very often applications are unpopular. The key thing is to ensure we develop these in areas where they have the least impact and that all applications are properly considered through the planning process with local people consulted. We’ve gone further on fracking and proposed requiring actual local consent which is not required for other planning issues. Again, none of this is easy or popular but relying on cheap imports from abroad is no longer a viable strategy.</p>

<p>I was deeply concerned to read the decision taken by the Court in this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63313556">case</a>.</p>
<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>
<p>I will be urgently raising these concerns with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General’s office.</p>

<p>Dear Constituent</p>
<p>I am writing with a reminder about a couple of local things.</p>
<p>A few people have asked me why I do not address national issues in these emails except where there is useful information to provide. I know that many people want to discuss those issues with me, and I am always willing to do so if they contact me directly. But these emails are designed to be informative about local matters, and go to everyone who wants them, regardless of political persuasion, and I do not want to change their local focus even at times when there are significant events at a national level.</p>
<h2>Charity Fair</h2>
<p>Firstly, a reminder that the Charity Volunteer Fair, which was postponed because of the sad death of Her Majesty the Queen, is being held between 4pm and 6pm this Friday, 21<sup>st</sup> October at the Dell Centre, St Giles Church, Park Lane, Ashtead, KT21 1EJ.</p>
<p>More than 20 charities will be there, and there will be a wide range of volunteering opportunities. So please do come along. If you can’t make it but are interested in volunteering, please let me know and I will steer you towards the right opportunities.</p>
<h2>Epsom Methodist Church &#8211; Warm Wednesdays</h2>
<p>Epsom Methodist Church is launching a programme of Warm Wednesdays for the winter if people are struggling with their bills and need a place to go and warm up and get some company. The events will be held every Wednesday from November 2<sup>nd</sup> until the end of February. From 9am &#8211; 2pm there will be complimentary hot drinks served in their café, from  12.30 &#8211; 2pm there will be Hot and tasty soup and a roll, from 2pm onwards complimentary hot drinks and homemade cakes, and from 3pm &#8211; 6pm a family after-school club with space for homework, story time, games, films and a free hot meal for all.</p>
<p>The church is in Ashley Road, Epsom, KT18 5AQ. People are welcome just to drop in.</p>
<h2>Epsom &amp; Ewell Energy Relief Programme</h2>
<p>And finally thank you to everyone who has supported the Epsom and Ewell Energy Efficiency Programme. The appeal has already raised more than £12,000. If you do not need the £400 Government contribution towards bills this winter, please do donate it to the programme and help those locally who are already struggling with higher bills make their homes more energy efficient.</p>
<p>Details of how to give are at <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/98eeCRO3xsv5ggnEf9CRxP?domain=justgiving.com">https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/epsom-ewell-energy-support-scheme</a></p>

<p>On Friday the new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced what he described as a mini-budget to help deal with the cost of living crisis. The only thing mini about it was the amount of support it provides to the average family and individual in Britain. This completely un-costed budget, will give out the largest tax cuts since 1972, most of which are aimed at the wealthiest in society. That budget in 1972 lead to a short-lived boom, and a much longer bust, with the infamous three-day week and the failure of key services.</p>



<p>The tax cuts in this mini budget, are mainly for the super wealthy, for corporations and for the bankers. The top tax rate of 45p (%) has been completely removed, which is great news for those lucky few that earn over £150,000 a year. Corporation tax increases have been discarded, and the cap on bankers’ bonuses brought in after the financial crisis of 2008 have been scrapped.</p>



<p>But the Tories aren’t content with just giving handouts to the rich, they have also increased the number of Universal Credit recipients who have to actively search for work and attend weekly or fortnightly job centre appointments, if they are working up to 15 hours a week. If they don’t then their benefits will be reduced. Unsurprisingly the mini-budget also attacks trade union rights further, making it harder for working people to strike for the pay and conditions they deserve.</p>



<p>While they have suspended National Insurance increases and cut stamp duty, this support is minute compare to the support for those best off in society. Even in terms of energy bill support, prices being frozen where they are now, simply means they are only twice what they were last year, at the same time that the price for everything else from food to transport is increasing, while wages and benefits remain completely stagnant.</p>



<p>This budget does not serve the needs of the people of Nottingham, it does not help those who need help the most. People earning £20,000 will only save £167 a year. What it will do is drive Britain into an inflationary spiral. It will cause the prices of the goods that residents need to survive to increase further, at a time where benefits and wages are not rising. This will wipe out any gains that residents in the city see from this mini-budget.</p>

<p>The Tories say their budget will stimulate growth; it remains to be seen if it will. What is certain though is that growth in the economy is pointless if it does not lead to increased wages for the average person, if people are not supported to re-skill and obtain jobs in growing sectors, and if people do not have access to suitable affordable housing, whether that’s via home ownership or renting.</p>



<p>The mini budget does nothing to help achieve these aims, Nottingham Labour strongly believe that the budget will not help the people of Nottingham, it will only help a tiny minority of people. A Labour government is needed nationally to give the people of this country and of Nottingham the support and help that they need, and that they deserve.</p>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Semua game di bawah satu atap</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Meskipun kasino darat memiliki katalog permainan yang cukup luas, tidak ada yang mengalahkan variasi dan jumlah pilihan yang tersedia di kasino online. Pengguna bahkan dapat memanfaatkan tren teknologi terbaru dan berjudi di permainan dealer langsung.</p>
<p>Slot Online khas Inggris akan menawarkan hal itu dan jika Anda ingin pengalaman yang sepenuhnya mendalam, kami pasti akan merekomendasikan Anda untuk memeriksanya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pengguna dengan temperamen dan preferensi yang berbeda dapat berharap untuk menemukan sesuatu atau yang lain yang sesuai dengan gaya mereka. Sebagian katalog terdiri dari judul slot termasuk slot 3-gulungan dan 5-gulungan, dan pengguna tidak perlu khawatir kehabisan permainan untuk dicoba.</p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
