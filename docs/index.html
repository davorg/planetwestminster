<p>    I sympathise with the official forecasters at a time of big change in  the economy, with a large fall in output and incomes  stemming from the measures to curb the pandemic. Getting forecasts right when the economy is falling further and faster when the measures go in and recovering faster and more when they are removed than in previous cycles  makes it difficult to get the numbers right. I have had less sympathy with the undue gloom the OPBR put into their November 2020 and March 2021 forecasts, and said at both  timeS I thought they were exaggerating the deficit. So it has proved.</p>
<p>     In November they forecast a deficit of £394 bn for 2020-21.In March this year forecasting the year to end March which had almost ended, they said the deficit would be £354bn, a £40bn fall in four months. Yesterday they announced the provisional outturn at £303bn, £51 bn down on a few weeks ago and £91bn down on November. They point out they were thinking in March of £27bn of losses on loans which have not yet materialised and would not be a new demand for cash or borrowing anyway. Even taking this out it still leaves the forecasts way too gloomy. They underestimated the amount of tax revenue collected, and overestimated state spending. </p>
<p>     I am raising this again because it will have knock on effects on future years. The £51bn revision downwards to the estimated deficit between this March and April is twice as much  as the government now thinks it needs to add to tax revenue in 2024-5 to control the deficit. Could it be that those future years forecasts are also wrong? Might they be too pessimistic, so how necessary is the extra tax? I have other issues with the future tax policy over how you do secure more revenue and what the role of growth is in meeting the state&#8217;s requirements. Even in their own terms, however, the OBR should examine the possibility that they have been too pessimistic for future years, and consider the need for some caution in drawing early policy conclusions for future years from forecast numbers which have recently proved so unreliable. Did they urge a needless or undesirable tax rise?</p>

<p>Yesterday I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate on ‘social care and the Covid-19 outbreak’. For all of us, the tragedy in social care during this pandemic will stay with us for the rest of our lives. Over 41,000 care home residents have died from coronavirus, and a third of all coronavirus deaths have been of people living with dementia. Those with learning disabilities have been six times more likely to die from Covid-19 than the general population, and care workers were twice as likely to die during the first wave, compared to the rest of the population.</p>
<p>We cannot let social care go back to business as usual. The pandemic struck at a time when social care was already overstretched and undervalued. Local authority care budgets have been cut by £8bn in real terms since 2010, and this has pushed many to breaking point.</p>
<p>Now is the time to transform social care services and support. We need a long-term settlement that supports older and disabled people to live the life they choose. We need to transform the pay, terms, training and conditions of the care workforce. And we also need to create real partnerships between the government and families provide unpaid care to loved ones. The government needs to bring forward plans for social care reform, and ensure this important issue does not go unforgotten.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">The emerging story of a proposed European Super League, featuring some of the richest football clubs across Europe, has been a huge international story that has dominated both front and back pages. However, for us here in Tameside, it’s also a really important local story as two of the clubs involved are Manchester City and Manchester United.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">The exact details of the league and the possible consequences for the breakaway clubs – and the game more broadly – are still somewhat unclear. What is clear, though, is that this move has not gone down well. And it’s very understandable why. These proposals aren’t about football as a sport, they’re about football as a business. To put it bluntly, it’s about greed.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">These teams aren’t necessarily the best clubs in the world – Arsenal are barely in the top half of the Premier League at time of writing – they are getting together because of money. They have large international fanbases and some of the most famous players in the world, so they bring in huge amounts in merchandising and TV rights. They were purchased by their owners as lucrative business opportunities, not as football clubs with histories stretching back generations and deep roots in their communities.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Put plainly, from a purely business perspective, their owners can make a lot more from a big game with Barcelona or AC Milan than they can with a mid-week FA cup tie with Burnley or Accrington Stanley. They can sell more tickets and make millions in TV rights. But that’s not what football is about. The joy of football comes partly from the drama and unpredictability of the game. A league where certain teams can never get relegated loses this completely and is instead quite nakedly an attempt to squeeze as much money as possible out of the game.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Depending on how the FA, the Premier League, UEFA and others react, this could have huge implications for the game at all levels in England. And it matters for our community right here in Tameside – these are our clubs and these proposals run the risk of pulling apart the sport right down to the grassroots level.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">As a Man City fan, I am disappointed that they have gone down this road and hope that the owners – and those of the other clubs – reconsider this. Football is about so much more than just the money that can be made, it’s about the love of the game and the special link between the clubs and the communities that founded and nurtured them. The clubs involved in the Super League would do well to remember this.</p>

<p>This week South Lakes MP and Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Radiotherapy, Tim Farron quizzed NHS England bosses on their plan to tackle the cancer backlog.</p>
<p>At a meeting of MPs and peers, Tim urged Dame Cally Palmer and Professor Peter Johnson from the NHS Cancer Programme to come clean about the number of patients who have missed out on treatment over the past year and to act to catch up with the treatment backlog.</p>
<p>Experts warn that failure to deal with the backlog of people needing cancer treatment could lead to 35,000 excess cancer deaths.</p>
<p>However last month the Cancer Taskforce, the body responsible for kickstarting the recovery of cancer services, was disbanded by NHS England and the Government.</p>
<p>Speaking after the meeting Tim said: <em>"I'm grateful to Dame Cally Palmer and Professor Peter Johnson for meeting with us to discuss the impact of this pandemic on cancer services.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"We are sleep walking into a cancer crisis and the lack of action from the Government has left cancer clinicians and patients in shock.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"If we are to prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths then we need to be treating the cancer crisis like the vaccine roll out, with a dedicated minister put in charge alongside serious investment."</em>

              <h3>Chi Onwurah (Newcastle upon Tyne Central)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Chi Onwurah says : &#8220;The UK has a proud tradition in science and innovation and Labour supports high-ambition science, but Tory secrecy plans mean the new agency risks being a front for sleaze, threatening UK science.”</p>
<p>She warns against Tory sleaze threat to science as Conservatives plan to exempt new agency from Freedom of Information and procurement rules</p>
<p>Labour has warned that the Government’s new taxpayer-funded research and invention agency risks being a front for “sleaze in science” if the Conservatives plough ahead with their plan to give the agency a blanket exemption from FOI and procurement rules.</p>
<p>Despite the scandal currently engulfing the Government, Labour fears Ministers are failing to learn any lessons – with new agencies being established but exempt from oversight, risking opening the door to further cronyism.</p>
<p>The creation of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) has been welcomed by Labour but not so the Government’s plans to “remove the burden” of FOI requests and allow ARIA to circumvent procurement laws to “quickly access suppliers”.</p>
<p>The US science agency DARPA, on which ARIA is modelled, is subject to FOI and procurement rules. When asked what the key characteristic of ARIA should be, DARPA’s Acting Director             Peter Highnam answered “Honour in Public Service” – and made clear that oversight and accountability are important parts of DARPA’s success.</p>
<p><strong>Labour has put down amendments, being debated this week, that would ensure ARIA is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accountable to the public and media through Freedom of Information requests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject to oversight and existing procurement rules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accountable to Parliament through Science Select Committee oversight</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accountable to Parliament by reporting on tolerance of failure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accountable to Parliament with regard to national security through a report to the Intelligence and Security Committee when asked</strong></p>
<p>Labour would extend the FOI Act to cover public contracts won by private bodies, expanding rather than restricting the current rules.</p>
<p>Another Bill currently making its way through Parliament also demonstrates the Government’s failure to learn lessons on the need for oversight.</p>
<p>The National Security and Investment Bill, which will establish a new government unit inside BEIS that could block takeovers on national security grounds, currently does not allow for oversight by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Government has argued that the BEIS Select Committee can provide oversight – despite members lacking the security clearance to see the intelligence information on which a decision to call in or stop an investment would be made.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher’s former Defence Secretary said this oversight “is a serious gap, and we could well pay the price for it in the future”.</p>
<p>Chi Onwurah MP, Labour’s Shadow Science Minister, said:</p>
<p><strong>“The ongoing sleaze scandal engulfing government makes clear why transparency and accountability for government agencies is so important.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“We cannot allow cronyism to sully science, with privileged access and contracts for mates, creating a two-tier science community. Everyone should benefit from the creation of ARIA, which could play a big role in scientific progress if it is open, accountable and driven by an agreed mission.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“A blanket exemption from FOI and procurement regulations cannot be justified and has no precedent in the US. The UK has a proud tradition in science and innovation and Labour supports high-ambition science, but Tory secrecy plans mean the new agency risks being a front for sleaze, threatening UK science.”</strong></p>

<p>I am pleased to be able to follow the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson), with whom I share membership of the commission. I am proud to be a commissioner and I am grateful to the chairman of the commission for his important statement today. I am also proud of the 1,200 people who work in 150 countries around the world tending the memorials, commemorations and gravestones of the many who served and lost their lives for the protection of this country and our values.</p>

<p>Over 100 years ago, the War Graves Commission was established with the specific remit to commemorate the first world war dead of the then British empire and to do so defined by the principle of equality of treatment in death, whatever their rank, religion or race. This happened in Europe and I am not proud that this did not happen across Africa, the middle east and India. I join my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North in welcoming the report we commissioned in December 2019, a month following the Channel 4 programme presented by the right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) and featuring the work of Professor Michèle Barrett. The programme acted as a catalyst for this report, based on detailed research through available archives. I can confirm that this issue has been and is being taken extremely seriously within the commission. We are committed to ensuring that we right the historical wrongs of the past. The commission has been working over the last 20 years to ensure that we correct errors or omissions as we find them and that is what we will do on the back of this report.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has confirmed that he will hold the commission to account in delivering the detailed action plan that it has agreed to address the recommendations made by the special committee. However, does he agree that, while we cannot right the wrongs of 100 years ago, the commission can and should recognise that mistakes were made, apologise for them—as he has just done—and commit to doing what we can, where we can, now to renew our commitment to equality in commemoration with all communities of the former British empire touched by both world wars, where this report reveals that that did not take place?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1539">Mr Wallace (Secretary of State for Defence) </a></h3>

<p>My right hon. Friend is right to point out the determination of the existing commission—and over the last 20 years—to correct things as it finds them. This is one of those times where it has exposed things going way back. He is also absolutely right that, when you go around the world, you see that that network of people do an amazing job. It is extraordinary where you find in the world, almost like an oasis, well-kept areas of commemoration. You are often surprised that we were even there in the first place and, even now, they are kept and looked after. Some of the volunteers and some of the paid employees do an extremely good job as well.</p>

<p>On the funding, as I said to the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson), I will absolutely stand by to make sure that we find the available funding to deliver this. In return, I ask my right hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Philip Dunne) to make sure that these things are properly dealt with, looked at and examined and that they are in accordance with the report’s recommendations and further subsequent recommendations.</p>

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">East Riding College welcomed Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, to its Flemingate campus in Beverley this week for a ‘hard-hat tour’ of its brand-new Institute of Technology (IoT).</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The tour allowed the local MP to view the progress of the college’s Institute of Technology, which is currently in the initial stages of construction. The facility is part of the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Institute of Technology and is one of only 12 such institutes across the country as part of a Government pilot.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The institute will provide specialist accommodation for higher-level engineering, construction and computing courses, in an effort to bring industry and education closer together to address areas suffering from ’skills gaps’.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The project has been supported by the Government’s Local Growth Fund, secured through the former Humber Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP). The fund is now being managed by the Hull &amp; East Yorkshire LEP.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Graham said, “It was very encouraging to see the new development on Flemingate in Beverley in the initial stages of construction. It’s great to see the Government’s investment into my constituency made real, in the form of bricks and mortar, showing how we’re working to boost economic growth through investment into skills and infrastructure.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“Mike and his team at the college have worked incredibly hard to give their students a world-class education even in the midst of a pandemic and I look forward to East Riding College continuing their sterling work at their new facilities.”</span></span></p>

<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Mike Welsh, Principal at East Riding College, added: “I am delighted Graham is supportive of the development and I was pleased to be able to share our progress so far.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“We have worked with the LEP and our IoT partners from across the North to secure the funding to be able to establish the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Institute of Technology, to benefit our students and the regional economy.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“The institute at East Riding College represents an investment in higher-level technical engineering, construction and computing skills in the heart of East Yorkshire, providing our students with the opportunity to enter the jobs market with the higher-level skills employers need.”</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Yorkshire and Humber IoT brings investment of around £12million of capital funding into the region, which will be invested in industry-standard equipment and facilities to provide advanced technical training. It will help to enhance students’ employment opportunities and improve the number of suitably qualified candidates in the technical and professional jobs market.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Yorkshire and Humber IoT has already received significant levels of employer support with digital and engineering businesses ViSR, CATCH, Skipton Building Society, GB Recruitment and ENGIE Fabricom each signing up as employer partners. They have been involved in designing the curriculum, supported by research from the IoT’s university partners, the University of Hull and the University of York St John.</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="eop"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Other colleges involved in the IoT consortium include Askham Bryan College, Bishop Burton College, Craven College, Scarborough TEC, Selby College and York College.</span></span></p>

<p><br>It’s here. At last. The start of reopening. We can get our hair cut, try on clothes in a shop before we buy them and, yes, go to the pub (but wrap up warm!).</p>



<p>We’ve been here before of course, as we’ve emerged from previous lockdowns, tier restrictions and what-have-you-s. But this time feels different. It’s not just that the latest lockdown happened in the long, dark winter months, or that we’re all so weary after a full year of pandemic. This feels different because now there’s hope. The vaccine means this ought to be the last time we take this journey, and good riddance to all that.</p>



<p>The feeling is captured in a rather beautiful film by local filmmaker Sally Low. It’s about Weston coming back to life as 14 of our local shops prepare to re-open (it’s on the SuperWeston facebook page) and, if you haven’t seen it, it’s three-and-a-quarter minutes you won’t regret.</p>



<p>It’s a useful reminder of what getting back to normal will mean for stores or local firms and the people they employ. It’s particularly important because, like High Streets everywhere, central Weston was fighting a battle against online shopping and out-of-town shopping malls before anyone had ever heard of Coronavirus. Lockdown gave online retail a huge push forward and no-one really knows how we will use High Streets from now on. Will we rush back to bricks and mortar town centre shops, or not? We stopped a massive expansion at Cribbs Causeway that would have taken almost £40million from central Weston a few years back, but Sally Low’s film brings our town centre to life: the sounds and the sights, the architecture and beautiful buildings, the people and care they put into the coffee they serve or passion for the products they plan to sell.</p>



<p>So let’s shop local and enjoy normality again. It can’t come soon enough!</p>

<p>Speaking about the proposed Greville Road layout changes, Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“I am aware of the considerable interest in the scheme and have been in open communication with residents and local road users alike. It is my sincere hope that as many people as possible took part in the consultation exercise undertaken by Bristol City Council.</p>
<p>“It’s important that consultations of this type not only listen to the views requested, but also reach out to those who feel the language or supporting documentation is not sufficient. I am pursuing this very issue with the Council presently.</p>
<p>“Traffic management schemes, be them large or small, should hold the primary focus of reducing and not simply displacing vehicle movements. It makes very little sense if any plan increases congestion and pollution on alternate routes. Liveable Neighbourhoods are not just one road and decisions should be undertaken with that in mind.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/04/21/statement-on-greville-road-layout-proposals/">Statement on Greville Road layout proposals</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

This has the effect of increasing the number of unemployed claimants. In addition to this, as part of the government’s response to Coronavirus (COVID-19), a number of enhancements were introduced to Universal Credit.

We are not out of the woods yet and the government lacks a clear vision to rebuild our country. I will be working hard alongside Labour colleagues in Parliament and with services across the constituency to ensure that areas like ours have the resources needed to truly build back better.”</em></strong></p></div></div></div>

<p>Cllr Adele Williams has made a submission to the Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee Inquiry on long term funding of adult social care and used it as an opportunity to reiterate calls for a fair, adequate and sustainable system for funding adult social care services.<br> <br>The Housing, Communities and Local Government select committee has launched an inquiry focusing on   how adult social care should be funded in the long-term and to understand how Covid-19 has impacted the sector. Fair, adequate and sustainable funding for adult social care is an issue Cllr Williams has been raising for a number of years and the pandemic has accelerated an existing problem, increasing demand faster than expected.  There is an urgent need for a more sustainable long term funding settlement for adult social care.</p>



<p>In
submitting a response to the Inquiry Cllr Adele Williams highlighted the unfair
nature of the current funding model on places like Nottingham, saying “<em>The
income that can be raised locally is lower where the levels of deprivation, and
therefore need, are higher, meaning that this is not an adequate response&nbsp;
to the issue &#8211; but one which hits local taxpayers hard.”<br>
<br>
</em>The current approach by Government to fund social care has been to put on
an additional 3% onto council tax, called the social care precept, solely to
fund costs in that area. In Nottingham the Government’s additional 3% has
increased council tax for each band in the following way:</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>
  <strong>Council <br>
  Tax Band</strong>
  </td><td>   <strong>Government’s 3% social care precept £</strong>   </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>A</strong>
  </td><td>
  <strong>£36.17</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>B</strong>
  </td><td>
  <strong>£42.19</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>C</strong>
  </td><td>
  <strong>£48.22</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>D</strong>
  </td><td>
  <strong>£54.25</strong>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  <strong>E</strong>
  </td><td>
  <strong>£66.31</strong>
  </td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><em>Continuing in her submission, Cllr Williams said </em>“A plan to resource social care adequately and sustainably is long overdue. Local taxation is not the answer and the current situation is not a fair or sufficient solution to meet the gap in funding that is widely acknowledged. I would support funding adult social care through general and progressive taxation whilst retaining the role of the local authority who are best placed to promote an asset and strengths based approached given the many and various intersections we have with citizens’ lives.“<br><br> It is  hoped that this inquiry will help produce a fair, sustainable and long term funding system for adult social care. The Government has repeatedly promised to produce a plan, <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/pensions/2019/07/25/prime-minister-vows-to-fix-social-care-crisis/">including Boris Johnson on the day he became Prime Minister</a>, but no such plan has materialised. <br><br></p>

<p>Just 7% of 18-25 year olds have registered for a postal vote in the West Midlands, the lowest rate in the country. This is in comparison to those aged over 65 where the rate jumps to 23%. </p>
<p>With less than half of 18-25-year-olds voting at the 2019 General Election, turnout among young people is expected to be historically low at the May elections amid the pandemic.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “In my constituency alone, there are three universities, with collectively more than 55,000 students. However, even with this large student population, the West Midlands has the lowest voter registration of young people by post than anywhere else in the country. </p>
<p>“At 7% this is staggeringly low and after the devastating year that many students and young people have had, it’s imperative that they make their voices heard.” </p>
<p>Preet has said that young people must be at the heart of Britain’s recovery from this crisis, with successive Conservative governments weakening Britain’s foundations and robbing too many young people of the opportunities they deserve. </p>
<p>Labour warns that Government inaction on postal voting threatens UK democracy and public health and is calling for councils to receive dedicated Government support for postal vote sign up efforts ahead of the deadline for postal vote registration in England on 20th April. </p>
<p>With those aged 18 and older due to be vaccinated by 31 July in England, many young people unlikely to be vaccinated by election day.  </p>
<p>Preet continued, “Young people have played a central role in our country’s response to this crisis, with many volunteering to support the most vulnerable in our communities and fighting as key workers on the front line to protect our families. The Tories continue to treat young people as an afterthought in this crisis – these are our workers of the future. </p>
<p>“Young people are not expected to be vaccinated ahead of the May polls, which makes postal vote sign-up critical. In the Midlands, we have some really important elections with the hopes of a new West Midlands Mayor in Liam Byrne and a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner in Simon Foster, the region has a real opportunity to change its future and make it a bright one for everyone who lives and works here.” </p>

<p>Angus MacNeil has today repeated the call for the trial of the MV Pentalina given the news that the MV Loch Seaforth is suspended until at least the end of April.</p>



<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil said:</p>



<p>“Given the breakdown of the MV Loch Seaforth and the challenges we will again face on the west coast of Scotland on the CalMac ferry routes it is imperative that the MV Pentalina is tested and trialled to see if it is a viable ferry for use on the routes.</p>



<p>“We would be in a hugely dire situation now if another ferry broke down. The current situation is bad enough but to know there is a ferry sitting idly by is frustrating. Between the Government, Transport Scotland and CMAL the decision has not been made to trial the MV Pentalina to see what it can do, it is very frustrating indeed.</p>



<p>“Now is the time for action. I would call on the Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, to urgently intervene to make sure that the Pentalina is brought into the equation.”</p>

<p>My thoughts are with the workers and their families, who will be devastated that it has come to this, in spite of the fact that in meetings with management, the workforce representatives and Unite the Union rep made forceful arguments for keeping the factory open. </p>



<p>It seemed to us that it was all a foregone conclusion. </p>



<p>For a year now, we have been asking the UK Government for a specific Aviation Sector Covid Package, because everyone can see that the sector has been very badly hit, and that any recovery depends on decisions by numerous governments and operators, and such a deal could have could have made all the difference. </p>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Worcester’s MP has paid tribute to HRH the late Duke of Edinburgh and recalled his visit to the faithful city during the Queen’s diamond jubilee in 2012 to open the Hive. The Worcester MP, Robin Walker has spoken of his three meetings with the Prince Philip and how he always showed a dynamism, wit and kindness.</p>
<p>As Parliament sits today for tributes to be paid to an incredible man at the end of a long and fruitful life, Robin has pointed out how his desire to give young people the best chance in life leaves a lasting legacy. Speaking after the sad news of the Duke Of Edinburgh’s passing, Robin Walker MP said:</p>
<p>“This has been an extraordinary life well lived. As a war hero in the Navy, as the world and our country’s longest living consort to a Queen, as the rock of support for our longest serving monarch in her duties at home and around the world and as a dutiful member of the Royal Family, Prince Philip has made an incredible contribution to our country, to the Commonwealth and its history over well over seventy five years of public service.</p>
<p>“For any individual to live to ninety nine and to keep working into their nineties is remarkable but for someone who has bourne such a burden of public service is even moreso. As we heard the sad news of his passing my first thoughts were with her Majesty the Queen for whom he has been such a source of strength. I know that my constituents across the faithful city will be thinking of the Royal Family and all his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren as we join them in mourning.”</p>
<p>“I was very lucky to have met the Duke on a number of occasions and on each he had the capability to light up a room. I first met him when I was a small child of eight or nine at the Royal Welsh show when my father was Secretary of State for Wales, I had been carefully primed to address him as your Royal Highness but in the excitement of the moment I completely forgot to do so. He was charm personified and made no fuss but joked with me in such a friendly matter that I was immediately put at ease. Many years later I was invited as newly elected MP to a palace garden party at Buckingham Palace and he was again laughing and joking all the way around the visitors there, I told him that my office was in Old Scotland Yard and he explained that it took its name from where the Kings of Scotland used to stay on their visits to London, then joked “and sometimes we let them go again afterwards”. The third time and the most special was during the diamond jubilee year when he and the Queen came to Worcester to open the Hive. Everyone who met him that day attested to a larger than life personality, a great charm and an immediate wit, focused on putting people at their ease. I now realise more than ever what an incredible privilege it was to be presented both to the sovereign and to such a remarkable man who has been her strength and support. I also know from my work in Northern Ireland that so many places all over our United Kingdom have fond memories of his visits.”</p>
<p>“The whole country owes this extraordinary man a debt of gratitude for his service but also for his remarkable legacy. His creation of the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme for young people has created so many memorable experiences and done so much to support young people in undertaking volunteering, learning about the great outdoors and building character and resilience. In a very real way his legacy will live beyond him in so many lives enhanced and people inspired. Whilst as a Minister of State, I will not have the opportunity to speak in today’s commons debate, I am looking forward to hearing the tributes from the Prime Minister and others who speak today and I consider it a privilege to have served in the Government and the Parliament of the second Elizabethan age that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has done so much to shape.”</p>

<p>As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.</p>



<p>We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.</p>



<p>While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Please don&#8217;t hesitate to&nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.</p>



<p><strong>Birmingham Coronavirus Update</strong></p>



<p>Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:</p>



<ul><li>Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group</li><li>Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE</li><li>The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household</li><li>Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&#8217;s handling of the pandemic</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.</p>



<p>Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>You can read the full letter <a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Support for a nurses pay rise</strong></p>



<p>Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all they&#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Celebrating St Patrick&#8217;s Day</strong></p>



<p>This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.</p>



<p>Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.</p>



<p>I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fighting to safeguard employment</strong></strong></p>



<p>Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.</p>



<p>Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.</p>



<p>Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.</p>



<p>You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: <a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs</a></p>

Who would have thought at the beginning of last year that, in only a few months’ time, we’d be in a nation-wide lockdown to protect ourselves from a global pandemic? It’s been tough on everyone – keeping apart from loved ones, not going out to work, studying and learning from home. Businesses have been placed under enormous pressure, many of which are only still going today on account of the generous support the government has provided in the form of staff furloughs and other grants and loans.</p>
<p>Most tragically of all, we all know people who have lost friends and family. And we mourn them all.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also aspects of the last year we will look back on with pride. The way Welwyn Hatfield has pulled together. The resilience our local NHS staff have shown when working at any and all hours in the battle against this virus. Local charities and volunteers like Sarah Jamieson of Resolve, who literally moved in with the homeless people she was helping to find accommodation during lockdown. And, of course, all those involved in the Herculean effort that is our vaccination roll-out, some of whom I had the pleasure of meeting when I had my first jab at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One year and three lockdowns later, the remarkable rollout of our vaccine programme means that we’re now able to look forward to a cautious but final route back to normality. Well over 50% of all adults in the UK have now been vaccinated &#8211; no other major economy in the world has vaccinated its population faster. We know it will take time for things to get back to normal, but thanks to the fortitude of the people of Welwyn Hatfield, as well as the hard work of our scientists, our brilliant NHS workers, our military and the army of volunteers across the entire country, we are embarking upon the journey to recovery.</p>

<p>Judith, alongside Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of the council and Tracy Brabin, candidate for West Yorkshire Mayor, has called for the Government to ensure there is a Northern Powerhouse Rail stop in the city centre.</p>



<p>Representing all three of Bradford&#8217;s Labour MPs, Judith said: &#8220;There is a world out there that would open up with an NPR stop here in Bradford city centre.</p>



<p>“It would increase our opportunities for job search, it would mean our businesses thrive.</p>



<p>“It’s a massive deal for Bradford, I can’t think of anything bigger at the moment.”</p>

			<p>As Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, I welcome Dame Julie Walters’ support in calling on the Government to deliver on its election promise to double funding for dementia research.</p>
<p>This comes as Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK reveals 94% of dementia researchers are very concerned progress is at risk due to fewer funding opportunities. While new polling from the charity has highlighted that UK adults think the pledge made during the 2019 election is important, very few believe government will follow through on its word.</p>
<p>This week the UK’s leading dementia research charity has revealed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over three quarters (77%) of the public believe the Government’s pledge to increase its funding for dementia research to over £160 million a year is either still important (59%) or more important (18%) since the coronavirus outbreak.</li>
<li>One in five people (18%) think it is even more important because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen people with dementia among the hardest hit.</li>
<li>Despite this, only 7% of people believe the Government will deliver on the promise made during the 2019 election.</li>
<li>Yet the charity says the funding is more critical than ever before, as a separate survey shows one in five researchers are considering leaving, or have already left, dementia research due to COVID-19 &#8211; while more than a third (34%) are considering leaving research altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am delighted to see Dame Julie pressing the Government to keep the promise it made to the public.  I wrote to the Prime Minister in November urging him to keep his promise on the dementia ‘moonshot’ and also to the Chancellor last month, ahead of the Budget.  Unfortunately neither have yet replied and I share the concern of those surveyed that the Government will break its promise.</p>
<p>Like many people, including Dame Julie, I have family experience of dementia – my mother had Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. I know just how important research is into understanding the condition and looking for treatments to prevent, slow, and ultimately cure diseases that cause dementia.</p>
<p>It’s been well over a year since the government pledged to boost dementia research, after this was included in the Conservative 2019 General Election manifesto. But with no indication that this funding is to be delivered, it’s time for action.</p>
<p>While it’s right that the response to the pandemic has had to take priority, dementia is not just the UK but the world’s greatest long-term health crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the lives of people affected by dementia and their carers have been devastated, with a staggering 34,000 people with dementia estimated to have died from coronavirus since March 2020. The search for life-changing dementia treatments has never been more critical.</p>
<p>Our life sciences sector both in academia and industry showed what we can do together in response to Covid-19. In the same way, I believe we can lead the world in finding cures for the diseases which cause dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Dame Julie Walters said: </strong></p>
<p>“As someone who witnessed the effects of dementia growing up, I am proud to be standing with the tens of thousands of people who are calling on government to deliver on its election promise to double investment into researching the condition. My grandmother had vascular dementia and she lived with us when we were kids. We didn’t really understand her symptoms, but we all loved her to bits. I still don’t know how my mother coped having to care for her and look after three young children.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that over half of us know someone affected by dementia, yet there are no treatments to slow, stop or prevent it. Far too many families are being forced to experience the pain dementia causes on a daily basis because of the lack of treatments and to put it simply, enough is enough.</p>
<p>“There is an urgent need for research to bring about life-changing treatments for people affected by dementia. With the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on those with the condition, the funding promised by government is more critical now than it ever has been and it’s clear the public agrees. I’d urge everyone to sign this petition, so we can make it clear to government that we will not let their promise be cast aside.”</p>

<p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It&#8217;s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recently coordinated a cross party <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20">letter</a> with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.</p>



<p>As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.</p>



<p>I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.</p>



<p>The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>

<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
