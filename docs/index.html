            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Let me make clear I strongly oppose the brutal Russian invasion and their resort to medieval sieges with modern bombs and artillery raining down on civilians and defenders. I do not post here the few submissions I get which slavishly follow Russian propaganda denying atrocities or blaming others for the  deaths and destruction we can see from reputable media sources.</p>
<p>I also strongly support NATO policy to take every precaution to avoid this becoming a NATO/Russian war.  Whilst NATO would overwhelm Russia there could be much larger loss of life and destruction  in Ukraine and the conflict would be widened by Russia into NATO countries before they lost. NATOs aim should be to encourage settlement between the parties whilst helping Ukraine resist Russia&#8217;s unprovoked aggression.</p>
<p>The U.K. as a leading member of NATO needs to stick with NATO policy. In the end like all wars there has to be a truce and preferably a peace settlement which can only come from talking. The U.K. will not play an important role in that as it falls to Russia and Ukraine as the combatants to decide what compromises they will make to end the fighting. It may  take a neutral intermediary like Israel to help them.</p>
<p>Russia seems to want to gain legal title to Crimea and the bits of Donbas it already influenced. It wants to add a land corridor from Russia to Crimea. It wants Ukraine to pledge it will not join either the EU or NATO. Maybe it still wants a change of Ukrainian government. It does not look as if Russia can either easily conquer the whole country or govern significant parts of it by military occupation now it has united most Ukrainians outside Crimea and Donbas against it. Maybe Russia still  thinks it can get unconditional surrender by starving and bombing people out of cities, but it still leaves it with too few troops there to keep down a population of more than 40 million.</p>
<p>Ukraine wants the Russian army to exit and wants to restore democratic government to the whole country. These positions are so far apart because Russia still looks as if she thinks she can at greater cost in lives and destruction claim more territory and the Ukrainians have growing confidence they can make further conquest difficult for the Russians.</p>
<p>There will only be a truce or peace if Russia gives up many of her imperial ambitions and if Ukraine offers Russia some way of climbing down that Putin can accept. Unpleasant  though that is  to the Ukraine side a lot of lives rest on it. It looks to an outside observer who does not have to do any fighting  as if Ukraine will not be able to join the EU or NATO any time soon. It  looks  as if Crimea would in a free vote vote to be Russian. Maybe these are building blocks for a ceasefire. The EU and US  involvement in removing an elected President of Ukraine in 2014 for being anti closer links with the EU triggered military responses from Russia  which have just got a lot worse.Whilst President Macron seeks a ceasefire the  EU issues a Council statement about Ukraine&#8217;s European EU future.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started the week with International Women’s Day and the theme has continued throughout the week! I was pleased to contribute to the debate on Government support for breastfeeding. We know that the first few months of a child’s life are crucial for their later development and that parents need support in their choices for their children. I welcome the Minister’s commitment to additional funding for breastfeeding support, but it is clear that the cuts, particularly to Sure Start, were a really bad false economy, with centres having closed, parents lacking support and advice, and children being let down. Disadvantaged mothers are more likely to have babies of low birth weight, and low birth weight is associated with raised blood pressure and coronary heart disease, as well as reduced educational attainment, qualifications and employment. Sure Start centres help to level up and supporting them would be a really easy, quick win for the Government to support women in optimal infant nutrition, particularly breastfeeding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to speak at a Labour Women Bristol event for IWD on my experience as a woman in politics. We hear a lot about the abuse that women face online, and many female politicians experience the most appalling attacks. It is so important that we tackle the abuse that women face and build better support networks because women in politics ensures the representation that we need. The better our representation, the more diverse our representation and the better we can represent all our constituents and ensure that the UK is a country that promotes equality and tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Zelensky of Ukraine addressed the House of Commons this week in a historic moment. It was incredibly moving to watch and listen to him talk about the resolve of Ukrainians to fight for their freedom. We must stand with them in any way we can – we must do more to help care for the people fleeing this terrible violence. I know constituents who have been affected and who are seeking to be reunited with their loved ones in safety. The UK Government must act immediately to ensure that there is a swift and reliable route for refugees to be able to come to the UK. It truly is the least we can do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to join a meeting on the right to maintain contact organised by Rights for Residents, the Relatives and Residents Association, and John’s Campaign. It is so important for the mental wellbeing of patients in care that they are able to easily maintain contact with their loved ones. We have seen during the Covid pandemic the heart-breaking impact that being separated from loved ones has, and that is heightened when someone cannot fully understand why. These organisations are calling for recognition in law of the role that family plays in the lives of vulnerable people in care. Health and Social Care goes beyond simply what happens in care settings – it’s how we incorporate care into everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fantastic to visit Bridge Farm Primary School on Friday to meet the pupil parliament and to discuss parental engagement, the environment, rights respecting schools, and pupil voice. I often find talking with children reminds you of the important facts and the issues that impact our children. It was a pleasure to meet the pupil parliament and to hear about what is important to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/03/11/weekly-round-up-20/">Weekly Round-Up</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p>This year only one of 16 suppliers, reviewed for the Which Energy Survey, received a Recommended Provider award.</p>



<p>That means only one achieved the standards and consideration for consumers that might be expected.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not that surprised, given recent experiences I&#8217;ve had while attempting to contact the company that came bottom of the league.</p>



<p>Recommended providers are those whose approach helps customers and prioritises things like good customer service and accessibility.</p>



<p>Many of these businesses now opt for online communication as their main means of contact for consumers. That&#8217;s fine for those with access to computers and comfortable with digital communication and when there are no complicated problems but what about those who struggle, especially older people and those without smart phones?</p>



<p>Several suppliers are keen to point out they offer a free 0808 number but it&#8217;s not unusual to wait 25 minutes for a call to be answered and I&#8217;ve come across far too many examples of people being passed from pillar to post.</p>



<p>I recognise the price of energy is rising dramatically due to increases in the cost of gas and oil and that the problem is getting worse because of Putin&#8217;s brutal invasion of Ukraine. However, I&#8217;m not sure that explains why companies need to put up their standing charges.</p>



<p>How exactly do they relate to rising costs on the world market? Could it be that they&#8217;re taking advantage and hope we won&#8217;t notice?</p>



<p>Some issues may be beyond the government&#8217;s control but people don&#8217;t understand why the Chancellor is adding to their eventual bills by loaning money to energy companies which he then expects customers to repay while oil and gas giants enjoy record profits and avoid any windfall tax.</p>



<p>The government needs to look at what more can be done. Ofgem, the regulatory body for Gas and Electricity Markets, are also quite hard to contact by phone and I couldn&#8217;t find any details on their website about what they&#8217;re doing to improve overall services for customer, particularly accessibility and customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something very wrong when only one in 16 suppliers can achieve Recommended Provider status.</p>

              <h3>Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has expressed his exasperation at the attitude of the UK Home Office as regards to refugees coming from war-torn Ukraine.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has been contacted by a high number of constituents across the islands throughout this week who are disgusted by the UK Home Office’s heartless attitude to refugees.</p>



<p>He said: “I am dismayed at the fanatical attitude towards refugees displayed by the Home Office. It seems to hold very extremist views. The UK is alone in Europe and no other country is doing what the UK is doing.</p>



<p>“Personally, I have been working with a family in Lewis trying to get relations back and despite the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, telling me that there was a task-force coming in a week last Tuesday and that she was dealing with the matter personally, nothing has changed materially for these people.</p>



<p>“In fact, in the Chamber I had cross words with the Home Secretary because of the weakness of her response to what is an extremely serious situation.</p>



<p>“It angers me daily that there is still no progress for people and indeed, some are becoming so dismayed and disheartened with the UK’s approach that they have decided not to come.</p>



<p>“At one stage we had the situation that if people had begun the Visa process with their appointment in Warsaw, if they wanted to change their appointment to Dublin, they would have to restart the entire Visa process.</p>



<p>“This may have ameliorated somewhat in the last few days, but it is still far below what every other decent European country is doing.</p>



<p>“The situation is doubly worse in the UK in that the principal opposition party – the Labour Party &#8211; are also in the extreme fanatical wing and want to get people who are fleeing for their lives to get down to the pen-pushing bureaucracy of acquiring a visa.&nbsp; Both need a check with reality and a check with decency.</p>



<p>“People who have to get out of a war-torn country should be welcomed with open arms. They should not be kept out in the cold, as was literally seen in -5C in some British institutions in Poland on their way to an appointment at UK application centres which were ill-prepared to deal with the amount of people.</p>



<p>“If Ireland, with a population of 5m, can let in far more people than the UK which has a far greater population, then the Tory UK Government and the principal opposition Labour Party, need to have a good, hard look at what they are doing.</p>



<p>&#8220;At least some compassion here in the islands, outside the Westminster political bubble of Tory and Labour, is that people are asking when refugees are coming and are looking to help. The Westminster situation is far different to the attitude of normal people.</p>



<p>“The reason they are coming to Ireland is because Ireland is independent. Scotland isn’t independent and that is why we are dealing with the extremists and the fanatics at the disorganised UK Government Home Office.”</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Preet Kaur Gill MP will stand unopposed as the Labour candidate for the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency at the next General Election, it has been confirmed today (Thursday 10th March 2022). <br />
 <br />
Edgbaston Labour confirmed today that the sitting MP had been successful in the selection process, receiving the support of all branches and affiliates and therefore unanimously re-selected by the party. <br />
 <br />
As part of the selection process, all Labour branches chose to reselect Ms Gill as well as 33 trade union branches and affiliates including the Co-Operative Party, Irish Society, Unite, GMB, Unison, Usdaw, Aslef, Jewish Labour Movement, Birmingham Fabians and the Socialist Health Association.<br />
 <br />
Welcoming the announcement from the party, Preet Kaur Gill MP said: “I am delighted that party members and the wider Labour movement have put their trust in me once again to be their representative for our constituency.<br />
 <br />
“Being the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, where I grew up, has been the greatest honour of my life. Since being elected I have voted more than 745 times, asked 1,700 parliamentary questions and spoken in over 200 debates. Time and again, I’ve worked hard to represent local residents on the issues that matter most to them.<br />
 <br />
"During the pandemic, casework soared with so many people writing to me and calling to ask for help. Over the last four years, I’ve supported more than 31,000 people with a range of issues. I am particularly proud to have been named the Patchwork Foundation’s MP of the year in 2020 which recognised the work I have done in creating a mentoring programme for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and advancing the concerns of minority groups.<br />
 <br />
“But it is the successes I’ve had with local campaigns that brings me the greatest pride. Alongside Labour supporters and local residents, we protested to keep our banks open on Harborne High Street. I have worked with the police on Saif Lodge, to ensure that the first example in the country of substandard exempt accommodation was permanently closed. I’ve also worked hard in Birmingham to ensure we improve the state of our roads. Now that the council has put an end to the disastrous Tory PFI contract with Amey, I have worked with our excellent Labour councillors to see that Edgbaston constituency gets a considerable proportion of the £100 million investment to repair and resurface our roads.<br />
 <br />
“But there is so much more for me to do for communities across our constituency. I will continue to work tirelessly to represent the interests of everyone and look forward to contesting the next General Election as Labour’s candidate”.</p>

<p>South Lakes MP Tim Farron has secured a massive victory in his campaign to stop plans to merge Lancaster and Preston's hospitals onto a single site.</p>
<p>These plans were first announced by the Conservative Government back in 2020, prompting fears it could lead to even longer journeys to access emergency care for patients in the South Lakes.</p>
<p>Tim raised the issue with health ministers in meetings and on the floor of the House and earlier this year presented an 8,000-strong petition to the Department for Health, calling for the plans to be scrapped.</p>
<p>But this afternoon, a press release from the Lancashire and South Cumbria Health and Care partnership revealed that the plans have now been "discounted".</p>
<p>Commenting on the news this evening, Tim said: <em>"I'm absolutely over the moon that after months and months of pressure, these dangerous plans are now finally in the bin where they belong.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who signed the petition and backed the campaign - this is your victory.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"However, I will be watching the rest of this process like a hawk to make sure that no hospital services are moved from Kendal or Lancaster to Preston."</em>

<p>The horrific Russian invasion of Ukraine has finally displaced the saga of ‘PartyGate’ on the Westminster agenda. </p>



<p>My thoughts are with the people of Ukraine at this terrifying time. And for Ukrainians here who are anxious about their family back home. </p>



<p>On 24 February, I raised my constituent&#8217;s case directly to the Prime Minister.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Waive the visa for Ukraine, 24 February 2022" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lPmGSkn_bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>My question:<em> </em></strong><em>In an earlier response, the Prime Minister suggested that this country would welcome people who were reuniting with family here. I have a constituent who is Ukrainian but a British citizen. She is trying to bring her mother from Ukraine, but has been turned down because she is over 18. Her mother is on her own and has no family, so naturally she is frightened. Will we see a change in the Home Office to enable British citizens who are Ukrainian to bring their vulnerable family here?</em></p>



<p><strong>PM response:</strong> <em>I thank the hon. Lady very much. I think I read out a helpline number in the House on Tuesday. I do not have it with me. There is a number both in Lviv and in this country, but if she could do me the favour of sending me the details, I will take them up.</em></p>



<p>Despite reassurances from the Prime Minister, it took six days of intensive pressure from MPs of all parties to get the Home Office to widen access to family visas to actually include ALL immediate family members. Myself and my staff raised my constituent&#8217;s case to the Home Office, the Home Secretary Priti Patel, the Minister for Immigration Kevin Foster, and I raised her situation at a number of briefings and meetings that I attended over the past few weeks. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the delay means it will be harder for people to travel across Ukraine because of areas now controlled by the Russian army. Indeed, my constituent&#8217;s mother is now in a city under Russian siege, and Russia continues to breach the ceasefires which are essential for evacuation corridors.</p>



<p>While I welcome the improved visa offer for Ukrainian refugees, the UK Government are still making it more difficult for those fleeing war to come here compared to other countries across Europe, including Ireland, who are welcoming them with open arms.</p>



<p>My SNP colleagues and I continue to implore the UK Government to provide aid and assistance to Ukraine, including pushing for an open simplified visa-free entry for Ukrainian refugees, as in EU and Ireland.</p>



<h2>How you can help:</h2>



<p>Ukraine needs your help and support. I encourage you to donate to charities working on the ground in Poland. These charities can make much better use of cash donations than having to sort through second hand items.

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p>It will not surprise readers that the most pressing issue at Westminster just now is the horrific and unwarranted invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin is a ruthless dictator who is now a war criminal – there can be no doubt of the lengths he will go to get what he wants.</p>
<p>It was a poignant moment in the Chamber of the House of Commons last week when the whole house, political representatives of all parties, rose to give the Ukrainian ambassador, Nadya Prystaiko, a lengthy standing ovation. It was emotional to be able to show solidaritity with his nation in some small way.</p>
<p>As a gesture, it grabbed the media&#8217;s attention and sent a signal to the watching world. It was, however, but a gesture. No matter how heartfelt and profound, it cannot replace the urgent action required by the UK Government to support Ukrainian families.</p>
<p>Ukraine alone cannot halt the Putin led Russian forces from killing more innocent people – they need meaningful support, and they need it now.</p>
<p>I cannot remember ever receiving more emails from constituents on a single subject – thousands of you have been in touch to urge me to lobby the UK Government to do more and ask me what you can do to help. Many of you have been frustrated to watch the lack of haste and meaningful action on sanctions and sanctuary from Boris Johnson and his Government.</p>
<p>While there has been some good work on sanctions, there is an awful lot of wriggle room left for Russian Oligarchs with links to Putin and seemingly little ideas about what to do with any frozen or seized funds.</p>
<p>Loopholes, lasting weeks or months, are being left to allow bad actors to move their dirty money out of the UK, making a mockery of the sanctions process. Why are the Tories allowing this? You&#8217;ll have to make your own mind up on that.</p>
<p>On sanctuary, we have seen the whole of Europe throw open their doors to fleeing refugees, suspending visa requirements for three years, in an inspirational show of common decency and solidarity. Disgracefully, the UK government have thus far refused to mirror this action. Instead, we have to listen to Ministers suggest Ukrainians can apply for &#8216;fruit picking&#8217; visas and their backbench MPs wailing that their constituencies are &#8216;too full&#8217; – telling us they have already &#8216;done their bit&#8217;.</p>
<p>On behalf of the people of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey, I urged the Foreign Secretary to allow us to follow the actions of our European neighbours – she dismissed my appeal.</p>
<p>In contrast, the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has pledged that Scotland is ready to welcome Ukrainian refugees and urges the UK government to waive visa requirements for people seeking refuge.</p>
<p>Here at home, our communities have shown their support for Ukraine in every way possible. From businesses and groups collecting donations to the various vigils and protests, people across the constituency are doing what they can to show solidarity with Ukraine&#8217;s people. They are joined by our wonderful public organisations ready to support refugees seeking safety.</p>
<p>I know many readers are already doing much to help and are keen to do more. An initiative worthy of praise is DEC&#8217;s humanitarian appeal. For those who are able to and wish to contribute £10, text SUPPORT to 70150.</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, joined NHS staff and health leaders to help launch the NHS Parliamentary Awards 2022.</p>
<p>The NHS Parliamentary Awards was launched in 2018 to celebrate the NHS&#8217; 70th Birthday and recognise the outstanding contribution of staff, volunteers and others working within the health and care sector.</p>
<p>Now in its fifth year, the Parliamentary awards have been a massive success, with over 450 Members of Parliament nominating an individual or organisation for an award.</p>
<p>Gwynne, who is also Labour&#8217;s Shadow Minister for Public Health, is now encouraging local residents across Denton and Reddish to get in touch with any teams, individuals or organisations they think deserve recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The NHS Parliamentary Awards are a fantastic initiative, and I&#8217;m really proud to be supporting them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last two years, our NHS has faced incredible pressure, and staff, volunteers and carers have gone above and beyond to get us through the pandemic. These heroes deserve to be recognised and celebrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you know a local person, team or organisation that you think deserves national recognition, please get in touch!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>To submit a nomination, residents are encouraged to email gwynnea@parliament.uk with details. Nominations will close on the 4th of April.</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday, Parliament was honoured to have Ukraine&#8217;s President Volodymyr Zelensky address the House of Commons.</p>
<p>President Zelensky is the first foreign leader to ever address the House of Commons chamber. He made an incredibly moving speech to MPs and Lords in the chamber on the current situation in Ukraine, and the support Ukraine needs to defend itself from Russia&#8217;s terrible invasion. He received two standing ovations.</p>
<p>You can see President Zelensky&#8217;s statement <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28902686-865d-48ea-ba23-90aa2aebd061">here</a> or read it <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-08/debates/22030870000001/Addendum">here.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>In response to President Zelensky&#8217;s statement, the Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said “Labour stands for the unity at home and abroad that will isolate the Putin regime. Labour stands for the toughest sanctions that will cripple the Russian state. Labour stands for providing Ukraine with the arms it needs to fight off its invaders. Labour stands with President Zelensky, with Ukraine, with democracy. Slava Ukraini.”</p>

<p>Readers of last week’s edition of the <em>Barnsley Chronicle </em>will have seen the story of Darfield Councillor Pauline Markham, the victim of a despicable and cowardly attack in a local park, simply for serving the public to the best of her ability. In her own words she summed up the injustice, “I was simply a woman who was walking her dog.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly, Pauline’s story is part of a much wider issue – our collective failure to take violence against women and girls seriously. We’ve seen it locally in the rising instances of girls’ drinks being spiked on nights out, soaring cases of stalking in the last year; and the devastating statistic that 86% of women aged 18-24 in the UK have been sexually harassed.</p>

<p>I am writing to you with information about local help for those affected by the situation in Ukraine as well as how you can contribute to the national fund being collected to support people affected by the War.</p>
<p>A local team has set up a collection centre for local donations in the old H&amp;M unit in the Ashley Centre. That’s the original unit near House of Fraser and not the double floored one which has closed recently. They are in the process of setting up a formal charity to do so, and have an organised plan to move donations out to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their biggest ask right now is for donations of medical supplies, and in particular things like bandages, as well as over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen. If you have items that you do not need, or are willing to buy some and drop them off there, I know that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>They are also asking for donations to help pay for fuel costs to get van loads of supplies to the Polish/Ukrainian border, and are able to take cash or card donations at the centre in Epsom.</p>
<p>If you want to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee/Red Cross national appeal the link to the appeal site is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dec.org.uk">www.dec.org.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>Your donation is being match funded by the Government.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me about providing accommodation locally for Ukrainian refugees. I am in discussions about this at the moment and will provide a further update later in the week.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

<p>On Monday I attended the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-02-28/debates/2c650227-ac66-4819-aeb2-4b2bf74e56d2/DraftGoodsVehicles(LicensingOfOperators)(Amendment)Regulations2022">Second Delegated Legislation Committee</a> to discuss the Statutory Instrument (SI) “The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022, which was laid by the Department of Transport of the UK Government to amend legislation governing the goods vehicle Operator licensing regime. The UK is obliged to implement these changes following commitments included in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) which come into effect this year.</p>
<p>The purpose of this SI is to extend the goods vehicle operator licensing regimes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to include light goods vehicles (LGVs) such as vans and pick-up trucks which weigh more than 2.5 tonnes up to 3.5 tonnes in maximum laden weight alone or combined with a trailer, and which operate internationally for hire or reward.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport Trudy Harrison MP stated that the original SI did not correctly achieve policy aims, because it should only apply to goods vehicles, but one part inadvertently applied to passenger vehicles, and so disrupts the Public Passenger Act 1981.</p>
<p>The Minister had already sent a letter to all members of the committee on Monday morning which stated that she was extremely disappointed that this issue had occurred and the causes are being addressed as a matter of urgency within her department. She also hoped that any issues could be covered in the committee debate.</p>
<p>There was quite a heated exchange between our Labour Shadow Spokesperson Gill Furness and the Minister about the need for this urgent amending SI, without actually stating that the DfT had messed up by not including this in the original SI. We did not oppose the amendment which is necessary to re-align the regulations.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, the main business in the Chamber was consideration of Lords Amendments to the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-02-28/debates/6254EF37-9538-4A42-94DD-7EACBC5EA9E4/PoliceCrimeSentencingAndCourtsBill">Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill</a>, and we had a series of votes which started at 8pm, in which we supported all the Lords Amendments. The last 4 votes were taken at midnight, finishing at 1am, which meant that MPs were trying to get home, or to their London lodgings, an hour after the London tube strike had started. As you are aware the security of MPs has been of concern again following the murders and threats to MPs, but the UK Government did not take this into consideration, and pushed the amendments to a Division so that they could vote against all the Lords Amendments.</p>
<p>Tuesday was dominated by Dydd Gwyl Dewi Sant, St David’s Day.The celebrations started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1498727269493211139?cxt=HHwWhoCsldqgxswpAAAA">choir of primary children</a> from Ysgol Gymraeg Llundain, beautifully dressed in traditional Welsh costumes, who met Welsh MPs and the Speaker in Westminster Hall to serenade us with Welsh songs. The children were absolutely amazing and their teachers were so proud of them. After listening to the beautiful voices of the children, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1498693056400433157?cxt=HHwWioC94Z7ZtswpAAAA">the Speaker raised the Welsh Flag</a> in Parliament Square. It rained throughout the flag ceremony, but we are used to rain in Wales.  Then we attended an Eisteddfod hosted by the Speaker in his official rooms, where we <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1498708393644593158?cxt=HHwWjMCokf7VvcwpAAAA">listened to choristers</a> and speeches.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday I celebrated the forthcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1499360942915686402?cxt=HHwWhMCsia215s4pAAAA">25 years of World Book Day</a> due to take place on 3rd March by attending a drop-in event held in Westminster. The theme was “changing lives through a love of books and shared reading”. The OECD has found that reading for pleasure is the single biggest indicator of a child’s future success, more than family circumstances, parent’s educational background, or income. The National Literary Trust survey indicated that 3 in 5 children said that reading during lockdown made them feel better. Last year 55% of primary school children said that they read more books as a result of World Book Day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I chaired the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-02/debates/c04082cc-a91d-4650-8972-1e4b9bc54790/DraftSocialSecurity(Scotland)Act2018(DisabilityAssistanceAndInformation-Sharing)(ConsequentialProvisionAndModifications)Order2022">Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which discussed The Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (Disability Assistance and Information-Sharing) (Consequential Provision and Modifications) Order 2022, which makes consequential amendments to legislation to provide for the treatment of various social security payments made under the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018. The SI will create a new disability benefit Adult Disability Payment (ADP) which will replace PIP, extend a 50% discount or exemption for road tax, those in receipt of ADP can acquire a driving licence at 16, and can apply to vote by proxy and sign by proxy a petition for the recall of an MP, without the need for attestation of an application. The SI also provides information-sharing between Scottish Ministers and the Secretary of State for Transport (DVLA), in order to implement these provisions. The SI was not opposed.</p>
<p>Wednesday at midday, I attended PMQs, and all MPs gave a very emotional standing ovation to the Ukrainian Ambassador who was in the Public Gallery. There is a Parliamentary rule against applauding in the Chamber, but we clapped for many minutes to show that we support the bravery and resolve of the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister, and its people.</p>
<p>After PMQs I attended a virtual briefing hosted by the New Democracy Project and Labour Friends of Ukraine. We heard from two Russian experts, Lincoln Pigman, a Russian-American fellow at the Foreign Policy Centre, and Dr Jade McGlynn of Oxford University, both of whom have been closely following the developing situation in Ukraine. The event was chaired by Sir Tony Lloyd MP with a speech from Labour Shadow Europe Minister Stephen Doughty MP.</p>
<p>Following on from a joint meeting between the APPG for Sport of which I Chair and the APPG for Mountaineering, chaired by Derek Twigg MP, when we discussed the effects of Brexit on the sport and recreation sectors, I arranged for the UK Government Minister for Sport, Tourism, Heritage, Civil Society and Youth Nigel Huddleston to meet virtually with Tom Cloke, chair of Alpine Sports, which represents: GB Snowsport, Snowsport Scotland, Snow Sport Wales, DSUK, Ski Club of GB, British Association of Ski Instructors, British Association of International Mountain Leaders, British Association of Mountain Guides, Snowsport Industries of GB, Max Nicholls, Policy Officer for the Sport and Recreation Alliance, and myself. Tom explained the loss of revenue of his sector who used to operate in the EU, but cannot now do so, because work permits, local laws and protectionism, and cross-border service provision have raised barriers. Also, there has been a loss of reputation and influence because UK Snowsport bodies are now perceived as being outside the circle of influence in the EU, and relationships which have been developed over many years have been lost. Coaches and athletes cannot perform because they can’t train in the EU states. Insufficient time in the snow with a coach will result in loss of medal results. Tom asked the Minister to consider changing the system to allow: applying for short term work permits; increasing mobility for named seasonal professionals from 90 in 180 days to 180 in 360 days; and UK-EU Youth Mobility Schemes. Max Nicholls stated that there were similar problems with other sports who wish to continue training and participating in the EU, and provided alpine mountain biking and road cycling as examples. The Minister said that he was aware of the situation because he has been approached by many sports in a similar situation, but he would liaise with other Government Departments to assess the current situation, and report back. I thanked the Minister for granting us the meeting and for listening to our concerns.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Back Bench Business Committee granted a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-03/debates/170D494A-BA3E-4909-84C1-B7DA6753F0FA/WelshAffairs#contribution-C191B026-CBFF-4889-92F2-3B7795F63F93">St David’s Day Debate</a> on Welsh Affairs led by Wayne David MP for Caerphilly. Wayne and I went to the same comprehensive school, Cynnfig, and I thanked him for supporting me throughout my time in Parliament. I spoke about my dear friend Hywel Francis, who sadly and tragically passed away on 14th February 2021, and the influence that he had on the history of Neath, South Wales, and beyond. Sometimes words are not enough to express the legacy that Hywel created and I miss him more everyday. I also <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1499730788513951748?cxt=HHwWiMC5wZnNjtApAAAA">took the opportunity</a> to intervene on the Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart to ask him when the UK Government would be releasing the funding for the Global Centre of Rail Excellence which is to be built in Onllwyn, so that we can get on with it. Mr Hart promised to find out the date, so I followed up immediately with a written question.</p>
<p>Back in my Neath constituency, I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/NPT_YS/status/1498677554517000201?cxt=HHwWkoCy3fTSr8wpAAAA">Youthfest celebration of youth services</a> in the Upper Amman Valley, which took place at Cwmgors Rugby Club and Gawain-Cae-Gurwen GCG Community Centre. The Mayor of Neath Port Talbot Council, Cllr John Warman, opened the event, the Welsh Government Minister for Education, Jeremy Miles MS, presented awards to newly qualified youth workers, and I gave a vote of thanks to everyone who had worked so hard to make the day an overwhelming success. There was a full day of superb events including Warriors Martial Arts, Music Workshop with GCG Brass Band, and the famous Organised Kaos Youth Circus. I was delighted to meet members of the Neath Port Talbot Youth Council, Cllr Sonia Reynolds and candidate councillor Sarah Thomas, (both of whom will be standing in the May Local Government elections). I am very grateful to my friend Cllr Arwyn Woolcock, who will be retiring as Cllr for Lower Brynamman at the May elections after 33 years’ service to the residents of the Amman Valley. We will miss his hard work and dedication.</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has won refunds for residents of Ashley Court, Hatfield, who were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire, and then subject to unfair service charges for housing they were unable to reside in.</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p>It has been over a year since the residents of Ashley Court were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time residents, many of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site &#8211; residing in temporary accommodation.</p>



<p>Building work aimed at restoring Ashley Court has also been delayed.</p>



<p>Previously, residents of Ashley Court were billed £225 per month in service charges for housing they had not occupied.</p>



<p>This monthly fee included charges for various services, including a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, which residents were not benefitting from.</p>



<p>In December 2021, local MP Grant Shapps wrote to Sanctuary Housing, the housing association responsible for managing Ashley Court, expressing his concern about “the impact on his constituents” nominally resident there.</p>



<p>Sanctuary Housing responded to Mr Shapps’ letter but at that time did not agree to waive the £225 a month charge.</p>



<p>In February, Mr Shapps wrote to the association once again (below), this time saying that he was putting it “on notice” over its unfair treatment of residents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40879" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40880" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>Following this most recent letter, Sanctuary Housing responded quickly.</p>



<p>In a major victory for the residents, the association apologised, saying that it had got its “approach wrong” regarding Ashley Court, and that it would be refunding service charge payments to residents as appropriate.</p>



<p>The association also said it would refund payments for deceased residents to their respective estates.</p>



<p>Sanctuary Housing stated it would be conducting a “more detailed review” of how the residents of Ashley Court were put in their previous unfair situation and would share its findings with Mr Shapps’ office.</p>



<p>The association agreed to meet with Mr Shapps in March saying that its representative would apologise in person, and that it would put itself on the “appropriate footing” to work with him going forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Councillor Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of the residents of Ashley court, will also attend the meeting.</p>



<p>Cllr Hebden said of the recent good news: “This is a fantastic step forward for the residents. There are other issues to be resolved but if Sanctuary Housing are adopting a new resident-focussed stance then I’m a lot more optimistic”.</p>



<p>Mr Shapps gave his own thoughts on the matter adding: “This is a great result for the residents of Ashley Court, and I’m incredibly happy to have been part of the effort to facilitate it.</p>



<p>“As Councillor Hebden has said, this is a step forward for the residents, and I’m sure that our meeting with Sanctuary Housing will yield further results.</p>



<p>“Putting residents in such an unfair situation was unacceptable, so I’m hoping that this outcome will go some way to putting their minds at ease.” &nbsp;</p>

I want to express my solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also I want to commend those brave Russians who are standing up to Putin’s warmongering. His erratic and irrational behaviour is a serious threat to us all.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Putin’s attack on Ukraine is an unprovoked and unjustifiable outrage that will have tragic consequences for Ukraine, Europe and our world. It is a heinous violation of international law that breaks multiple treaties and commitments, including the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. Putin’s actions should be utterly condemned by all nations. As such, I regret that some countries in the UN Security Council failed to support a UN resolution calling for this yesterday.</em></p>
<p><em>This assault on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must now have serious consequences for Putin and his supporters. I am clear that there can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we depend and have broadly enjoyed since the end of the Second World War.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>We must now match our rhetoric with action. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin and against the Russian Government’s interests, working in a coordinated and unified way with our allies to ensure the Putin regime faces the severest possible consequences for their actions.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The UK sanctions earlier this week have been recognised as far too limited. Yesterday’s additional sanctions are wider reaching but there will undoubtedly need to be more. Some of you have proposed your own sanctions including ‘isolating </em><em>Russia completely’ and ‘stop buying oil, gas and other commodities from Russia’. I agree. Under Putin’s presidency, Russia must be seen as a pariah state and ostracised from the world economy.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>We need to move quickly to stop the influence of corrupt Russian money in the UK. Despite warning after warning, the Government failed to act, leaving Britain as the destination of choice for kleptocrats who hide their wealth under our noses. It has been going on for far too long and should not have taken an invasion of Ukraine for the Government to act. The Economic Crime Bill must now be brought forward, as well as introducing an Overseas Entities Bill.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>But we must prepare for the consequences of these sanctions against Russia in energy and financial markets, working with our allies and partners to manage disruptions and shocks.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>International co-ordination with our allies is imperative. This applies not just to sanctions, but to humanitarian aid and military defensive actions. We must work in conjunction with our NATO allies to mount our response against Putin.</em></p>
<p><em>In the short term, we must:</em></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><em>ensure the Foreign Office is providing effective consular support and assistance, with sufficient staffing and resources, to help UK nationals and their families seeking to leave.  I have been pressing Ministers in the Foreign Office and Home Office for nearly a month now to make access to visas and travel documents for UK nationals and their families easier.  I am pleased there is an effort to streamline the process, but believe Ministers could, and should, have acted</em><em> far</em><em> more quickly.</em></li>
<li><em>provide urgent humanitarian assistance and to work with our partners and Ukraine’s neighbours to manage </em><em>the </em><em>large-scale displacement </em><em>that we are already seeing as </em><em>refugee</em><em>s</em><em> fl</em><em>ee their homeland</em><em>.</em></li>
<li><em>continue to play our part as a member of NATO to support and reinforce other NATO members on the Eastern flank.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>As difficult as it is to predict irrational behaviour, we must try and anticipate Putin’s next steps. In relation to this, given the overwhelming evidence that Russian state actors have tried to disrupt and destabilise western democracies by disseminating disinformation through social media platforms such as Facebook, including at election times, I asked the Prime Minister what steps his Government was taking to prevent this happening now. Unfortunately this doesn’t seem to be on the Government’s horizon yet. It should be.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t believe the Russian people want this war; this is an ageing and unstable leader with a warped view of what his legacy should be. The international community’s response must learn the lessons from history.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I’m grateful to everyone who has contacted me so far and for the humanity and kindness they have shown for the distress of the Ukrainian people. I’d particularly like to thank those of you who have offered to open up their homes to Ukrainian refugees. This is the Oldham and Saddleworth I’m so proud to serve.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br />
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong>Bradford South MP Judith Cummins has warned the government that if it does not act now, NHS dentistry in England faces collapse.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking in a debate on Access to NHS Dentistry which Judith co-sponsored, Judith told the government they were trying to solve long-term issues with short-term fixes:</p>



<p>“The current dental contract and under-investment makes work for dentists highly stressful and doesn’t allow them to provide the quality of care to their patients they feel they deserve. There are long-standing problems with burnout, recruiting and retention, with almost a thousand dentists leaving the NHS in England in the last financial year.”</p>



<p>According to the British Dental Association, over 40 million NHS dental appointments have been lost since the start of the pandemic, which amounts to a whole year’s worth of NHS dentistry in pre-COVID times.</p>



<p>Judith continued: “While the government has provided limited amounts of money for dentists to catch up on missed appointments, dental practices in my constituency tell me the funding is virtually unusable. It must be used by March and there is simply physically not enough time to fit these appointments in.”</p>



<p>However, this was an issue brewing long before the pandemic, as even before COVID, there was only enough dentistry for around half of the adult population in England to see an NHS dentist every two years.</p>



<p>Speaking after the debate, Judith said: “There is not a week that goes by where I don’t have someone contacting me about the lack of dentists. We’ve lost a whole year of appointments while the government is giving with one hand and taking away with the other because the government just knows the money just cannot be spent.</p>



<p>Yorkshire and the Humber has the worst child oral health in the country, with twice the level of tooth decay than in the East of England. In Bradford, almost a thousand children under the age of 10 had to be admitted to hospital to have decayed teeth removed under a general anaesthetic last year. That is thousands of children who are in pain while they await surgery.</p>



<p>We need a new deal that treats dentistry as an equal member of the NHS family and not as a Cinderella service. We must work to achieve a fully funded service where NHS dentistry is available to all. The government needs to act and it needs to act now.”</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>

<p>Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&#8217;s long overdue &#8220;Levelling Up&#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. </p>



<p>Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.</p>



<p>“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.</p>



<p>“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.</p>



<p>“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.</p>



<p>“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.</p>



<p>“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.</p>



<p>“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.</p>



<p>“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”</p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our combined efforts across the Senedd and Westminster are helping us revolutionise menopause care throughout the UK to help keep women wonderful.  There should be no politics in women’s health, and we must work together cross-party and with the devolved governments to make a difference to women’s lives and achieve our common goals.”</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>).

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients.

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
