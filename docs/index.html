<p>To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, how much additional carbon dioxide is generated by importing and burning LNG compared to using more natural gas delivered by pipeline from UK fields. (96748)</p>
<p>Tabled on: 04 January 2022</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
<strong>Greg Hands</strong>:</p>
<p>The Oil and Gas Association published analysis in May 2020, comparing the carbon intensity of United Kingdom Continental Shelf gas with imported liquified natural gas and pipelined gas:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/the-move-to-net-zero/net-zero-benchmarking-and-analysis/natural-gas-carbon-footprint-analysis/">https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/the-move-to-net-zero/net-zero-benchmarking-and-analysis/natural-gas-carbon-footprint-analysis/</a>.</p>
<p>This analysis shows that gas extracted from the United Kingdom Continental Shelf has an average emission intensity of 22 kgCO2e/boe; whereas imported liquified natural gas has a significantly higher average intensity of 59 kgCO2e/boe. The process of liquefaction, combined with the emissions produced by the transportation and regasification of the liquified natural gas once in the United Kingdom, is responsible for the higher emissions intensity.</p>
<p>The answer was submitted on 12 Jan 2022 at 16:57.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong><br />
To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, what his policy is on the required minimum level of oil stocks for national resilience. (96749)</p>
<p>Tabled on: 04 January 2022</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
<strong>Greg Hands</strong>:</p>
<p>Emergency oil stocks are a critical tool to defend against the harmful impacts of major disruptions to global oil supply. The UK holds emergency stocks of oil, primarily to release in a co-ordinated fashion with other members to the international market in the event of such major supply disruption. As a member of the International Energy Agency the UK is obligated to hold a minimum of 90 days of net imports. This obligation is passed on to companies that supply more than 50 thousand tonnes of key fuels to the UK market in a twelve-month period.</p>
<p>The answer was submitted on 12 Jan 2022 at 16:12.</p>
<p><strong> These two answers illustrate different features of the unsatisfactory energy policy pursued by the UK government. The government is still failing to licence the output of more gas from the UK North Sea, even though on their own figures for carbon dioxide output it would be hugely beneficial on this ground alone to substitute more UK natural gas for imported LNG. As officials and the Regulator seem to regard cutting CO 2 as the main requirement, often ignoring the need to maintain a secure supply and to keep prices down they should deduce from their own figures that they must substitute UK natural gas for imported LNG on green grounds alone. Price, security of supply, availability and the jobs, tax revenues  and incomes UK gas would generate also are potent arguments for more UK gas. Ministers have said they want this, so where are the new permits and where is the policy of encouragement to operators in the UK North Sea?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The government adopts the minimum standard for oil reserves and leaves that to the private sector, meaning the stocks are  not held in a UK strategic reserve here at home as some other countries do. The derisory level of gas stocks is a wanton disregard for national security. </strong></p>

<p>Hansard extract:</p>
<p class="hs_Para">I congratulate the Joint Committee on an excellent report, consisting of 191 pages of well-researched, balanced, temperate and intelligent analysis and recommendations. It is rare to find such qualities when it comes to subjects as important as online harms and, indeed, technology in the society of today. I will not go through the report’s recommendations in detail because I do not have the time, but also because I support and welcome just about all of them. I will mention, for example, the design for safety recommendation, which I think is excellent, but it is one among many excellent recommendations. Instead, I will focus my remarks on why this report needs to be implemented as quickly as possible and what else needs to happen.</p>
<p class="hs_Para">I want to start by speaking in praise of technology. I count myself as a tech evangelist. We have to think how many lives have been saved by remote medicine, how many marriages have been saved by not having to argue about the best way to get directions to an event, how much joy has been shared through cat memes or whatever, and how many businesses have been started on such platforms. Technology can and should be a force for good. That is why I went into engineering—to make the world work better for everyone—and my final year project at Imperial College was on a remote alarm to support people who need care in their own homes.</p>
<p class="hs_Para">Engineering should be a force for good, but as the report sets out, that is no longer how it is seen. Many of my constituents, for example, feel they are being tracked, monitored, surveilled and analysed, and they feel undermined because they do not want to have to go online to do what they want to do without feeling safe and secure. Self-regulation is broken, as the report says, and it did not need to be this way. Some of us may remember concerns, back when the web started out, that if it was used for commercial purposes, people would be flamed with emails and condemned for trying to advertise or do direct marketing on the web. Somehow, however, the web was captured by those on what I can only describe as the libertarian right, who sought to maintain the lie that technology and the internet were nothing to do with Government, while building monopolistic platforms with more money and more power than most Governments. Their attitude to regulation and Government, as I remember from my days at Ofcom, was often that if they ignored them, regulation and Government would go away.</p>

<p>The Clean Air Zone is due to go live across 10 Greater Manchester authorities in May. The zone is an instruction from the Tory Government after it lost a supreme Court Case brought by the climate change group Client Earth back in 2015.</p>
<p>The Government instruction means that Greater Manchester is legally obligated to implement the zone. However, the scheme is incredibly controversial, with politicians including Gwynne accusing the Government of not providing the requisite support to small businesses to comply with the new scheme.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons on Thursday, Gwynne raised the issue with the Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg. Gwynne argued that the £120 million pound allocated from the Governent to Greater Manchester for retrofitting was ‘wholly inadequate’, and as a result the proposed CAZ is ‘harmful’ to many small businesses.</p>
<p>Mogg responded by stating that Greater Manchester has a ‘socialist mayor who must live up to his responsibilities’ and follow the order from Government.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the exchange, Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“I was disappointed, but not necessarily surprised by Rees-Mogg’s response. It shows the disdain that he and the Government have towards Greater Manchester, and their reluctance to work with us constructively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effectively tackling these issues means Government providing proper support and partnership to get results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government cannot demand Greater Manchester implement these wide-ranging reforms without giving us the tools to do it fairly and in a way that doesn’t unfairly penalise residents and small business owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would encourage the Government to distance itself from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s pretty childish comments and get around the table with local Government and council leaders from Greater Manchester to sort this problem out.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy New Year to all constituents in Bristol South! It’s been a busy and controversial start to the year with new revelations about parties and gatherings in Downing Street and the answers and half-hearted ‘regrets’ from the Prime Minister have been anything but satisfactory. While doctors, nurses and care workers were working under immense pressure, dressed head to toe in constricting and uncomfortable PPE, while families were saying goodbye to loved ones over zoom unable to hold their hands or give them a kiss, the Prime Minister and his staff believed themselves above the laws they had set for the rest of the country. There are plenty of challenges ahead as we deal with the impact of Covid and a decade of underfunding for the NHS and social care.  We need a competent leader with integrity to manage that. It is time for this Prime Minister to resign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I joined a meeting of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on our inquiry into governance in this country and the transparency rules that ensure conflicts of interest are identified, and that there is regulation of access by current and former politicians and officials. We questioned Lord Evans, the Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, on the efficacy of the job that Lord Geidt, as Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests, has been able to do in his inquiry into the financing of the refurbishments made to Johnson’s Downing Street flat. Lord Evans has suggested, quite extraordinarily, that the correct information was not provided to Lord Geidt when he was undertaking inquiries.  Officials and advisers must not be able to pick and choose the information they hand over in investigations such as these. We must have clarity in this case and the Prime Minister must ensure his advisers and staff are complying fully with the demands of this and any other investigation that is undertaken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a busy week in my role as Shadow Social Care Minister. On Tuesday I attended a Labour Party roundtable with health experts along with Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. We discussed the immediate problems facing the NHS, particularly around staffing, and how they could be resolved, as well as the strategies that will ensure the NHS is fit for the care of the UK In the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. Lifestyles have changed dramatically since the NHS was first formed and there are a great many new aspects of health that previously were not considered under the purview of the NHS. Mental health in particular has a much greater impact on our physical health than perhaps was ever understood and it is important that our health services are able to care for and support the needs of patients both physically and mentally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was also pleased to meet with Stephen Beet, the Director of Adult Social Services for Bristol City Council, Councillor Helen Holland and Oonagh Smyth, CEO of Skills for Care. Social care is not something that should be considered as an afterthought or separate from the main work of the NHS. Without adequate provision for social care in the community, the NHS are required to take on an extra task that both takes resources away from urgent medical care and takes adults with particular needs out of the comfort and security of their own homes. We need to ensure that we respect the value of social care and provide the resources that are needed to build social care within communities. Part of that is ensuring we have a workforce that is large enough to cope with the demand and that is respected among society. For too long our vital carers have been considered low-skilled and have received low pay. I would argue that it is an incredibly skilled job as not only do they need a variety of medical care skills, they need the people skills and the mental resilience that are required for such a care-oriented role. I would encourage anyone who thinks they are kind, caring, compassionate, with a love of working with people to consider whether they might enjoy social care and take a look at the </span><a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Careers-in-care/Think-Care-Careers.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills for Care website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that many constituents, both as patients and medical staff, are concerned about access to GP services in the area. I was pleased to meet with GP’s in an online meeting to discuss the current issues facing surgeries in the area. GP surgeries are an essential service, but they are not the only medical service available. Too few people I think realise the help and support that can be found in your local pharmacy who are often the best first port of call with issues as they can provide advice on many ailments. As well as GPs, advice can be sought from the 111 helpline, especially during out of hours when you are not in need of an emergency ambulance. We have some truly fantastic doctors and nurses in Bristol South who are committed to ensuring that the community has the best care possible. They were keen to stress that GP surgeries remain open and that patients must not be afraid to come forward and discuss with them any concerning symptoms or changes in their bodies. We know how important early detection is in the treatment of various illnesses, especially cancer, so I would remind constituents to contact their GP surgeries sooner rather than later if they are concerned about anything. </span></p>

<p>This week Liz voted, via her proxy, to call on the Government to support businesses that are facing huge challenges this year. The Government abstained on the vote.</p>
<p>Soaring energy bills, a difficult Christmas trading period and crippling inflation have put British business under pressure. Labour’s fully costed plan will help consumers and businesses weather this crisis, and get the economy firing on all cylinders. Labour would:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a £600 million contingency fund to support struggling firms</li>
<li>freeze business rates this year, saving the average small shop or factory £4,000</li>
<li>scrap and replace business rates with a fairer system fit for the 21st century, ensuring online giants and bricks and mortar shops are on a level playing field</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government has refused to support these measures, but it is British firms that will pay the price.</p>

<p><strong>Friday 21 January, 2022 6-8pm</strong></p>

<p><strong>Interested parties can participate in-person or virtually</strong></p>

<p>When news broke that Vattenfall may be looking at their community benefit fund ‘in the round’ of Norfolk, many were rightly angry and concerned that those communities that could bear the brunt of any construction would miss out on the community benefits they deserved. From day one, I have always been clear that IF Necton and other affected villages accommodate this Nationally Significant Infrastructure, Vattenfall must provide substantial compensation to the village and surrounding villages in the form of community benefits.</p>

<p>That’s why I responded to these local fears and teamed up with Jerome Mayhew MP and Duncan Baker MP to write to Vattenfall and make exactly that case.</p>

<p>Unlike before, the Vattenfall team were much more amiable about the conversation and we welcomed their agreement that community benefits in the communities that would likely be most affected should be investigated more thoroughly. At the suggestion of Necton Parish Council and I, Vattenfall agreed to host a series of workshops as part of a much larger package of engagement with Necton and the surrounding villages in Mid Norfolk. They also confirmed they’d do the same in other parts of Norfolk and are working with parliamentary colleagues to deliver that.</p>

<p>This workshop is the first such event and I will be opening proceedings with the Necton Parish Chair to frame the conversation and spark this vitally important discussion. This very much will be the first step in a long process.</p>

<p>If YOU are local resident, please do take the time to either come along or dial in virtually. Full details can be found on the poster below.</p>

<p>Any community benefits will of course be contingent on Vattenfall’s plans being granted, and then maintaining, permission – and, as we know, there are no guarantees after the successful judicial review against Norfolk Vanguard previously. I very much understand why so many are opposed to the proposals and continue to share their belief that Vattenfall are looking to construct their substations in the incorrect place.</p>

<p>IF the windfarms do go ahead however, it is vital that the communities affected keep up the pressure and to try and make sure they get as much community benefit as possible in return. I am firmly committed to supporting that effort.</p>

<p><strong>This article was written by Carrington Walker and published on <em><a href="https://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/john-penrose-downing-street-party-justice-8619202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Weston Mercury</a></em>.</strong></p>



<p>Boris Johnson&#8217;s anti-corruption champion has said &#8216;justice will have to be done promptly&#8217; once an inquiry releases its findings on whether Downing Street partied during lockdown.</p>



<p>Yesterday (January 12), the Prime Minister apologised to the House of Commons for attending what he believed to be&nbsp;a work event in his garden after it was revealed an email invited around 100 people asking them to bring their own booze.</p>



<p>Weston MP John Penrose, who was appointed by Boris Johnson to be anti-corruption champion in 2019, was<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/how-did-mps-vote-covid-vaccine-8565642" target="_blank"> one of the 99 Tory MPs to rebel against his vaccine passport mandate last month.</a></p>



<p>Mr Penrose told the Mercury that the Prime Minister was right to apologise, though many questions remain to be answered.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Like most people, I have been extremely concerned about reports of parties or other gatherings in Downing Street that might have broken the covid rules, at a time when the entire country was trying to minimise the risks of infecting our families, friends or work colleagues.</p>



<p>&#8220;So the Prime Minister was right to apologise for attending a staff event in the Downing Street garden, but I am afraid there are still a good many&nbsp;questions which remain to be answered.</p>



<p>&#8220;We need to let the independent inquiry complete its work rather than prejudging what it will find but, once&nbsp;we have a clear picture of the remaining facts, justice will have to be done promptly.”</p>



<p>An independent inquiry is underway and being headed by senior civil servant, Sue Gray.</p>



<p>Prime Minster&#8217;s Questions on January 12 was the first public appearance made by Boris Johnson since the latest piece of evidence to suggest Covid rules may have been broken by Downing Street ministers and staff by holding a string of parties while the UK was in lockdown.</p>



<p>More than 10 parties are reported to have taken place in Downing Street during these lockdowns.</p>

<p>I spoke in a Westminster Hall debate on the need for the UK Government to urgently do more to enable global access to vaccines for COVID-19. A global response is essential. </p>

<p><strong>Full text of my speech:</strong></p>



<p>I want to declare an interest I&#8217;m chair of the all party group on vaccinations for all. And vice-chair of the Coronavirus all party group, where we&#8217;ve been taking evidence every fortnight since July, 2020, including hearing from health ministers across Sub-Saharan Africa and other places that emphasize what we&#8217;ve been hearing today, the difficulties they have in access, and also the poor quality of supply that they&#8217;re actually getting. It is certainly true that all of us have gained from the researchers who&#8217;ve developed new vaccines and I too pay tribute to the staff of the four NHS across the UK, for the speed and skill with which they have delivered it.</p>



<p>But we have vaccinated almost 80% of adults with a third or booster shot, when the access to even one shot in low-income countries is well below 10%. And that simply highlights what we mean by, in adequate access and inequity across the globe.</p>



<p>High-income countries have literally hoovered up the vaccines as they were developed over the last year. And that&#8217;s indefensible. It&#8217;s very reminiscent of aids. When people in Africa who were suffering from HIV or aids couldn&#8217;t access the treatments that were available in the richer countries.</p>



<p>The spring before 2020, I keep forgetting it&#8217;s a new year. We heard lots of warm words about a global response, to a global crisis. But that is simply not what we&#8217;ve seen. We have seen that COVAX was established and the UK government gave over 500 million pounds to it. It didn&#8217;t give any vaccines until quite late last year.</p>



<p>And what was meant to happen with COVAX is that they would procure directly from companies &#8211; that never happened. And therefore COVAX has ended up completely dependent on getting donated doses from countries that were wealthy and simply did advanced procurements. And that&#8217;s the reason COVAX has delivered less than half of the 2 billion doses it was aspiring to deliver last year.</p>



<p>The UK government promised a hundred million doses in June 2021 at the G7 -80 million to COVAX, 20 million bilaterally. There&#8217;s been less than a quarter of that, that has actually been delivered to COVAX. We are at the end of 2021, the hundred million is meant to be delivered by this coming June, which means 9.1 million a month to COVAX, a total of 11 and a half million if you include any bilateral donations. So the UK needs to radically step up donations of doses. And donations of doses are the acute response. Because that can be done in the short term. The UK has enough excess that it could carry out its third and indeed for many vulnerable patients, fourth doses, as I&#8217;ve had myself as an immunocompromised person.</p>



<p>And still accelerate the donation of doses to more than meet its target by June.</p>



<p>Marker</p>



<p>The problem is wealthy countries think they can protect their populations purely by vaccinating their own population. And Omicron shows that simply isn&#8217;t true. When you have large parts of the world, particularly in the global south with low access to vaccines, you will generate high spread. You will generate therefore more mutations, and eventually there will be new variants. And some of those variants may be as infectious as Omicron, may be as transmissible, may be as good at at escaping either natural immunity or previous vaccination. They may turn out to be much more severe. This fairy story that inevitably a virus is committed to becoming milder is something that we are not in a position to count on.</p>



<p>So we still right now, two years into this crisis need a global response. And I therefore would call on the government the need to accelerate the donations, using the excess that we have. But these do need to be predictable. They need to be in collaboration with the low-income countries that are receiving them and they need to have a decent shelf life.</p>



<p>We heard of ministers having to visit the ports every day in case something had arrived. Having to keep stopping their own programs because suddenly they get a delivery that&#8217;s got a few weeks left on it. So that is disrespectful to countries that do not have the health infrastructure that we have across the UK.</p>



<p>It is critical to include consumables like syringes, needles. It&#8217;s also important to try and support the wider COVID-19 responses. If you look at the WHO data, you will notice the incredibly low levels of COVID supposedly in Africa. Africa does not have low levels. They have low levels of access to tests, and therefore the cases are not being registered. And we shouldn&#8217;t be using these doses as part of the already reduced ODA budget and certainly not charging them as more than the UK government has paid for them.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the short term approach, but the medium term approach is to massively increase global production. And the problem is the TRIPSwaiver has been being discussed basically for over a year.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d be in a totally different position if that had been moved on at the beginning.</p>



<p>The UK is one of a dwindling number of countries, which is blocking it -over 130 countries now support it. And it is important to recognize that most of the leading COVID-19 vaccines have indeed been developed with public funding, either from university settings, which are largely publicly funded or through the huge injections by the UK government, the US government, the EU governments and others.</p>



<p>It is important when we touched on polio, to think about the fact that Salt didn&#8217;t patent his vaccine, Alexander Fleming didn&#8217;t patent penicillin, Röntgen didn&#8217;t patent x-rays because they saw them as part of the global good.</p>



<p>As well as getting rid of the blockage of intellectual property rights and patents,</p>



<p>it&#8217;s important that there is proper sharing of data and technology transfer. But MSF have identified a hundred companies across Africa, Asia and Latin America, which are certified by the EMA, by the FDA or the WHO on good manufacturing practice. So to imply that it isn&#8217;t possible to produce vaccines to high quality in the global south is frankly insulting.</p>



<p>And messenger RNA vaccines hold a whole hope in the future for many neglected, tropical diseases, such as TB, such as malaria and others because of the technology. So by sharing that technology, now, it isn&#8217;t just about dealing with COVID-19. It actually opens up the ability to tackle the scourges of infectious diseases that many countries face.</p>



<p>The other thing is that the UK should be increasing production, to become a net exporter instead of importer. And therefore it is absolutely inexplicable why the UK government pooled funding from the Valneva production site in Livingston, when the trial data was about to be published. That was successful.</p>



<p>And as has been mentioned, because it&#8217;s a very traditional whole virus approach. There may be people who have been unwilling to take the messenger RNA vaccines, who would be willing to receive the Valneva vaccine. Because it&#8217;s whole virus, it may, and this has not yet been trialed, also provide a broader reaction</p>



<p>that may therefore remain viable, even when other variants arrive. What we&#8217;ve seen is that Omicron in comparison to Delta, which had four mutations on the spike protein Omicron has 32, it&#8217;s a totally different shape. And therefore, sadly, the AstraZeneca vaccine simply the key no longer fits the lock.</p>



<p>Pfizer does. But it wanes. We need to have broader vaccines so that we might be a bit more resistant to, to variance in the future.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important for the government to maintain the support for routine vaccination. And that means honoring the replenishment commitments to Gavi because routine vaccinations have suffered due to the disruption of the pandemic.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s important that UK has always been a leading funder of vaccination and they mustn&#8217;t now pool back. But also to think about future pandemics, the replenishment of Sepi, the epidemic preparedness initiative is coming up this year. The UK needs to commit to that. We are all talking about humanitarian and the moral need to support people in poor countries to have the access we&#8217;ve had..</p>



<p>But on top of the lives lost and the huge multi-trillion economic hit to the world, it is important that we recognize that this was a global challenge. The international community so far has failed. It doesn&#8217;t hold great hope for that other challenge of climate crisis if we can&#8217;t get our act together now in facing this.</p>

<p>Goodness knows what we can expect from Prime Minister&#8217;s Questions this week but last week, in the first of the year, the PM displayed a disturbing pattern by showing contempt for proceedings and a reckless disregard for accuracy when answering questions.</p>



<p>First he denied ever saying inflation fears were unfounded. Almost immediately a recording emerged of him saying exactly that. He then claimed several times that the Warm Homes Discount is worth £140 per week. It&#8217;s worth £140 per year.</p>



<p>Finally, he claimed that it&#8217;s Labour policy to rejoin the EU. It isn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Questions to the Prime Minister is a British tradition dating back to the 1880s and the premiership of Gladstone. It&#8217;s a bedrock of our system which highlights that our PM is first among equals and open to regular scrutiny from his peers.</p>



<p>In theory he doesn&#8217;t know the questions in advance but in reality government Whips have a good idea of what is coming from their side and make reasonable guesses about the opposition, hence that bulky folder he carries.</p>



<p>Previous PMs have often used the occasion to show mastery over the Commons although quite a few, including Harold Wilson who often needed a stiff brandy beforehand, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, have all admitted to finding it terrifying.</p>



<p>Parliamentary etiquette doesn&#8217;t permit MPs to call each other liars although the ministerial code states it is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful answers and seek to correct the record in event of an error. Right now there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a remedy if ministers fail to comply.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s an increasing clamour to restore some gravitas. It&#8217;s simply not good enough for the PM to say the first thing that comes into his head. One interesting idea is to invite him to take the oath at the start, as happens before giving evidence in court.</p>



<p>This would impress on all concerned the need for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</p>



<p>We need some kind of intervention, if we&#8217;re to prevent one of our most venerable traditions from falling into total disrepute.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>In Parliament last night, local MP Tim Farron urged Health Ministers to bring a long-awaited radiotherapy unit to Kendal's Westmorland General Hospital.</p>
<p>In the South Lakes, cancer patients have to make a 2-3 hour round trip for five days a week, for weeks on end to reach their nearest treatment radiotherapy centre in Preston.</p>
<p>During a speech in Westminster Hall, Tim cited the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group who say it is bad practice for patients to have to travel for more than 45 minutes for treatment.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"Networked satellite radiotherapy units have been a huge success elsewhere in the country and, once they open, have been shown to increase the number of people able to take up that life-saving treatment. Satellites save more lives.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"We have the space at the hospital, designs have been done, the bid has been written and rewritten, and the inaction of managers in NHS England and Ministers in the Department of Health is inexcusable. It is a reminder of why rural communities feel so taken for granted and ignored by the Government and by NHS bosses nationally and regionally. Talk of levelling up the north is meaningless when Ministers appear not to realise that there is 100 miles of England north of Preston until the next nearest cancer centre.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Today, I ask the Minister to instruct NHS England to work with our local trusts in Cumbria and Lancashire finally to deliver our long-awaited satellite radiotherapy unit at Kendal. Our community will listen carefully to her response."</em>
</p>
<p>Responding, the Health Minister Maria Caufield said: <em>"The honourable member for Westmorland and Lonsdale raised the issue of satellite units.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"I would just be slightly careful. Cancer alliances are mapping out cancer services in their areas, and I am very happy to meet colleagues who would like better provision in their local area, but they also need to meet their cancer alliances, which are looking at service provision locally.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"It has to be a local decision, because local oncologists have to feel that they are able to support the multidisciplinary team who support the radiotherapy process, ranging from diagnostics through to the treatment itself. That has to be in place, so it does absolutely need to be done on a local basis, but I am happy to meet colleagues if they feel that the case is not being heard locally."</em>

<p>Mr MacNeil was in the House of Commons for Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday (Wednesday) where he joined with hundreds of cross-party MPs calling for Boris Johnson to resign.</p>



<p>He said: “I have been contacted by constituents who are, quite rightly, angry at the actions of the Prime Minister.</p>



<p>“At a time when there were challenges for everyone as we adapted our lives to abide by the strict rules with the aim of protecting the NHS and saving lives, it is beyond belief that this gathering was organised and went ahead.</p>



<p>“There is no way back for Boris Johnson who has lost all public confidence and the only decent option for him is to resign.</p>



<p>“The disregard to his own rules by the Prime Minister is also a reflection on the Tory party as a whole as its MPs were dragooned into the Chamber yesterday by the whips but sat in stony silence during PMQs.</p>



<p>“The Investigation into the circumstances of the gathering at No.10 is to be carried out by Sue Gray, a Civil Servant appointed by the UK Government to investigate the UK Government.&nbsp; Essentially this is to find out if Boris Johnson knew that Boris Johnson was at a party in Boris Johnson&#8217;s garden.&nbsp; The Prime Minister is trying to make mugs of the public, but the public sees through him.</p>



<p>“Clearly now is the time for Scotland to make its own path and plans must get underway for an independence referendum.”</p>



<p>SNP Leader Ian Blackford, spoke in the Chamber yesterday stressing that the public no longer had confidence in the Prime Minister and that the ‘right thing to do’ would be to resign.</p>



<p>The Scottish Conservative Leader Douglas Ross also called for Boris Johnson to resign but was ignored and his role in the party was played down by senior Conservative figures.</p>

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Yesterday in Parliament, Judith challenged the government on their response to young girls and women being spiked. There has been a rise in the reporting of needle spiking in the media and on social networks in recent months. Across September and October of last year, the National Police Chief’s Council reported 198 confirmed reports of drink spiking, and 56 reports of spiking through injections.</p>



<p>Speaking in the commons, <strong>Judith Cummins MP</strong> asked: “Many girls and women are afraid of enjoying a night out or going to a music festival for fear of being spiked, raped, and assaulted. What work is the minister doing with venues such as bars, nightclubs and music festivals to prevent this from happening and to ensure appropriate safeguarding measures are in place, and what is the assessment of the scale of problem at these venues?”</p>



<p>In response, <strong>Rachel Maclean, Minister for Safeguard</strong>ing responded: “The night time economy are playing a key role, and they are taking their responsibilities seriously. We work very closely with them as the government and we’re we are providing funding and helping them provide training to staff so women can feel safe at night.”</p>



<p>Commenting after, <strong>Judith said:</strong> “No-one should be at risk whilst enjoying time with friends, and the fact is that spiking and sexual assault disproportionally affect girls and women. While I welcome the work to tackle drinks spiking, I remain worried that proper safeguarding measures are not in place. The Government urgently need to improve the understanding of the scale and impact of spiking of this worrying crime, and work with police, venues and event organisers to prevent this type of crime so that women and girls are safe.”</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>).

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>

<p>Llanelli
MP, Nia Griffith today criticised the Conservatives for a decade of dither,
delay and poor planning on Britain’s energy sector – as well as calling for a
windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas to stop energy bills rising over the next
year.</p>



<p>She
pointed to the Tory UK Government’s failure to meet the vast potential of
British renewable and nuclear energy and its failure to properly regulate our
energy market, leading to dozens of energy companies going bust.&nbsp; The result is rapidly rising prices and an
energy crisis hitting millions, including many families across Llanelli.</p>



<p>To
address the immediate crisis, Labour are calling for fully-funded measures now
to reduce the expected price rise in April &#8211; saving most households around £200
or more – and targeted extra support to the squeezed middle, pensioners and the
lowest earners, receiving up to £600 off bills and preventing all of the
increase in energy bills currently expected.</p>



<p>This
would be paid for with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas
producers who have profited from the price rises.</p>



<p>Highlighting
how crucial it is to keep energy bills lower in future, Labour have said they
would: </p>



<ul><li>Reduce Britain’s reliance on imported gas by accelerating home-grown
renewables and new nuclear </li><li>Make sure millions more homes are warm and well-insulated, saving
households an average of £400 a year on bills&nbsp;
</li><li>Regulate the market better, with a pledge to never again let energy
companies play fast and loose with the rules.</li></ul>



<p>NIA
GRIFFITH said:</p>



<p>“Ten
years of the Conservative’s failed energy policy, dither and delay has created
a price crisis that’s being felt by people right here in Llanelli.</p>



<p>“That’s
why Labour would give local families security by taking fully-funded measures
to save most households around £200 or more, targeting extra support on top of

<p>“But we need more than a short-term fix.  Labour’s plan to keep energy bills lower in future would mean really speeding up investment in renewable energy, both to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and to tackle climate change, retro fit millions of more homes to save households an average of £400 a year on their bills, and reform our broken energy system.  It is only right, after all, that the energy producers benefitting from this crisis are asked to pay their fair sh</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>At Full Council on Monday 10<sup>th</sup> January Nottingham City Labour Councillors are expressing their disappointment with the Government’s response to the social care crisis and pressing them for a fair funding system for social care that does not involve further council tax rises. <br> <br>Proposing the motion, Cllr Graham Chapman is expected to say “The amount of additional funding, both in the short and long term, will not ‘fix the problem’. The Government continues to rely on regressive council tax increases to plug gaps and there is no long-term strategy for training, recruitment, sustainable wage growth, or professionalising  the sector service which struggling to recruit. This results in further pressure on the NHS as social care is less able to prevent admission and the support that people need in order for them to leave hospital safely and promptly &#8211; or prevent admission &#8211;  is in short supply. </p>



<p>“The Government needs to provide a better solution than the piecemeal policy it has just announced. It needs to be properly funded, comprehensive. &#8211; if necessary via a levy on wealth of those who can afford it to ensure that there is no further call on council tax payers, many of whom are already struggling. Not doing so is just adding more pressure and costs on the NHS  as well as offering an inadequate service to some of the most vulnerable in our community. “<br> <br> In 2015 the Conservative Government introduced the adult social care precept which put up to an additional 3% on council tax bills to pay for social care services for adults. In the last two years alone that has meant an extra £89 on council tax bills in Nottingham. This comes at the same time as funding from central government to meet the needs of Nottingham people has been cut by £100 million over 10 years, <br> <br>Commenting on the local context, Portfolio Holder for Adults and Health, Cllr Adele Williams said “It isn’t only that government funding for adult social care  just isn’t enough- it’s also the way it is done &#8211; in piecemeal short term announcement designed to sound like significant funding but actually falling well short of the sustainable long term plan that Labour has called for &#8211; along with the Association of Directors  of Adult Social Care and it seems virtually everyone but the government. It’s also important that we don’t just focus on protecting the assets of wealthy homeowners. Few people in Nottingham will benefit and many will lose out  from the changes to the new asset rules that are to be funded by  the new levy on National insurance &#8211;  but nearly all of us will pay for it. It will also do nothing to support the availability of care, the pay that carers get or the quality of the service.  “Instead of a real plan to build the social care system we need for the 21st century, we have another inadequate sticking plaster that the wrong people are paying too much for. I hope this motion on Monday will help put pressure on the Government for a fair and sustainable solution to adult social care funding.”<br><br> The agenda for the Full Council meeting can be found here &#8211; <a href="https://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=155&amp;MId=9182">https://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=155&amp;MId=9182</a><br><br></p>

<p>Often in the worst of times, we see the best of people. That&#8217;s especially true in our communities, where, every day, we see people doing incredible work. In fact, they are so busy helping others it is sometimes too easy to forget just how special they are.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to celebrate some of these heroes in Parliament &#8211; and where it has been safe to do so, meet with them, and thank them, in person.  But there are many more, the unsung majority &#8211; you will know a few of them yourselves. You may even be one of them but don&#8217;t even think about it.</p>
<p>To them all, I say thank you.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, no better example of the best of our communities than the MFR Cash for Kids Christmas Appeal.</p>
<p>People across the Highlands came together to ensure every local child had a gift to open on Christmas day.</p>
<p>The incredible Cash for Kids team worked flat out to deliver all the gifts across the Highlands &#8211; and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>They were supported by local fundraisers, businesses, volunteers, and all of you, who took the time to buy a gift that is sure to have put a smile on a child’s face on Christmas day, not to mention offer some slight relief to struggling parents.</p>
<p>It is heart-warming to imagine the weight lifted off families and the smile on the face of their child – even if it was just for one day.</p>
<p>Especially when more families than ever before are facing a tough time.</p>
<p>Along with amazing local charities, foodbanks and community volunteers, my team and I are doing all we can to help as well as continuing to urge the UK Government to change course.</p>
<p>But the reality is, the UK Government know the impact of the choices they are making, these are deliberate actions.</p>
<p>With its limited powers over Social Security the Scottish Government is showing different choices can be made by putting dignity and respect at the heart of policy.</p>
<p>What better place to start building a Social Security system ensuring every child has a fair start in life?</p>
<p>As we look ahead to 2022, I hope this is a statement of intent on which we can all agree.</p>
<p>To you and your family, from me, my family, and my team, I wish you a Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Last year- December 15 2020, an electrical fire damaged Ashley Court in Hatfield. Residents, a number of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site in temporary accommodation since the incident.</p>
<p>Sanctuary have handed over control of the site to a construction team to restore the block, but earlier this year residents were shocked to find that they were being charged £225 per month in service charges to the Housing Association.</p>
<p>Residents, who are still not able to come back to Ashley Court, are being charged for a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, alarm rental and monitoring, ground maintenance, water rates, electricity , internal maintenance, waste disposal, lift, laundry equipment, building insurance, internal maintenance and window cleaning. All of which they are not able to get any benefit from.</p>
<p>After the fire, security guards were in place to guard the property. However, they were removed after a short amount of time and a number of flats were broken into this September, with personal items stolen.</p>
<p>Cllr Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, contacted Sanctuary about this issue in October, asking them to look again at this situation and stop demanding payment from the displaced residents.</p>
<p>Sanctuary responded to Cllr Hebden’s letter, but did not agree to waive the £225 p/m charge on the residents.</p>
<p>Now, Mr Shapps has written a letter (below) Sanctuary Housing’s CEO Craig Moule about this issue to reiterate the need for this charge to be waived, and for residents to be refunded.</p></div>

This is now the 2nd Christmas that residents will be away from their homes and that is totally unacceptable. Sanctuary Housing need to seriously review their approach as to how they manage major incidents such as this and keep the residents at the forefront of their plans. They have shown little understanding and compassion for the terrible time the residents have gone through.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “The residents of Ashley Court have been away from their homes for a year now- living with friends, family and in other temporary accommodation through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>“It does not seem fair that they are having to shell out cash for lifts and equipment that isn’t being used, for waste disposal when they aren’t living there, and for a caretaker and window cleaning on a building that is essentially a building site.</p>
<p>“So I’m hoping that the CEO of Sanctuary Housing will agree with myself and Cllr Hebden, and put the minds of the Ashley Court residents at ease by waiving these charges.”<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p></div>

<p>My week in Westminster began when I joined the Wales All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Hospitality, Events, and Major Food and Drink Businesses, chaired by Jess Morden MP, to receive an update from many guest speakers involved in this very important sector in Wales.</p>
<p>David Chapman, Executive Director for Wales UK Hospitality introduced the discussion by highlighting the recruitment crisis in the sector. Staffing is 30% down on 2020 levels because of, amongst other things, less migrant workers, end of the furlough scheme and business rates relief (England), the increase in VAT from 5 to 12.5% on 1st October 2021, which will go up to 20% on 1st April 2022, competition from other sectors that have more regular working hours, and staff isolating because of Covid regulations. Staff that have loyally remained in the sector are suffering from mental health issues and anxiety due to overwork because they are covering other members of staff duties.</p>
<p>The Group Task and Development Director at Celtic Manor Group, which consists of seven hotels and venues, spoke about the high level of vacancies she has in both permanent and casual posts. Many who left in March 2020 have not returned, and that it’s now a candidates market because of staff shortages, so candidates dictate and negotiate the terms of their employment. And even though all roles have received increased wages, many are still leaving for jobs with slightly higher rates of pay.</p>
<p>The Welsh Rarebit Collective represents 200 independent hotels and its representative said that the lack of staff has never been so bad in the Wales hospitality sector. Many of his members have to turn away business because of lack of staff. He had conducted a straw poll amongst his members and only 11% are running at full capacity, whilst 80% are turning away business.</p>
<p>The speakers also agreed that there was a perception in the UK that a job in the hospitality sector was something that is fitted in between school and university, or a temporary job until securing a “proper” career, rather than being viewed as a genuine career itself. And that one of the major challenges is to change this culture, which should begin in schools and colleges.</p>
<p>I dropped in to the Women’s Aid photo session which was held to promote their #DeserveToBeHeard campaign supporting women who have suffered domestic abuse and the barriers they have faced when seeking help. I pledged to #HearHer. Please read more – Mental Health and Domestic Abuse – by Women’s Aid. Reframing the Links: Black and minorities women, domestic violence, and abuse, and mental health- A Review of the Literature – by Ravi Thiara and Christine Harrison University of Warwick.</p>
<p>The APPG for Rare, Genetic, and Undiagnosed Conditions joined with the APPG for Life Sciences Diseases, jointly chaired by Liz Twist MP and Daniel Zeichner MP, to discuss the UK Rare Diseases Framework. This is an important piece of policy development which will change the landscape for people affected by rare conditions. Whilst the population of an individual rare disease is small, there are over seven thousand identified rare conditions, consequently one in seventeen will be affected by a rare condition at sometime in their lives which equates to 3.5 million in the UK and three quarters of all rare diseases affect children. It is estimated that these rare diseases are responsible for about a third of infant mortality in the UK and it takes about four years to be diagnosed with a rare condition. But licensed medical products are only available for a small minority of rare diseases, making it very difficult for patients to access potentially life saving treatment. The Framework was released in January 2021. The guest speakers discussed the development of the UK Government Action Plans that will implement the Framework, and will be announced at the beginning of next year. These Action Plans are vital in leading systemic change so that people with rare diseases are given the care they need.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the Second Delegated Legislation Committee which discussed the Draft Solvency 2 (Group Supervision) (Amendment) Regulations 2021. The draft instrument was made to address deficiencies in retained EU Law. It will ensure that an equivalence decision which assesses that the insurance group supervision regime in another country is equivalent to that in the UK and avoids duplication of supervisory work in relation to insurance groups. HM Treasury explain that the purpose is to ensure that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) where it is group supervisor of a UK insurance group with a parent in a third country, including the EU, can defer to the supervisory authority in that third country in certain circumstances, if the insurance group supervision regime in the third country has been assessed as equivalent to the UK‘s regime. HMT says that these changes will avoid unnecessary duplication, reduce regulatory compliance cost for UK insurance groups, reduce supervisory cost for the PRA, and reduce the need for co-ordination between third country supervisor authorities and the PRA. The members of the committee debated the draft instrument which was passed unanimously without a division.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup> December I attended the APPG Wales and the World, chaired by Craig Williams MP for Montgomeryshire, and attended by Simon Baynes MP, Liz Saville-Roberts MP, Robin Millar MP, and Ben Lake MP. The meeting was addressed by Megan Williams, who runs the Welsh North American Association. Megan explained how the Association was set up and since 1929 has organised an annual Gymanfa Ganu. It currently has 2500 members, publishes the Ninnau Newspaper and has links with Welsh Associations across America and the World, including the Welsh Society of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As a member of the Petitions Committee I was selected to lead a Westminster Hall Petition Debate on 13th December, on behalf petitioner Richard Ackers who set up Justice for Reggie, following the death of his puppy Reggie from Parvovirus within a few days of buying Reggie from an online seller. Richard’s petition, which closed with over 109,000 signatures, calls for regulating all websites where animals are sold, including verification of sellers’ identity and pictures of animals for sale with their parents. Ahead of the debate I held a virtual round table to gather evidence from animal welfare organisations about online advertising of the sale of animals. I met with the Dogs Trust, RSPCA, Cats Protection, British Veterinary Association, Kennel Club, and the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) so that I could include their perspective on the aim of the petition.</p>
<p>I held a separate virtual meeting with the petitioner Richard Ackers and learned how he and his family were heartbroken following the death of his puppy Reggie, and he was outraged to find out that there were no regulations covering UK online animal sale advertising, after buying Reggie, who was advertised on an online website from an allegedly reputable seller. Richard set up his petition to prevent others being duped by disreputable sellers. Read the debate <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/159543/regulation-of-online-animal-sales-to-be-debated-by-mps/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I joined the Western Gateway APPG co-chaired by Jess Morden MP and Mark Harper MP for an update on the Western Gateway partnership whose aims are – connecting communities, championing businesses, creating opportunities for sustainable growth, and bringing together businesses, academia, and governments across the River Severn to work together to attract new opportunities for the 4.4 million people living in this region. Its “Step Fusion” bid could provide a near limitless source of low carbon energy that produces four million times more energy than every kilogram of fuel than burning coal, oil, or gas. Fusion doesn’t emit harmful toxins like carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and nuclear fusion reactors provide no high activity, long-lived nuclear waste. It will be situated at Severn Edge because this site once led the world in the development of nuclear power production, is in the levelling-up areas of England and Wales, and close to many Welsh communities identified by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) left-behind index. It can tap into the local massive supply chain, the UK’s National fusion laboratory at Culham, Bristol University high temperature engineering expertise, and nearby R &amp; D facilities. I look forward to the Western Gateway Powerhouse Conference next year.</p>
<p>I attended the APPG for Down Syndrome online meeting following the Second Reading of the Down Syndrome (England) Private Members’ Bill tabled by Liam Fox MP. The APPG was co-chaired by Lisa Cameron MP and Matt Western MP. Liam Fox said that his Bill was in the “Write Around” stage where all UK Government Departments can pledge their support and can add conditions before the Bill goes into committee, where it will be debated and can be amended. Mr Fox hopes that his Bill will pass through the Lords in one day. We heard very powerful, positive, statements from husband and wife, James and Heidi Carter, who support the Bill, and have Down Syndrome. This absolutely charming, happy, couple told us that it “Doesn’t Define Me”. James said that he works hard to support his wife and has a few jobs. Heidi said that James was very handsome, and they love each other very much.</p>
<p>The Co-operative Parliamentary Group met in person on Wednesday afternoon to listen to Rose Marley, CEO of Co-operatives UK, but unfortunately, as soon as the meeting began the division bell, rang summoning MPs to the voting lobby. Consequently, the Co-operative Party Officers Joe Fortune, General Secretary, Emma Hoddinott, Assistant General Secretary, and Rob Bates, Political and Parliamentary Officer, decided that instead of holding a formal meeting, it was turned into a sort of informal drop-in event where MPs called in to speak with Rose and the officers, between the series of votes which lasted most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Chairman of Ways and Means, Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing MP,  who is in charge of the Panel of Parliamentary Chairs convened our Autumn Meeting. We paid tribute to our colleague Sir David Amess MP who was tragically murdered, and held a minute silence. We discussed the forward plan for 2022 covering the responsibilities covered by all the chairs: Public Bill Committees, General Committees, Westminster Hall Debates, and Delegated Legislation Committees. Plus the rules of behaviour and courtesies in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Lord Colin Moynihan co-chair (with the late Sir David Amess) of the APPG for Olympics and Paralympics convened a special AGM of the APPG to pay tribute to Sir David, who, as I have already mentioned, was tragically murdered last month, and to elect a new co-chair to succeed David. I was so proud and honoured to be unanimously elected as co-chair, and pledged to do my very best to continue to work with the members of the APPG in memory of David, who was a dear friend to me, and who helped me so much when I was a newly elected MP. David and I became close friends and we shared a passion for all types of sport. He had a wonderful mischievous nature, a dry sense of humour, and was always happy. David loved to tease me and I miss him more each day.</p>
<p>On Friday, I was back in my constituency at the (socially distanced) switching on of the Melin Christmas Lights at Melin Community Trust, by Neath Town Councillor Keith Finn, who represents the Melyn Ward. There was a good crowd who turned up to support the Trust, and listen to Keith make his debut speech, which was superb. Melin Trust was set up in 2002 to foster community development and regeneration in local areas. It is run by staff, trustees and, over the years, hundreds of volunteers have gained skills and confidence by taking part in the many projects run by the Trust. At the Christmas Lights ceremony, the Trust volunteers handed out mince pies and there was genuine delight at seeing so many old friends in person again after such a long time.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, I joined the virtual meeting of the Wales Co-operative Council to present my report on the work of the Co-operative Parliamentary Group. We have continued work on increasing protection for retail workers as they face increasing levels of violence, threats, and abuse at work. The UK Government has finally conceded to our campaign, led in the Commons by Alex Norris MP and his Private Members’ Bill. It will be bringing forward a U.K. Government Lords amendment that gives greater protection for all public-facing workers, including retail workers to the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill, which is currently in the Lords. This has been a core campaign for the Parliamentary Group, the wider Co-operative movement, and trade unions for many years, but we shall continue to press the UK Government to ensure the proposed legislation has the desired positive impact on retail workers.</p>
<p>I have been leading the campaign for the introduction of a UK Marcora Law that would give workers and employees the opportunity, the financial support, and advice, to buy-out all or part of their employer’s business when it is in crisis, and establish it as an employee-owned co-operative. In Italy this is done by giving workers their employment benefits as a lump sum advance to use as capital for the buy-out, plus support and advice from the Cooperazione Finanza Impresa (CFI) which runs Marcora Law on behalf of the Italian Government, to make sure buy-outs are successful. Following my Marcora Law Westminster Hall Debate on 8th September, Camillo De Berardinis Presidente of CFI, contacted me to say that he’d watched my debate and invited me to speak at the CFI’s 35th Anniversary, which I was honoured to accept. I shall continue to press the UK Government to introduce a UK Marcora Law and I have a 10-Minute Rule Bill entitled “Co-operatives (Employee Company Ownership) scheduled in the Commons for 11th January.</p>
<p>We have been actively opposing the sell-off of LV= one of Britain’s oldest and largest customer-owned business. The APPG for Mutuals, chaired by Gareth Thomas MP, of which I am treasurer, conducted an inquiry into the proposed sell-off of LV= and our report stated that the proposed sale to American venture capitalist firm Bain Capital would mean millions of LV= customers losing their ownership rights and ability to have a say in the company’s decisions. I’m pleased to report that LV= members have blocked the takeover, scuppering a year long campaign by the LV= board to secure backing for its preferred bidder Bain. Only 69% of the 174,240 members who cast ballots on 10th December approved of the £530m takeover, but the necessary threshold is 75%. LV= said that it would work swiftly to reassess its options, which could be merging with fellow mutual Royal London, one of the rival bidders, whose initial bid wasn’t accepted by the LV= board, despite being a higher bid at £540m, compared with Bain’s £530m. Gareth called for Chief Executive Mark Hartigan and Chairman Alan Cook to resign immediately. LV= confirmed that Mr Cook would be stepping down, but have not specified a date.</p>
<p>Week beginning 13th December</p>
<p>On Monday 13th I was honoured and privileged to present Reggie’s Law on behalf of the petitioner Richard Ackers, who had been given special permission by the Chair of Ways and Means to be present in the public gallery, because visitors are not allowed on the Parliamentary Estate under current Covid regulations. I told MPs that Richard started the petition after he bought his 12 week old Labrador puppy Reggie through a reputable website for his partner for Christmas and then realised that he had unknowingly contributed to illegal puppy farming. Richard concedes that he should have done more research before buying Reggie, and should have walked away, which would have prevented the seller getting more money to continue with acts of animal cruelty, but Reggie would still have died. Richard gave Reggie love, dignity, and pain relief throughout his very short life. Reggie fell ill 12 hours after Richard took him home and he died from Parvovirus two days later. Richard thought that Reggie was from St Helens, but when he returned to the seller’s address, the house was empty. Richard discovered that the microchip number for Reggie did not match the documentation given to Richard and it was registered to Dublin. Richard thinks Reggie was illegally shipped to the UK. Richard’s petition gathered over 109,000 signatures and many MPs attended the debate to support Reggie’s Law, and tell their stories of their constituents who had been duped by online sellers, plus tragic cases of mistreatment of animals. The UK Government Parliamentary Minister, Under-Secretary of State for Agri-Innovation and Climate Adaption Jo Churchill MP, was very sympathetic and offered to meet Richard. I summed up the debate by thanking all members for their contributions and urged the Minister to legislate to prevent people suffering the heartbreak that Richard has, and I thanked Richard for his determination not to give up on Justice For Reggie.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 14th I spoke in a Westminster Hall Debate on the contribution of co-operative and mutual societies to the economy and public life. I took the opportunity to continue to highlight my campaign to press the UK Government to introduce a UK Marcora Law. I started by reminding members that Robert Owen, founder of our Co-operative movement, whose vision included villages of co-operation, a “New World Order” of mutual help and social equality, was born in Wales, in Newtown, Powys on 14th May 1771. Also that the Co-op Group can trace its roots back to the start of modern co-operation in Rochdale in 1844, and that 177 years later, the Group continues to put its members and their passions at the centre of its business with a focus on working with others – co-operating. And since it’s launch in 2016, the Group’s Local Community Fund has provided approaching £100m to over 20,000 local good causes, making it one of the largest funding mechanisms for charities in the UK. I told the Minister that too much power and wealth rest with a small number of investors, shareholders, and executives and that decisions are often made for the benefit of the powerful and wealthy, not for the benefit of communities, workers, consumers, and the environment. And that I believe the answer lies in Marcora Law. I referred to my Westminster Hall Debate on 8th September and provided Minister John Glen MP with more facts about the success of the Italian New Marcora Law operated by the CFI, but the Minister repeated his comments that he made in my debate, that the Italian economy is different to the UK, And the unemployment rate is higher in Italy.</p>
<p>But the Minister did offer to meet me to discuss Marcora Law, and I have written to him to request a meeting in the New Year.</p>
<p>As the vice-chair for the APPG Rail in Wales, I was delighted to be asked to chair the Zoom meeting to discuss “Women in Rail” (WIR) with guest speakers Christine Fernandez, Development Lead CAF and chair of WIR Wales, and Gemma Southgate, Social Media Manager TfW and committee member of WIR Wales. Christine and Gemma gave a joint presentation about the aims and objectives of WIR Wales, the role of women in rail, and the need for more women to work in a variety of roles across the rail sector. There are only 13% women in the Rail sector, and only 2-3% are drivers. Women in Rail was set up to create various initiatives to encourage more women to join the sector, including a mentoring programme, upskilling, a peer to peer network for senior women in rail, an EDI Charter, and has plans to engage with schools, colleges and apprenticeships.</p>
<p>As a member of the Panel of Chairs, I chaired Westminster Hall Debates on both Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday Sir Tony Lloyd MP, former Shadow Northern Ireland Shadow Cabinet Minister, led a debate on securing a veterinary agreement in the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sir Tony opened by taking us back to two years ago quoting Prime Minister Johnson who said about form-filling “tell them to ring up the Prime Minister and I will direct them to throw the form in the bin….there will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind. You will have unfettered access.” Sir Tony said that his debate was about the operation of the protocol, and it is irresponsible that two years on we have no solution, which is building up tensions and concerns in Northern Island. Sir Tony stated that we need to move on – to some form of trusted trader scheme.</p>
<p>The next debate was led by Ruth Cadbury MP and was about the Free Period Product Scheme for Schools and College in England. Ruth is chair of the APPG on Period Equality, and she welcomed the UK Government’s announcement on 26th November to extend the scheme for all of 2022. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education, Will Quince, responded by stating that people may think “what does this middle-aged bloke know or care about period products?” But he does care because he is passionate about ensuring that women and girls are supported in education and beyond.</p>

<p>On Thursday I chaired a three hour Back Bench Debate about preventing surgical fires in the NHS led by Jim Shannon MP who underlined the serious dangers of surgical fires to patients and clinicians. A surgical fire occurs in an operating theatre and has three elements: the ignition source, the fuel and the oxidiser. Ignition sources include electro-surgical units, fibre-optic light sources, and lasers. Fuels can be alcohol-based skin prepping agents used in excess. The oxidiser is an oxygen-rich environment in which nitrous oxide is also present.</p>
<p>Mr Shannon stated that the debate was about raising awareness and making sure that surgical fires no longer happen. Mr Shannon stated that nobody knows how common surgical fires are, because there is a large discrepancy between reporting across the UK and health is devolved. The UK Government accept there is an issue but they do not know the scale of the problem, because they are not monitoring or reporting surgical fires, but there is also a need for education and training. There is currently no national guidance or safety recommendations to prevent surgical fires in operating theatres. And surgical fires must become a “never event”. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Maria Caulfield MP, responded on behalf of the NHS in England, and stated that she was concerned that there is no central record of how many surgical fires are taking place, agreed that staff training is a priority, and offered to meet Mr Shannon to look at guidelines to make sure they come forward, because surgical fires can not become “never events” without national guidance or safety recommendations. The Minister ended by stating that she hopes to share some progress with members in the new year.</p>

<p>My week ended when I attended the Advent 4 service at St David’s Church in Neath, and as usual I was given the warmest welcome. Reverend Stuart Ghezzi gave a wonderful sermon about the importance that greetings play in our life, and how we have adapted our greetings in Covid times. It was so good to see Neath Benefice Secretary Helen, Rector’s Warden Paul, and many members of the congregation who have become dear friends over the many years that I have been a member of Neath Benefice. Many thanks go to Canon Rector Linda Newman for doing a wonderful job at leading the Neath Benefice during such challenging times.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schools in Lincolnshire will receive £50million in extra funding next year, as part of a £4 billion funding boost from the Conservative Government across the country.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funding per pupil will increase nationally by five per cent in real terms from next year, giving significant increases for every pupil in every school.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A record £1 billion extra will be spent to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, so that all young people can reach their full potential.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that schools in Lincolnshire will receive £648 million in funding next year, a boost of £50million as part of the Conservative Government’s £4 billion increase in spending for schools across the country.</p>
<p>The £4 billion extra funding for school delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment when entering Downing Street, when he pledged to level up school funding by pledging over £14 billion for primary and secondary schools by 2022-23.</p>
<p>The £50million extra funding can use for hiring specialist teachers, providing training, and purchasing school supplies including textbooks.</p>
<p>The total extra funding for schools means mainstream schools will receive £41.7 billion in 2022-23, an increase of 5.8 per cent per pupil. Every primary school will receive at least £4,362 per pupil, and every secondary school at least £5,669 per pupil.</p>
<p>Matt Warman has also commended the Conservative Government’s targeted £1 billion boost to funding for special educational needs and disabilities, which is a record 13 per cent increase on this year’s funding.</p>
<p>The extra funding will help schools, councils, and other specialist providers provide the right care and support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities – so that every child receives the help they need to learn and fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>The increases in school funding follows the investment of nearly £5 billion in education recovery, which includes £1.5 billion on tutoring in schools and colleges across the country to help children and young people catch up on lost learning during the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<p>“No child or young person should be limited by where they grow up – they should be supported to get a world class education at school.</p>
<p>“The £50million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire will help them to hire more teachers, get materials to support pupils learning, and support pupils with special needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>“As we build back fairer, this funding will ensure every young person can receive the education they deserve so they can fulfil their potential.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Schools Minister Robin Walker said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Every pupil, no matter where they grow up or go to school, deserves an excellent education and the chance to fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>“This £4 billion funding boost delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment to level up school funding – giving significant increases to every pupil in every school – and taken alongside our ambitious education recovery plan with additional investment of almost £5 billion, will support every young person to catch up following the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This additional investment also represents a significant boost to high needs funding, helping local authorities support pupils with special educational needs, and helping to ensure all young people can thrive and succeed.”</p></blockquote>

              <h2><a href="http://www.ianmearns.org.uk/2021/12/17/votes-on-covid-measures/">Votes on Covid Measures</a></h2>
              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I have received a large volume of emails in connection with the further restrictions covering a range of views and suggestions and the Government had repeatedly amended the format of the vote which took place on Tuesday evening. I have noted the contents of every email when forming my view and hope to set out below how I voted on each aspect.</p>
<p><strong>A. Face Coverings in a list of indoor venues </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the re-imposition of masks and face coverings in most settings for those who are able to wear them. There is evidence to suggest that masks are effective in reducing the spread of airborne based viruses and the wearing of masks is uncomfortable at worst for the vast majority of people. If masks provide any protection at all, they are worth persevering with and I was concerned and disappointed to see the Government abandon this mandate earlier in the year, especially when it comes to public transport. I therefore voted in favour of this measure.</p>
<p><strong>B. Self Isolation Changes (Using lateral flow tests instead of isolation for vaccinated contacts of Covid-19 cases) </strong></p>
<p>Quite recently to Government announced that they would be returning to fixed isolation for all contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19 where it is suspected that the positive case was the new omicron variant. The Government then proposed to move away from this to allow those who are vaccinated to continue to take daily lateral flow tests in lieu of isolation.</p>
<p>In my view, as I will set out in greater detail below, the early data suggests that while maximum vaccination provides ample protection against symptoms and illness associated with the omicron variant of Covid-19, there is little data to suggest that the vaccination reduces transmission of the variant. As such, I feel that a negative lateral flow test provides at least a degree of certainty that the virus is not present, and as such this should be sufficient to allow people to continue normal life. I would add that should any person have any symptoms whatsoever, they must seek a PCR test as soon as possible and isolate until they receive their results.</p>
<p><strong> C. Covid Status Certification </strong></p>
<p>I’m fundamentally opposed to any certification programme which does not allow for those who have not been, or can not be vaccinated from obtaining the certification required to access venues and events accordingly. Additionally, I’m opposed to the introduction of any certificate based entry system without the subsequent evidence to show that it would be effective, how it would be effective and why it is necessary.</p>
<p>At present, the data appears to show that while the omicron variant is highly transmissible, vaccination status does not appear to provide any or much protection against transmission and the Government have continued to ignore calls to produce the evidence required to show that this type of scheme would be effective. As a starting point, the Government have failed to convince me, through data, that a scheme to restrict entry based largely on vaccination status is an effective public health measure. I was pleased to see the option to complete a lateral flow test instead, and would have ordinarily been more inclined to support such a scheme on this basis, but for the two issues set out below.</p>
<p>First, it can not be right to bring in a form of certification like this which allows for individuals to satisfy the criteria through the completion of a LFT, on the same week where it would appear almost impossible to obtain LFT devices. Such a scheme in these circumstances, therefore, becomes an actual vaccine passport, which I fundamentally oppose.</p>
<p>Second, even if the distribution of LFT devices was to be resolved, I can not in good conscience vote in favour of a scheme which places huge constraints on the hospitality sector in particular, and larger venues who have been the hardest hit since March 2020; without any discernible support through either financial backing or infrastructure, during the busiest period of the year for many of these businesses.</p>
<p>Without the data to back up such a scheme and show its effectiveness, without proper support for the businesses and employees who are being forced to administer this scheme and without ready access to LFT devices, I felt that I could not support this introduction.</p>
<p>However, should the above be satisfied, I would be happy to support such a scheme in the future and for this reason, I abstained.</p>
<p><strong>D. Extension of Mandatory Vaccination for NHS and Care Workers</strong></p>
<p>I’m generally opposed to mandatory vaccination schemes across society, especially where measures can be introduced to placate the need for vaccinations.</p>
<p>In this instance, as referred to above, it is not clear that vaccinations help prevent transmission of the latest variant to any notable degree, and as such, I’m concerned that vaccination status alone is providing false reassurance of safety. I understand that the alternative plans would be to continue to test through both LFT and PCR all staff who are working in and around the health and care sectors and I completely agree with this. It is imperative that we protect those who are most vulnerable and the best way to do that is to ensure that every precaution is taken to prevent the virus being transmitted from staff to patients. Given the current data, I would think this would be much better achieved through testing than vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we are already facing huge vacancy numbers across the health and care sector at a time where both services are under excessive strain. It would be the worst possible time to lose further staff through a scheme of this nature. I could not, therefore, support this action.</p>
<p>I hope the above sets out my view on the most recent vote in Parliament.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

Expert advice is important but decisions must be made by those we elect, who are democratically accountable.

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>I know that there are strong views on both sides of the argument about the new restrictions, but for the purposes of this message I thought it just helpful to explain what is now required.</p>
<p>There are three major changes in effect from now for the next few weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face coverings are required by law in most indoor settings outside the home. This does not apply to hospitality settings where you are eating or drinking.</li>
<li>People who can work from home are now being asked to do so.</li>
<li>From today, certain venues and events will be required by law to check that all visitors aged 18 years or over are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative test in the last 48 hours, or have an exemption. This includes nightclubs and big sporting and entertainment events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Isolation</h2>
<p>The self-isolation requirements have also changed. If you test positive for Covid you are still required to isolate for a period of ten days, even if you do not have symptoms. But if you live with or come into contact with someone who tests positive, you do not have to isolate but are instead asked to take a daily lateral flow test to continue to check that you are not positive yourself.</p>
<h2>Travel to Africa</h2>
<p>For those seeking to travel to parts of Africa, the system of hotel quarantine has now been scrapped. Everyone travelling abroad is still required to take a lateral flow or PCR test before their return to the UK, and is required to take a PCR test on their return and to isolate until they get the (hopefully negative) result. You then only need to carry on isolating if the test is positive.</p>
<p>All the latest details and guidance can be found <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#what-has-changed">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Lateral Flow Tests</h2>
<p>I know that there have been some issues locally with the supply of home tests. I have spoken to local pharmacists and ministers about this, and there is no overall shortage of the tests, though the sudden increase in demand means that there has been a problem getting the tests distributed quickly enough. Hopefully that is on the way to being resolved.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 Booster Programme</h2>
<p>Most people over the age of 50 have now had their booster jabs in our area, but the expansion of the booster programme to all other adults means a significant increase in the demand locally and it will take a bit of time for the local health service to get all of this sorted. I would like to extend my thanks to all of those involved in the programme and particularly to people who have come forward this week to volunteer to help accelerate the programme.</p>
<p>I will continue to provide updates as and when I have more information that I hope will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Tuesday 14 December, Preet Kaur Gill MP has opened a debate in the House of Commons to challenge the Government on funding for neighbourhood policing and its fair funding across the West Midlands.</p>
<p>In her speech she called on the Government to give local Police forces a fighting chance of tackling crime following 11 years of Conservative Government cuts to the West Midlands which has seen more than 2,220 officers lose their jobs, a further £175 million of funding removed from West Midlands Police’s budget and more than 20 Police stations earmarked for closure.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “We’ve seen how crime across Birmingham and the West Midlands has increased dramatically over the last decade, and I worry about the future of policing should this continue. With these dramatic cuts to our neighbourhood policing, it comes as no surprise that the West Midlands has the fourth highest rate of crime in the country, and it is residents that are feeling the impact and are being let down when they most need help.</p>
<p>“Neighbourhood policing is all about preventing crime and building relationships in the communities where officers serve. However, the direct result of these funding cuts means that West Midlands Police are operating on a reactive basis.  Across Birmingham, we’re seeing neighbourhood Police officers coming off shift at 11pm which means the safety of the whole city is left to central response. If you’re one of my constituents in Bartley Green or Quinton and are in a life-threatening situation, because you are so far out from the city centre, that’s at best a 15-minute wait. It simply isn’t good enough.”</p>
<p>This approach also has an impact on prosecution rates. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of crimes that end in a charge or court summons has halved, with justice for victims of violent offences at an even worse rate.</p>
<p>Gill continued, “Ultimately, all of this means that West Midlands Police can’t meet the demands for its services in protecting vulnerable people with the resources it has. That isn’t right and is why I’m proud to work alongside our PCC Simon Foster and my parliamentary colleagues to prioritise police officers, because it is police officers that keep you and your family safe. I hope this debate brings this disastrous approach to light and to fight for a policing service that is fit for the future.”</p>
<p>The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster said, "Reckless government cuts have dismantled neighbourhood policing, with numbers dropping in the West Midlands from 1,821 in 2010 to 760 in 2018. That was a big mistake. It was counter-productive and a false economy. We have all been being paying the price with less justice, safety and security. This is why I have launched a cross-party campaign for a fair funding deal for West Midlands Police to help us get officer numbers back to 2010 levels.</p>
<p>"My core mission during my term of office will be to rebuild community policing. Community policing is the bedrock of British policing. It embodies the principle of policing by consent on which policing in our country is built. It provides the preventative, proactive, problem solving and visible policing that the people and communities of the West Midlands want.</p>
<p>"I will begin the crucial work of rebuilding it to keep people, their families and communities safe. As a start, on my mission to rebuild community policing, I will aim to put 450 additional officers into neighbourhood policing, strengthening the local bonds between the public and the police and improving our ability to proactively solve local issues before they become critical. Much more government support is needed to get back to the community policing levels we had a decade ago."</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

              <h3>Emma Lewell-Buck (South Shields)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>



<p>You can read my full speech <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-10-27/debates/2FE67ECE-5C5C-4910-876B-9610627E645A/SewagePollutionWhitburn">here.</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

First of all, thank you to everyone who has sent such kind messages to me after last night’s result in Birmingham Northfield. Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
