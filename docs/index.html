<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients. You can find further information about the vaccination programme on the NHS website. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccination-programme/?fbclid=IwAR1fpUmKNp4yRr6QmFb7LJiCh5LvoLTJx6-Qah39dx87VAq6ASeUi1ZiApM" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/&#8230;/covid-19-vaccination&#8230;/</a>This is more progress on the path to recovery and a bit of good news as we keep up the fight against C-19. </p>

<p>Last week I visited <a href="https://www.barleycroft.leicester.sch.uk/">Barley Croft Primary School</a>, in Beaumont Leys, where they held their Christmas Assembly.</p>
<p>Pupils and staff at the school also said goodbye to their headteacher, Kevin Lacey, after 14 years at the school. During his time as Head, Kevin has led the school to great success including improving its Ofsted rating from “Inadequate” to “Good”; overseeing a full refurbishment of the school; and developing a culture where children are inspired to enjoy learning, so they achieve their best.</p>
<p>I am really sorry to be saying goodbye to Kevin. He has been an absolutely inspirational Head, and I have loved seeing the fantastic, innovative way he has helped children engage with learning. I know how hard he has worked, and how much he has put into the school, so I wish him the very best on his retirement.</p>

<p>We soon will need to put the worst of the pandemic measures behind us and concentrate on the promotion of prosperity for the many. Controlling the disease should rest on the offer of vaccinations, better treatments, individual decisions about reducing the risk of infection and better air extraction and cleaning in public buildings.</p>
<p>The Treasury needs to acknowledge that its policy is going to squeeze the economy too much in the first half of next year. If they persist with their raft of tax rises in April, hitting just when energy prices rocket with the shifting of the price caps, we will see an unwelcome relapse in confidence, incomes and output.</p>
<p>The Treasury should announce now that it will not impose the hike in national Insurance, a tax on jobs and on take home pay, at the peak of the cost of living troubles. It should remove VAT on domestic fuel to ease the large rise in energy costs for consumers.</p>
<p>The Treasury should work with the Business department to increase the supply of domestic energy. Gas is a so called transition fuel which will be much needed this decade before new nuclear and other reliable carbon free electricity comes on stream. Gas also remains the dominant way of heating homes, as people are not yet ready to adopt electric and heat pumps based home heating. The government should give the go ahead of additional UK gas production, starting with the Jackdaw field and other projects ready to go. The government should also commission more gas storage capacity to help smooth wild fluctuations in  spot market prices of gas.</p>
<p>The government should procure more reliable electricity supply from domestic sources as we are too dependent on imports when there is little wind.The Treasury should work with the Environment Department to fashion support schemes to promote more food production at home instead of offering money to prevent farming here, supporting imports.</p>
<p>All the time government advisers tell us to avoid social contact the Treasury needs to offer help to social contact service businesses.It needs at least to continue  business rates relief and lower VAT, and should offer direct assistance for cash flow problems of otherwise solvent businesses.</p>

<p>Tim said: <em>"I've set myself a target of running a minimum of three miles each day, but I'm hoping to get a few half marathons in there too!</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"I'm proud to be taking on this challenge in aid of our brilliant local mental health charity Wave Forward.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"With more lockdowns and uncertainty, it's been another really tough year on young people. So the work that charities like Wave Forward do in supporting their mental health and has never been more important."</em>
</p>
<p>The Chair of Trustees at Wave Forward, Ramin Salehi said: <em>"We're thrilled to have Tim take on this running challenge as part of our Winter Wave of activities aimed at not just fundraising but raising awareness of how important getting outdoors and getting active is, especially in these darker, colder months, for maintaining and/or improving mental health.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"We're excited to follow Tim's journey through January and all the different running routes he's going to tackle."</em>

              <h3>Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>Schools in Lincolnshire will receive £50million in extra funding next year, as part of a £4 billion funding boost from the Conservative Government across the country.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funding per pupil will increase nationally by five per cent in real terms from next year, giving significant increases for every pupil in every school.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A record £1 billion extra will be spent to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, so that all young people can reach their full potential.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the news that schools in Lincolnshire will receive £648 million in funding next year, a boost of £50million as part of the Conservative Government’s £4 billion increase in spending for schools across the country.</p>
<p>The £4 billion extra funding for school delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment when entering Downing Street, when he pledged to level up school funding by pledging over £14 billion for primary and secondary schools by 2022-23.</p>
<p>The £50million extra funding can use for hiring specialist teachers, providing training, and purchasing school supplies including textbooks.</p>
<p>The total extra funding for schools means mainstream schools will receive £41.7 billion in 2022-23, an increase of 5.8 per cent per pupil. Every primary school will receive at least £4,362 per pupil, and every secondary school at least £5,669 per pupil.</p>
<p>Matt Warman has also commended the Conservative Government’s targeted £1 billion boost to funding for special educational needs and disabilities, which is a record 13 per cent increase on this year’s funding.</p>
<p>The extra funding will help schools, councils, and other specialist providers provide the right care and support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities – so that every child receives the help they need to learn and fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>The increases in school funding follows the investment of nearly £5 billion in education recovery, which includes £1.5 billion on tutoring in schools and colleges across the country to help children and young people catch up on lost learning during the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<p>“No child or young person should be limited by where they grow up – they should be supported to get a world class education at school.</p>
<p>“The £50million funding boost for schools in Lincolnshire will help them to hire more teachers, get materials to support pupils learning, and support pupils with special needs and disabilities.</p>
<p>“As we build back fairer, this funding will ensure every young person can receive the education they deserve so they can fulfil their potential.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Schools Minister Robin Walker said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Every pupil, no matter where they grow up or go to school, deserves an excellent education and the chance to fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>“This £4 billion funding boost delivers on the Prime Minister’s commitment to level up school funding – giving significant increases to every pupil in every school – and taken alongside our ambitious education recovery plan with additional investment of almost £5 billion, will support every young person to catch up following the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This additional investment also represents a significant boost to high needs funding, helping local authorities support pupils with special educational needs, and helping to ensure all young people can thrive and succeed.”</p></blockquote>

<div id="fb-root"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Christmas approaching fast we all want to have time with our family and friends. Last year the vast majority of us followed the rules; staying away from loved ones when we most wanted to be with them. We did this to keep Bristol safe from the rapidly rising Covid-19 rates. I know that this sacrifice meant some of you missed final Christmases with relatives and that pain will still be felt today. That heartache must only have been intensified by revelations that the Prime Minister held several parties in Downing Street. Obviously, he believes that the rules didn’t apply to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a dangerous time for our country. To have someone in charge that has taken a wreaking ball to public trust is not someone who is fit to lead. But I implore you to take extra care this winter to ensure we can protect the NHS from being overwhelmed by Omicron.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst we may not have faith in this Prime Minister, we do in the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty. He is someone of integrity, expertise and compassion for keeping our country safe. Professor Whitty has told us to minimise contact with those we don’t necessarily need to see and prioritise those who we desperately want to meet over Christmas. I thoroughly endorse his pleas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep safe, get your booster jab and remember that together we can secure the better future we all yearn for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business of holding the Government to account stretches far beyond Covid-19 and this week I took part in legislation to argue against the proposed scrapping of trailer safety tests for drivers on our roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government are seeking to remove the need for car and trailer tests required for drivers who tow heavy trailers. The Government continue to push the notion that this is needed to increase the number of driving examiners to increase the number of HGV tests available. However, all evidence shows that we have excess capacity in our testing regime. Moreover, I have the backing of the Road Haulers Association and the Association of British Insurers that these measures are dangerous and not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government are now unleashing thousands of untrained, unsafe and unqualified drivers of trailers on to our roads. It really does beggar belief that we are still doing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my new role acting as the Shadow Minister for Social Care, providing maternity leave cover, I took part in a virtual roundtable. We were joined by a large number of influential expert stakeholders in the sector who shared their views on how we can develop a social care system that works for all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we support and fund social care, we can help families stay together, children enjoy a childhood, the elderly grow old with dignity and love. This is the society that Labour want to build and working with stakeholders within society is how we achieve that.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met with other members of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee this week to hear from the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman about the impact of the pandemic on their ability to carry out their work. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman is an incredibly important body which exists to hold the public sector to account and works to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money for the work within the public sector. It is therefore incredibly important that their work has continued throughout the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to join BBC News on Wednesday evening to discuss the new Covid protection measures. It was extraordinary to see a hundred Tory MPs marching through the no voting lobby in Parliament this week against these precautions. The Prime Minister is now rudderless and unable to lead his party or government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, Labour stood up when the Conservative Party stood aside. Without Labour votes, including mine, these Covid protection measures wouldn’t have passed and we would have been in a perilous situation as a country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that this Christmas seems to be a case of history repeating itself with Covid infections on the rise. This will no doubt be another tough yuletide. But I want everyone in Bristol South to remember that together better times will be with us. If we follow the rules, showing an example to those who do not, we can protect our loved ones from this horrendous pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you a safe Christmas. Let’s all look out for each other so we can have a better 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As ever, if there are issues you want to raise with me as your local MP, please get in touch by emailing Karin.smyth.mp@parliament.uk or by calling 0117 953 3575. </span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/12/17/weekly-round-up-12/">Weekly Round-Up</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has condemned Tory Ministers after a brutal 3.8% train fares hike was announced this morning.</p>
<p>Labour has compared the costs on over 180 train routes between when the Conservatives came to power and the projected new prices that will be implemented this January 2020.</p>
<p>And this new analysis shows that on average, commuters in Greater Manchester will be paying 47% more than in 2010 for a season ticket.<br />
In 2010, the average commuter in Greater Manchester would have paid an estimated £1987 for their season ticket. Labour analysis now estimates that in 2022 the average commuter will pay £2931 – an increase of almost £1000 – for their season ticket.</p>
<p>The average commuter nationwide faces paying a staggering £3,263 for their season ticket &#8211; £1069, or 49% more, than in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>New figures released today by Labour show:</strong></p>
<p>• Average fares will rise to 48.9% more than they were in 2010.</p>
<p>• That some commuters will be paying over £3,900 more to travel to work than in 2010.</p>
<p>• Average fares have risen twice as fast as wages.</p>
<p><strong>Louise Haigh MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This brutal Tory fare hike will be a nightmare before Christmas for millions of passengers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Families already facing soaring taxes and bills will now be clobbered with an eyewatering rise in the cost of the commute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many will wonder what planet Ministers are on if they think people can afford this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People up and down this country are paying the price for a cost-of-living crisis made in Downing Street.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Many families across Denton and Reddish are already struggling to make ends meet this Christmas, and rather than give them a helping hand the Tories have piled on more misery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greater Manchester has had to bear the brunt of years of broken promises. We were promised ‘Northern Powerhouse Rail’ to bring high speed rail travel to the north. We were lied to. Now, to make matters worse, not only are we not getting the requisite investment in transport infrastructure, we’re having to pay more for it!</p>

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I have received a large volume of emails in connection with the further restrictions covering a range of views and suggestions and the Government had repeatedly amended the format of the vote which took place on Tuesday evening. I have noted the contents of every email when forming my view and hope to set out below how I voted on each aspect.</p>
<p><strong>A. Face Coverings in a list of indoor venues </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the re-imposition of masks and face coverings in most settings for those who are able to wear them. There is evidence to suggest that masks are effective in reducing the spread of airborne based viruses and the wearing of masks is uncomfortable at worst for the vast majority of people. If masks provide any protection at all, they are worth persevering with and I was concerned and disappointed to see the Government abandon this mandate earlier in the year, especially when it comes to public transport. I therefore voted in favour of this measure.</p>
<p><strong>B. Self Isolation Changes (Using lateral flow tests instead of isolation for vaccinated contacts of Covid-19 cases) </strong></p>
<p>Quite recently to Government announced that they would be returning to fixed isolation for all contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19 where it is suspected that the positive case was the new omicron variant. The Government then proposed to move away from this to allow those who are vaccinated to continue to take daily lateral flow tests in lieu of isolation.</p>
<p>In my view, as I will set out in greater detail below, the early data suggests that while maximum vaccination provides ample protection against symptoms and illness associated with the omicron variant of Covid-19, there is little data to suggest that the vaccination reduces transmission of the variant. As such, I feel that a negative lateral flow test provides at least a degree of certainty that the virus is not present, and as such this should be sufficient to allow people to continue normal life. I would add that should any person have any symptoms whatsoever, they must seek a PCR test as soon as possible and isolate until they receive their results.</p>
<p><strong> C. Covid Status Certification </strong></p>
<p>I’m fundamentally opposed to any certification programme which does not allow for those who have not been, or can not be vaccinated from obtaining the certification required to access venues and events accordingly. Additionally, I’m opposed to the introduction of any certificate based entry system without the subsequent evidence to show that it would be effective, how it would be effective and why it is necessary.</p>
<p>At present, the data appears to show that while the omicron variant is highly transmissible, vaccination status does not appear to provide any or much protection against transmission and the Government have continued to ignore calls to produce the evidence required to show that this type of scheme would be effective. As a starting point, the Government have failed to convince me, through data, that a scheme to restrict entry based largely on vaccination status is an effective public health measure. I was pleased to see the option to complete a lateral flow test instead, and would have ordinarily been more inclined to support such a scheme on this basis, but for the two issues set out below.</p>
<p>First, it can not be right to bring in a form of certification like this which allows for individuals to satisfy the criteria through the completion of a LFT, on the same week where it would appear almost impossible to obtain LFT devices. Such a scheme in these circumstances, therefore, becomes an actual vaccine passport, which I fundamentally oppose.</p>
<p>Second, even if the distribution of LFT devices was to be resolved, I can not in good conscience vote in favour of a scheme which places huge constraints on the hospitality sector in particular, and larger venues who have been the hardest hit since March 2020; without any discernible support through either financial backing or infrastructure, during the busiest period of the year for many of these businesses.</p>
<p>Without the data to back up such a scheme and show its effectiveness, without proper support for the businesses and employees who are being forced to administer this scheme and without ready access to LFT devices, I felt that I could not support this introduction.</p>
<p>However, should the above be satisfied, I would be happy to support such a scheme in the future and for this reason, I abstained.</p>
<p><strong>D. Extension of Mandatory Vaccination for NHS and Care Workers</strong></p>
<p>I’m generally opposed to mandatory vaccination schemes across society, especially where measures can be introduced to placate the need for vaccinations.</p>
<p>In this instance, as referred to above, it is not clear that vaccinations help prevent transmission of the latest variant to any notable degree, and as such, I’m concerned that vaccination status alone is providing false reassurance of safety. I understand that the alternative plans would be to continue to test through both LFT and PCR all staff who are working in and around the health and care sectors and I completely agree with this. It is imperative that we protect those who are most vulnerable and the best way to do that is to ensure that every precaution is taken to prevent the virus being transmitted from staff to patients. Given the current data, I would think this would be much better achieved through testing than vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we are already facing huge vacancy numbers across the health and care sector at a time where both services are under excessive strain. It would be the worst possible time to lose further staff through a scheme of this nature. I could not, therefore, support this action.</p>
<p>I hope the above sets out my view on the most recent vote in Parliament.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

<p>This week Parliament discussed neighbourhood policing.</p>



<p>It took me back to my old boss Charles Clarke who, as Home Secretary in 2005, wanted to increase police numbers and lower costs by reshaping and reducing the overall number of forces.</p>



<p>He&#8217;d received a report from Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspector of Constabulary arguing that the existing structure wasn&#8217;t fit for purpose.</p>



<p>It recommended creating strategic constabularies of sufficient size to provide effective neighbourhood policing and tackle organised crime.</p>



<p>The plan was opposed by Tory politicians and the Association of Police Authorities.</p>



<p>We still have broadly the same structure 17 years later, although now bolstered by Police and Crime Commissioners, making reform less likely and the politicisation of policing more common.</p>



<p>I regularly hear from frustrated constituents about the small number of prosecutions for those who burgle our homes, steal our cars and threaten our loved ones.</p>



<p>Falling police numbers are part of the explanation, but do Charles Clarke&#8217;s ideas offer a further clue about the failure to tackle these crimes and the collapse of the principle of neighbourhood policing so painstakingly established by Labour Home Secretaries between 1997 and 2010?</p>



<p>Even if Boris Johnson keeps his promise and puts some money back, we&#8217;ll still end up with 1,000 fewer officers than in 2010 and continue to suffer from an unfair formula which drives up our council tax while giving us a smaller share of government funding than places like neighbouring Warwickshire.</p>



<p>Consequently, their police numbers are increasing while ours have fallen.</p>



<p>We need two things: quality detectives to tackle cybercrime that empties bank accounts, stop modern slave traders and smash criminal gangs; we also need police to tackle burglary, vehicle theft and anti-social behaviour.</p>



<p>If neighbourhood policing is forced to compete with organised crime for resources, it will always be the poor relation.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already lost 50% of neighbourhood officers. Perhaps now is the time for reform.</p>



<p>Why not a two-tier system with ring-fenced resources protecting the numbers policing our streets, gathering local intelligence and keeping the community safe and a, separately funded, second tier of specialised officers able to wage war on organised crime?</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>I know that there are strong views on both sides of the argument about the new restrictions, but for the purposes of this message I thought it just helpful to explain what is now required.</p>
<p>There are three major changes in effect from now for the next few weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face coverings are required by law in most indoor settings outside the home. This does not apply to hospitality settings where you are eating or drinking.</li>
<li>People who can work from home are now being asked to do so.</li>
<li>From today, certain venues and events will be required by law to check that all visitors aged 18 years or over are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative test in the last 48 hours, or have an exemption. This includes nightclubs and big sporting and entertainment events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Isolation</h2>
<p>The self-isolation requirements have also changed. If you test positive for Covid you are still required to isolate for a period of ten days, even if you do not have symptoms. But if you live with or come into contact with someone who tests positive, you do not have to isolate but are instead asked to take a daily lateral flow test to continue to check that you are not positive yourself.</p>
<h2>Travel to Africa</h2>
<p>For those seeking to travel to parts of Africa, the system of hotel quarantine has now been scrapped. Everyone travelling abroad is still required to take a lateral flow or PCR test before their return to the UK, and is required to take a PCR test on their return and to isolate until they get the (hopefully negative) result. You then only need to carry on isolating if the test is positive.</p>
<p>All the latest details and guidance can be found <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#what-has-changed">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Lateral Flow Tests</h2>
<p>I know that there have been some issues locally with the supply of home tests. I have spoken to local pharmacists and ministers about this, and there is no overall shortage of the tests, though the sudden increase in demand means that there has been a problem getting the tests distributed quickly enough. Hopefully that is on the way to being resolved.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 Booster Programme</h2>
<p>Most people over the age of 50 have now had their booster jabs in our area, but the expansion of the booster programme to all other adults means a significant increase in the demand locally and it will take a bit of time for the local health service to get all of this sorted. I would like to extend my thanks to all of those involved in the programme and particularly to people who have come forward this week to volunteer to help accelerate the programme.</p>
<p>I will continue to provide updates as and when I have more information that I hope will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my December&nbsp;email newsletter. It&#8217;s been an eventful time&nbsp;for Amber Valley, with investments and changes in large national projects like HS2 and Rolls-Royce’s Small Modular Reactor’s affecting our locality greatly. There has also sadly been the rise of the Omicron Covid-19 variant, and the challenges this may bring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you will find updates on the newly published Integrated Rail Plan, the Government’s plans to develop Modular Nuclear Reactors with Rolls-Royce, my actions in parliament relating to standards in public life, and a few of the visits I have been invited on here in Amber Valley. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With regards to Covid-19, new restrictions recently introduced, and uncertainty around the new Omicron variant growing, <strong>I will be holding a virtual residents’ meeting via zoom tomorrow, Thursday 16 December, at 8PM</strong>. So, if you have any concerns or questions you would like to raise with me, please reply to this newsletter or email <a href="mailto:nigel@nigelmillsmp.com">nigel@nigelmillsmp.com</a> to request to take part in the meeting.</p>



<p><strong><u>Omicron &amp; Plan B:</u></strong></p>



<p>We have, since July, managed to cope with Covid with very few restrictions on normal life, and I sincerely hoped we could maintain that position in contrast to much of Europe, as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The number of cases has remained high, however, the vaccines have ensured that numbers requiring hospitalisation have remained at manageable levels and much lower than pre-vaccination.</p>



<p>This latter point is key, as we need hospitals not only to have the capacity to treat Covid patients but also others requiring urgent care and to start to clear the large backlog in planned care.</p>



<p>The new Omicron variant has sadly challenged this position. It is still too early to have a full understanding of this variant, even in South Africa let alone here, but there seems to be consensus that it spreads more quickly, and that 2 vaccine doses provide much less protection against infection. On the plus side, the variant does seem to be milder than the Delta variant – again, however, it is too early to be sure.</p>



<p>There seem to be 2 main problems we’re facing:</p>



<p>1)&nbsp;The new variant spreads much more quickly – currently doubling every 2 days. This means that the current level of restrictions that have kept the Delta variant at a high but stable level of infection, won’t contain Omicron, and if the current level of restrictions continue, we will very likely end up with much higher levels of infection in the coming weeks. It seems unlikely that the new variant will be sufficiently mild for there not to be more hospitalisations if infection levels are very much higher.</p>



<p>2)&nbsp;Without boosters, more of those infected will become seriously ill. The early data suggests that the 95% protection against serious illness offered by both the Pfizer and AZ jabs would be reduced to something like 75% &#8211; this would result in a 5-fold increase in the percentage needing medical attention. The booster restores much of this lost protection, hence the urgent need to roll them out.</p>



<p>The combination of more cases and a higher proportion needing medical care would inevitably lead to severe strain on the NHS. This will hopefully be mitigated if the variant does turn out to be milder, and the most vulnerable age groups have received a booster. In this current context though, I do agree with the Government that some more measures are needed to slow down the spread until we know more.</p>



<p>The new measures&nbsp;are in summary:</p>



<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Mask wearing in more public places;</p>



<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Advising those who can to work from home;</p>



<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring a negative test to attend the highest risk settings (eg nightclubs, large sporting events, indoor events with over 500 people). People can choose to show proof of vaccination instead but aren’t obliged to.</p>



<p>You can find the full new guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The measures in regard to the requirement to wear face coverings in more public spaces, proof of vaccination or a negative test for large venues, compulsory vaccination for NHS workers and rules around self-isolation were all voted on and approved by Parliament yesterday, and I voted in favour of these measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new measures will not close any settings, nor will they introduce limits on mixing. These measures are not as restrictive as those in many neighbouring countries – for example, Ireland requires covid certificates at all hospitality venues. These are measures as moderate as we can keep them while providing some more control on the virus.</p>



<p>I would also urge everyone to get boosted – I had mine last week – and to use a lateral flow test before seeing vulnerable people or attending large gatherings. Please do get tested if you have symptoms. What may be mild for you may not be for who you pass the virus on to. There is no need to panic or cancel Christmas, and if we all take sensible precautions, hopefully we won’t need more restrictions in the coming weeks.</p>



<p><strong><u>Integrated Rail Plan &amp; HS2 update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Throughout my time as MP for Amber Valley I have supported the Government’s proposed HS2 “y” route, linking the East Midlands with London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds. The East Midlands has one of the slowest mainline services in the country and has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment. I have always maintained that HS2 was a way of addressing this, speeding up journey times and adding new capacity, not only to London but also to the north, and to the west. In addition, the proposed stations at Toton and Chesterfield provided significant opportunities for regeneration and job creation.</p>



<p>The construction of HS2 has never been certain, with more reviews than I can recall culminating with the publication of the Integrated Rail Plan on 18 November that has made substantial changes to the original proposal. The “Y” route is now set to run to East Midlands Parkway (not Toton) with direct services continuing to Nottingham, Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield on the current mainline. This mainline will now be electrified all the way to Sheffield. And it is possible that a separate mainline station could be built at Toton, subject to match funding from the private sector.</p>



<p>These proposals do contain some advantages compared to the original HS2 plan, including direct services to Nottingham and Derby which should enable easier connection to stations in Amber Valley. The electrification of the mainline is long overdue and should be completed a lot sooner than the previous HS2 plan, however, this decision does make the recent purchase of a number of diesel/electric trains somewhat redundant.</p>



<p>I also welcome that some of the rolling stock will be built by Alsthom and Hitachi at what was the former Bombardier site in Derby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these advantages, I believe this announcement leaves the East Midlands worse off than if the original HS2 plan was carried through to fruition. Electrification had previously been promised to the East Midlands only for it to be scrapped soon after due to cost increases. By comparison, Nottinghamshire not only gets a new HS2 station, but also the promise of support for 2 other line extensions. It is clear to me that we need equivalent funding for Derbyshire infrastructure and that’s what I’ll be pressing for in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong><u>Rolls Royce &amp; Small Modular Nuclear Reactors:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was very pleased to recently learn of the Government’s plan to invest £210 million to back Derby based Rolls-Royce plc’s development of modular nuclear reactors. This Government investment is matched by £250 million from the private sector and will be used to design, test, and develop the Small Modular Reactors (SMR’s) which could be rolled out nationwide.</p>



<p>Each of these SMR’s will be manufactured in the UK and will be capable of powering up to one million homes. I have always believed that domestic nuclear power provides an opportunity for reliable, affordable, and low carbon energy, whilst also giving the UK greater energy independence and security. Our reliance on the availability of natural gas from abroad has made the UK vulnerable to price rises and supply issues. The Government’s move towards the introduction of these SMR’s should reduce our reliance on imported natural gas, and in the process create up to 40,000 high skilled jobs by 2050, many of which will likely be created in Derbyshire.</p>



<p>This is excellent news for Derbyshire, and the energy security, independence, and resilience of the UK more widely.</p>



<p><strong><u>Standards in Public Life:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know many of you are concerned about some of the events that have taken place in the house over recent weeks relating to standards in public life. I would like to take this opportunity to expand on some of these and explain my position and actions in the Commons.</p>



<p>On the 26 October, the Parliamentary Committee on Standards published a report which found that Owen Paterson had breached the MP’s Code of Conduct. The report concluded that Mr Paterson had repeatedly used his position as a Member of Parliament to promote companies through which he was employed as a consultant. In line with previous cases, the Committee’s report recommended that Mr Paterson be suspended from the service of the House for 30 sitting days.</p>



<p>Under current procedures, MPs are unable to appeal decisions made by the Parliamentary Committee on Standards, unlike other sectors of employment which provide an opportunity for the individual to appeal the decision taken by an employment tribunal. As a result of this inability to appeal, when the Commons voted on whether to suspend Mr Paterson, the Government enabled an amendment to be tabled, the Leadsom amendment, which proposed to retrospectively change the rules surrounding suspension. Effectively overturning the committee’s findings.</p>



<p>I could not support this amendment for the following reasons. Firstly, I had read the full report into Mr Paterson’s conduct, and I thought the process was fair. Secondly, I believed that creating a review of the standards process immediately after that process released its verdict, would give the impression to the public that the Government was trying to escape the verdict. And finally, the committee the Government proposed to replace the current Parliamentary Committee on Standards was developed at the last minute, without consultation, or engagement with other parties. And I believed that was not the correct way to develop an impartial standards process that the public can have confidence in. For these reasons, I voted against the Leadsom amendment.</p>



<p>I was however, heartened to see the Government change direction and not go ahead with the proposed retrospective changes to the parliamentary standards procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Visit to Eco Vape, Alfreton:</u></strong></p>



<p>Late last month, I was invited to visit Eco Vape Wholesale in Alfreton. The company was founded in 2014 and develops, manufactures, and retails e-cigarette liquids across the globe. At the centre of this world-wide distribution network is a 65,000 sq. ft. warehouse and manufacturing facility just outside Alfreton.</p>



<p>I was lucky enough to visit this Amber Valley manufacturer and get a tour of their facilities. It is always useful to hear the thoughts and concerns of local employers. And throughout my visit, it became clear to me that regulation of this growing industry needs to be enforced equally across the country. We can’t have good companies, that spend a lot of time and energy fully adhering to all relevant regulation, undercut by companies playing it fast and loose with people’s health.</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting White Ribbon Day:</u></strong></p>



<p>On 26 November, I visited Salcare to support White Ribbon Day. Salcare is a local charity founded in 1977 to provide something of a “one-stop shop” of support for the people of Amber Valley and Erewash. The charity’s central ethos of helping those most in need, regardless of their circumstances, has made them a pillar of the local community in Heanor.</p>



<p>I was joined there by Phil Cox, Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) Chair, and Brian Bilby, Derbyshire Constabulary’s Operational Force Lead for Domestic Violence, to raise awareness for White Ribbon Day and its primary aim of ending violence against women.</p>



<p>Domestic violence against women is a truly horrific crime which affects too many women across the country. I know the Government understands this, and as part of the £40 million funding boost announced in February 2021, £20.7 million was allocated by the Government to local community-based sexual violence and domestic abuse services. I welcomed this investment, as I believe that community-based services in particular are vital for the prevention and cessation of domestic violence.</p>



<p><strong><u>Work &amp; Pensions Committee update:</u></strong></p>



<p>As part of recent&nbsp;Work and Pensions Select Committee meetings, I engaged with Neil Couling, Change Director General of Universal Credit. I questioned Mr Couling regarding fraud and error within the current Universal Credit (UC) system, particularly with regards to self-employment. With UC fraud and error being on the rise recently, I wanted to determine whether this trend was a temporary symptom of the pandemic, or a growing system problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was assured by Mr Couling that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) believes the driving force behind the increase in fraud and error is indeed a symptom of the pandemic. One that should be reduced with the reintroduction of the minimum income floor (MIF), which is used to calculate how much UC a self-employed individual is entitled to, given their income relative to the National Minimum Wage.</p>



<p>Mr Couling believes that as self-employed individuals made legitimate claims in the early days of the pandemic, after their work was effectively shut down by restrictions. Some claimants have returned to self-employed working, but have not reported that fact, and therefore, are continuing to receive UC payments they are not entitled to. However, once the MIF is reintroduced, the system should begin to capture those cases who have failed to disclose their return to employment.</p>



<p><strong><u>Street Watch:</u></strong></p>

              <h3>Preet Gill (Birmingham, Edgbaston)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Tuesday 14 December, Preet Kaur Gill MP has opened a debate in the House of Commons to challenge the Government on funding for neighbourhood policing and its fair funding across the West Midlands.</p>
<p>In her speech she called on the Government to give local Police forces a fighting chance of tackling crime following 11 years of Conservative Government cuts to the West Midlands which has seen more than 2,220 officers lose their jobs, a further £175 million of funding removed from West Midlands Police’s budget and more than 20 Police stations earmarked for closure.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “We’ve seen how crime across Birmingham and the West Midlands has increased dramatically over the last decade, and I worry about the future of policing should this continue. With these dramatic cuts to our neighbourhood policing, it comes as no surprise that the West Midlands has the fourth highest rate of crime in the country, and it is residents that are feeling the impact and are being let down when they most need help.</p>
<p>“Neighbourhood policing is all about preventing crime and building relationships in the communities where officers serve. However, the direct result of these funding cuts means that West Midlands Police are operating on a reactive basis.  Across Birmingham, we’re seeing neighbourhood Police officers coming off shift at 11pm which means the safety of the whole city is left to central response. If you’re one of my constituents in Bartley Green or Quinton and are in a life-threatening situation, because you are so far out from the city centre, that’s at best a 15-minute wait. It simply isn’t good enough.”</p>
<p>This approach also has an impact on prosecution rates. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of crimes that end in a charge or court summons has halved, with justice for victims of violent offences at an even worse rate.</p>
<p>Gill continued, “Ultimately, all of this means that West Midlands Police can’t meet the demands for its services in protecting vulnerable people with the resources it has. That isn’t right and is why I’m proud to work alongside our PCC Simon Foster and my parliamentary colleagues to prioritise police officers, because it is police officers that keep you and your family safe. I hope this debate brings this disastrous approach to light and to fight for a policing service that is fit for the future.”</p>
<p>The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster said, "Reckless government cuts have dismantled neighbourhood policing, with numbers dropping in the West Midlands from 1,821 in 2010 to 760 in 2018. That was a big mistake. It was counter-productive and a false economy. We have all been being paying the price with less justice, safety and security. This is why I have launched a cross-party campaign for a fair funding deal for West Midlands Police to help us get officer numbers back to 2010 levels.</p>
<p>"My core mission during my term of office will be to rebuild community policing. Community policing is the bedrock of British policing. It embodies the principle of policing by consent on which policing in our country is built. It provides the preventative, proactive, problem solving and visible policing that the people and communities of the West Midlands want.</p>
<p>"I will begin the crucial work of rebuilding it to keep people, their families and communities safe. As a start, on my mission to rebuild community policing, I will aim to put 450 additional officers into neighbourhood policing, strengthening the local bonds between the public and the police and improving our ability to proactively solve local issues before they become critical. Much more government support is needed to get back to the community policing levels we had a decade ago."</p>

<p>Yesterday in Parliament, along with fellow MPs, I questioned the policing minister in light of appalling bungled Met investigation into murders of 4 gay men. </p>



<p>With gay hate crime rising, we got alarming complacency from Minister:  unbelievable that he is refusing to consider proper inquiry into homophobia in police forces across the country, and he could not even answer me on what new guidelines have been issued since these tragic events  and whether they are being effectively followed. </p>

<p>Judith was delighted to hear that local Bradford South charity Sandale Trust has received funding from Morrison&#8217;s Foundation to support their community.</p>



<p>The funding will help the Sandale Community Development Trust, based in Buttershaw,&nbsp;to offer twice-weekly drop-in sessions at their community hub for residents who have been experiencing isolation, helping them to meet other people and offering the opportunity to gain new life skills and take part in volunteering roles.</p>



<p>Training courses will also be available on first aid and mental health awareness, providing users with skills that build confidence and will have a lasting impact long after the project.</p>



<p><strong>Judith said:</strong></p>



<p>“The team at Sandale Trust work at the heart of the community in Buttershaw and Woodside and offer a wide range of community activities that put people first.</p>



<p>&#8220;Through the pandemic, their efforts to provide free school meals, food parcels, and work with isolated members in our community has been a lifeline for many and has doubtless saved lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Supported by this Morrisons Foundation grant, they are now leading the way locally in helping hard-hit families as we recover.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was delighted to endorse their application, which will see Sandale provide space, support and training to bring residents together and build resilience in the community.”</p>

<p>My week began as a member of the Delegated Legislation Committee that met to discuss the Draft Statutory Instrument entitled “The Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 (Amendment to Schedule 3) (England) Order 2021” which sought to extend the scope of the Primary Authority scheme that provides a statutory framework for a business to form a partnership with a local authority in order to receive support in relation to specific areas of regulation, including in the context of a future pandemic. This instrument proposes to ensure that the Primary Authority scheme delivers its potential benefits more widely, enabling businesses, local authorities and consumers to benefit from increased consistency in the delivery of regulations made under this legislation and further reducing the burdens for businesses. The members of the committee questioned the Minister on the contents and implementation of this instrument before it passed without a vote.</p>
<p>As a member of the Parliamentary Panel of Chairs, I chaired the Delegated Legislation Committee which met to discuss the Draft Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures TPIM Act 2011 (Continuation) Order2021, which would provide for the continuation of the Secretary of State’s TPIM powers, which are due to expire <span dir="ltr">on 13th December 2021</span>, for 5 years <span dir="ltr">until 14th December 2026</span>. TPIMs are civil measures used to manage the threat posed by terrorists who cannot be prosecuted for a terrorism-related offence or deported in the case of foreign nationals. The 2011 Act provides the Home Secretary with the power to impose certain measures on an individual whom she reasonably believes has been involved in terrorism-related activity that may put the public at risk. The members of the committee unanimously supported the continuation.</p>
<p>I joined the virtual drop-in meeting held to mark Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest common cancer and affects over 10,000 people a year across the UK and three in five are diagnosed at a late stage. Over half die within three months of diagnosis. The symptoms are very distressing, unable to digest food, starving the body of nutrients and calories, leading to malnutrition, loss of muscle mass, and rapid weight loss. The MPs in the meeting split up into break-out groups to have an in depth briefing from the officers of Pancreatic Cancer UK and hear from a person who has been taking the life saving medication Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT), which is a tablet that replaces the digestive enzymes that people with pancreatic cancer cannot produce, to help digest food, improve quality of life and gain the strength needed to undergo life-saving treatment. Currently only one in two people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are being prescribed PERT, despite it being certified by NICE because it prolongs the lives of people with pancreatic cancer far beyond the average life expectancy of 3 months. The cost of PERT medication is only £7 per tablet, but it appears that many health care workers do not know about PERT and so it is not being prescribed. Therefore, we need an awareness raising campaign because many people with pancreatic cancer could be taking PERT which will prolong their lives. We heard from a person who has been taking PERT for many years and she told us that PERT allows her to lead a nearly normal life.</p>
<p>I attended an event run by the National Disability Charity Sense, which supports people with complex disabilities to be understood, connected and valued. Sense supports children, young people and adults in their home, in the community, and campaigns passionately for the rights of the people it represents. Sense is calling for disabled people to be put at the heart of the Covid-19 inquiry. I spoke with Emma Blackmore, who was born with congenital rubella syndrome which affects her vision and hearing, who told me of her experiences of the pandemic, including increased loneliness and anxiety. Sense research shows that nearly three quarters of disabled people believe that their needs have been ignored and have not received enough support during the pandemic. Nearly two thirds said their mental health had worsened and they feel less optimistic about their future. Since 1992, the United Nations International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) has been observed worldwide annually on 3rd of December.</p>
<p>The Petitions Committee held its weekly planning meeting, and I have been scheduled to present Reggie’s Law on behalf of the Petitions Committee and petitioners <span dir="ltr">on Monday 13th December</span>. Reggie’s Law petition asks the UK Government to introduce regulation of all websites where animals are being sold, including verifying the identity of all sellers, and for pictures to be displayed of the animals being sold with the animal’s parents. The petition was started by Richard Ackers who started “Justice for Reggie” after his puppy Reggie fell ill in a matter of hours after taking him home and died from Parvovirus. Richard bought Reggie from an online seller who claimed to be reputable, but it turned out to be a puppy farm.</p>
<p>The officers of the APPG for the Environment, of which I’m a vice-chair met to discuss a work plan for the next few months. The aim of the APPG is to promote environmental ambition across Parliament in the three core areas: climate and energy, focusing on the UK’s presidency of COP 26 leading up to COP 27 in China in November 2022; natural environment, focusing on nature-based solutions to climate change; and waste and resources, focusing on UK recycling rates, and improving resource efficiency.</p>
<p>I joined a virtual meeting of the Motor Neurone Disease APPG to discuss UK Government funding for MND research and to listen to our guest speakers: Professor Ammar Al-Chalabi, Professor of Neurology and Complex Disease Genetics at Kings College, London who spoke about the impact that targeted funding for MND research will have in the search for effective treatments and a cure; Thos Cochrane, Senior Medical Director at Biogen, who spoke about the future of MND research in the UK in collaboration with patients, researchers, and clinicians; and Nicola Waters who gave us a personal perspective of living with MND.</p>
<p>The APPG for Steel met virtually to receive an update from UK Steel about the increasing costs of wholesale energy prices in the UK, and the consequences for steel production. And the continued delay to a UK/US deal to lift Section 232 tariffs. In October wholesale electricity prices peaked at 40 times the 2020 average, whilst the UK monthly average was 50% more than German averages. In November UK prices are 25% higher than average. These prices lead to smaller or wiped out profits and to less reinvestment, and some companies have paused production. Increased UK electricity prices are a disincentive for international steel companies to invest in the UK. Furthermore, considerably higher electricity prices affect steel production decarbonisation because it requires up to 300% more electricity consumption. UK Steel believe that the UK Government could help by acting immediately to introduce protection against volatile wholesale prices, such as a regulated wholesale price, as in France and Italy. And for a total cost of £50m/pa: provide 100% instead of 75% compensation for Carbon costs in electricity bills; provide 85% compensation for Capacity Market Fee, and an 85% reduction in network costs in line with France and Germany; and full exemptions for the renewable levies or introduce additional compensation.</p>
<p>UK Steel has called for the UK and US Governments to work together to find an immediate resolution to Section 232 tariffs. <span dir="ltr">On 1st January</span>, steelmakers in the EU will gain a significant price advantage over their UK counterparts, having negotiated tariff free steel exports from the EU to the US. Since the tariffs were imposed on the EU by Trump in 2018, 25% on steel products and 10% on aluminium, UK steel exports to the US have nearly halved. The US ended tariffs from EU steel in the autumn, but the tariffs still apply to UK steel because we are out of the EU.</p>
<p>The Petitions Committee held our <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/event/6479/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/">last evidence session</a> as part of the Committee’s inquiry into Tackling Online Abuse, with UK Government Minister Chris Philp, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at DCMS, the Minister responsible for the Online Safety Bill. And Orla MacRae, the Deputy Director for Online Harms Regulation at DCMS. The Minister gave evidence to the Joint Committee on the draft Online Safety Bill in early November and signalled that Ofcom would have a strong role in holding platforms to account on their terms and conditions, and exposing what those platforms are doing that causes harm. He stated that the UK Government was minded to accept the Law Commission’s proposed reforms to online communication offences, and are looking at ways that the UK Government may go further in allowing people to choose whether or not they can see anonymous accounts. The members of the Committee asked questions to encourage the UK Government to: consider to reflect on the concerns of petitioners and others affected by online abuse in the new regulatory framework it is establishing; how the UK Government intends to measure the impact and success of its new regulation; and ask how the proposals may be amended or strengthened, as suggested by previous expert witnesses who gave evidence to our inquiry.</p>
<p>The APPGs for Football, Women’s Football and Football Fans held a joint meeting to hear from former UK Government Sports Minister Tracey Crouch MP about her recently published “Fan Led Review of Football Governance” report. The wide ranging review was promised by the UK Government as part of its 2019 General Election Manifesto. The review heard more than 100 hours of evidence from supporters from over 130 clubs over six months, and its report made 47 recommendations, 10 of which were key. The report has called for a “transfer stamp duty” of 10% on Premier League transfers to be distributed further down the football pyramid. The “solidarity levy”, which would have generated £160 million per year over the last five years, is likely to be resisted by Premier League Clubs who already pay a 4% levy to player development and a pension fund, and there is a proposal for an additional 6% levy from FIFA. Tracey said that she doesn’t feel that it’s all that radical when in the post Covid transfer window, where no fans have been in stadiums for over a year, there was still a billion pound transfer window, so there is not complete poverty. The review calls for some of this money to be distributed to grassroots and clubs, because the Premier League, already through distribution of its broadcast rights put a lot of money into the Football Foundation. This is about the Premier League clubs’ contribution and she’s sure they can afford it. Tracey said that some Premier League Clubs have said that they already contribute into academies and play-as-pension schemes, but she believes that’s a self interest. Tracey is confident that the failed European Super League and the Saudi-backed takeover of Newcastle have convinced top-flight clubs to support her recommendation for an Independent Regulator for English Football (IREF) which would run a licensing system for professional clubs, and with supporters’ backing, block an attempt at a future breakaway competition. The IREF would be established by Parliament and it is hoped to be in place by the start of the 2023-24 season. The IREF would demand clubs to show proof of sustainability and have sweeping powers to intervene if poorly run. The report also recommended a new mandatory code of corporate governance for all professional clubs and mandatory “equality, diversity and inclusion plans”. Plus the introduction of a Shadow Board of fans to deal with clubs and supporters which would have a veto or “golden share” against things like changing the name of their club. The report also recommended a separate review for women’s football, and improved protection for players who leave the professional game. Tracey wants investment into kids football to prevent children who are the future of the game having to play on grotty grass pitches on a Saturday and <span dir="ltr">Sunday morning</span>.</p>
<p>Great news that our Co-operative Party and USDAW #NotPartOfTheJob campaign to end violence against retail workers looks like it may have succeeded. Research by USDAW found that 9 out of 10 shop workers faced abuse in the last year, and many have been threatened, and faced violence. Alex Norris Labour and Co-operative MP introduced his Assaults on Retail Workers (Offences) Private Members’ Bill (PMB) in March 2020 asking that certain offences of violence, such as malicious wounding, grievous or actual bodily harm, and common assault against shop floor staff, should be considered “aggravated” offences. The UK Government did not support Alex’s PMB, but after years of campaigning by USDAW and the Co-operative Party, the UK Government announced on 2nd December, that assaulting public-facing workers like shop workers will become a specific “aggravated” offence, and the UK Government will seek to amend the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in the House of Lords. However, USDAW and the Co-operative Party, will be carefully studying the words of the amendment to make sure that it delivers the protection that shop workers deserve.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to join the NPTCVS AGM virtual meeting and learn about the wonderful work of our local council for voluntary service. The meeting was supported by over 100 members on the call. The Chairman, David Davies JP, welcomed us and provided an introduction to the meeting. The Director, Gaynor Richards MBE, presented the annual report, followed by the keynote address from Karen Jones, Chief Executive of NPTCBC. The vote of thanks was given by Dr Edward Roberts, Vice-Chairman of NPTCVS. I look forward to continuing to work with Gaynor and her tremendous team of staff and volunteers.</p>
<p>My friend and colleague Kevin Brennan MP introduced the Second Reading of his Private Members Bill “Copyright (Rights and Remuneration of Musicians, Etc.)” which has cross party support. Kevin is an accomplished singer/songwriter and formed the group MP4 with three other MPs many years ago. One of the reasons that he formed the group was to support the music industry in its efforts to protect, extend and enforce copyright and to develop new technologies to allow for safe, legal and monetised consumption of music so that rights holders and creators could be paid. Then the new technology came along with legal downloading, followed by streaming on services such as Spotify and Apple Music, which makes up more than 70% of UK recorded music revenues, generating hundreds of millions of new revenue for the UK music industry. Kevin’s Bill seeks to bring into law measures proposed by a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee report published earlier this year, entitled “Economics of Music Streaming”. The Bill extends the existing Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988to modernise the law for the new world of music streaming, and would provide performers on a recording with a right to an unwaivable payment or equitable remuneration when their music is streamed, akin to the existing right in radio and broadcast. It would not take away the right of labels to value their exclusive rights, which would remain intact. Nor would it dictate what the remuneration should be which is best settled by the parties, but it would make it clear that the payment is an additional payment and could be referred to the existing copyright tribunal where there is a difference of opinion. Unfortunately, despite cross party support, the UK Government did not support Kevin’s Bill, and it did not make progress.</p>
<p>The next Private Members Bill on the Order Paper was Chris Bryant’s “Acquired Brain Injury” Bill, which forced the UK Government to develop, publish and review a cross-departmental strategy on ABI. Chris has been campaigning, through his APPG for ABI, of which I am a vice-chair, for many years for victims of ABI whether occurring through accidents, sporting injuries, or other means, to receive recognition and be supported to improve their quality of life. This week the UK Government made a written statement in the Commons and Lords that they would be creating a Panel Board in the new year with officials from many departments to start developing a whole-Government strategy on ABI, co-chaired by Chris and UK Government Minister Gillian Keegan. In view of this remarkable achievement, Chris made a short statement to the House stating that he would not be moving his Bill.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, it was good to catch up with my dear friend Brian Warlow, of Neath Market Health Store, who amongst many other things, is the main volunteer and marshall at the Gnoll Park Run. After the run, we planted some trees at Brynau farm, which is on the hill overlooking Gnoll Park. As part of #NationalTreeWeek, Woodland Trust Cymru, whose aim is to plant and restore nature woods and trees to combat climate change and to build a greener future to help the #BigClimateFightback, organised for schools and individuals to take part in this great event. It was a pleasure to meet the National Trust, and Woodland Trust Cymru staff and volunteers, and the many individuals and families who were enjoying the great weather and superb views from Brynau farm whilst planting trees which in a few years will grow into a beautiful wood.</p>

<p>Fuel poverty is everywhere in our community; it hits those who work and those who are unable to; it hits people with disabilities especially hard and has a hugely detrimental effect on affected children.</p>
<p>I recently chaired a cross-party inquiry looking into the impact of fuel poverty on people living with a terminal illness. It was devastating to hear just how many people living with terminal illnesses spend their last days in fuel poverty. No family should have to endure the worry of heating a home while caring for a sick relative, never mind one with whom they are spending their last moments. Everyone deserves dignity while dying.</p>
<p>Fuel poverty is always a huge concern here in the Highlands, especially throughout winter. Households already pay more for electricity because of unfair geographical surcharges; add that we have a higher proportion of households off the grid, the surge in energy prices, rising food costs, tory cuts to Universal Credit, and we have a perfect winter storm of misery ahead for many people in our community.</p>
<p>Last week I visited some local charities and food banks, who are doing fantastic work supporting people who need a helping hand. Several of them report that more people than ever before are requesting cold food parcels because they cannot afford to cook food.</p>
<p>Imagine how cold their home will be this winter if they cannot afford to even heat their food.</p>
<p>To make the impact needed to tackle fuel poverty, the UK Government needs to end its attack on the poorest in our society. The UK already has the highest poverty levels in Western Europe, and this tory Government seems intent on widening the gap even further. Their choices do not reflect the values of our society, and with the powers to make these decisions in Scotland, we will have the opportunity to make different choices.</p>
<p>Here in the Highlands, we are in a preposterous situation where we generate the electricity, pay more to transmit it, and get it back. I’ve raised this issue with the UK Government Ministers countless times – they know the problem – they just choose not to act.</p>
<p>This will be an exceptionally tough winter for many hard-pressed families, and if you or anyone you know is struggling, there is help out there. Reach out to local charities or get in touch with my office &#8211; my team and I are here to help.</p>

<p>MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar Angus MacNeil is to meet with the Hebridean Housing Partnership (HHP) in the coming weeks regarding concerns over housing on the islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: &nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;At the recent Western Isles Fishermen’s AGM concerns were raised about the lack of housing in Leverburgh. Following that meeting I wrote to HHP raising the need for greater accessibility to housing in Leverburgh and in other areas and was delighted to learn from HHP that they are indeed conducting a feasibility study in Leverburgh.</p>



<p>“HHP tell me that they are currently researching and will reporting on the housing needs in Leverburgh with a view to building. I hope that they do go ahead and build in Leverburgh but I understand that they have to go through their procedures.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is right that HHP do their processes of diligence, but it is also right that voices in the community that probably instinctively know what is required, are given due weight as well. I am amplifying these voices and calling for houses to be built in Leverburgh to meet the needs of the community, businesses and all.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach. But we also
need to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats, and to mobilise
finance, particularly for communities at the greatest threat from the effects
of climate change.”<br>
<br>
Cllr Sally Longford will be attending COP26 this week as part of the Core
Cities delegation, to showcase Nottingham’s response to the climate emergency
and learn from cities around the world about what more we can do. </p>



<p>Cllr
Longford also updated Full Council on significant progress in Nottingham toward
its 2028 carbon neutral goal:</p>



<ul><li>City CO2
emissions have reduced by 53% per capita since 2005, the most of any UK core
city and</li><li>45% of the
Council fleet is now ULEV. </li><li>First in world to
use purpose built electric bin wagons and over </li><li>14,500 trees have
been planted since 2019 with 50,000 by 2023. </li><li>130 public EV
charging points, with an additional </li><li>81 recently
installed at new Broadmarsh Car Park.</li><li>Since 2012, over
7,000 social and private hard-to-heat homes have been insulated and over 4,000
social housing properties now have solar panels.</li></ul>



<p>“However I am far from
complacent, there is much to do and we cannot do this on our own.” insisted
Cllr Sally Longford.<br>
<br>
“We need Government, private investment and other stakeholders to support our
vital work. We have already had demonstrator projects in the city, but they
need to be scaled up, creating jobs and achieving a just transition to a low
carbon economy, where our more deprived communities can benefit from warmer
homes, affordable energy and access to clean modes of transport.”</p>



<p>Last Saturday worldwide
marches took place to demand international action on climate change. Cllr
Longford attended, and spoke at, the event.</p>



<p>“I was honoured to be given
the opportunity to lead the march alongside Lilian Greenwood, with a diverse
group of people, on Saturday to stand up for Climate Justice and to speak at
the rally in the Old Market Square.”</p>



<p>Councillor Longford wrapped
up her answer by stating “We need the Government to take action, and truly
commit to a net zero-carbon future.” </p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

              <h3>Emma Lewell-Buck (South Shields)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last week, I lead an important debate in Parliament on sewage pollution in Whitburn, an issue that many people in our town are rightly concerned about.</p>



<p>South Shields, like many other coastal towns across the country, takes pride in ensuring our beaches demonstrate the highest environmental standards to make it a place for everyone to enjoy. Yet raw sewage dumping at the Whitburn end of Seaburn beach and into the North Sea has caused problems for decades.</p>



<p>I thought it was important to remind the Government that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2012 that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations and breached standards for treating wastewater in relation to the sewage dumping at this location. And that in 2020, the European Court of Justice found again that the levels of sewage dumping at Whitburn continued to breach standards.</p>



<p>As the sewage flows, our gorgeous beach is continually damaged. The wildlife and sea life that once inhabited our rock pools is disappearing. Dolphins and seals, regulars on our coastline, now swim through sewage soup and the seagrass meadows in the nearby River Tyne estuary are being ruined. This is wholly unacceptable.</p>



<p>In the nine years that I have been the MP for South Shields and part of this campaign alongside constituent Mr Latimer and the Whitburn Residents Forum, I have seen us stonewalled by various Departments, bodies, companies, Secretaries of State and Ministers who claim this sewage dumping is a figment of our imagination. It is not. We know that, because we live there.</p>



<p>Sewage has rightly been the topic of conversation in recent weeks after the Governments shameful behaviour voting down an amendment from the Lords on the Environment Bill that would have legally required water companies to take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows.</p>



<p>The Government has subsequently U-turned over the sewage amendment after fierce backlash from Labour MP’s, campaigners and the public, however, it is a disingenuous attempt to appease the public. If the Government really did care about sewage dumping, why have they sat back while knowing that Whitburn is continually being blighted.</p>



<p>I concluded my opening speech by pleading with the Minister Rebecca Pow to do once and for all what her predecessors have refused to, and outline what steps she is going to take to clean up our beach. The Minister came to the debate unprepared and failed to answer my questions but did subsequently agreed to meet with me.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps visits Arla distribution centre, where 1/10 of all milk sold in the UK travels through.</strong></p>
<p>It was a chilly constituency Friday for Mr Shapps, as he was invited to tour the 235,000 square foot refrigerated distribution facility, which sees 520 million litres of fresh milk pass through it each year.</p>
<p>Opened in 2013, the facility operates 24/7, 364 days a year, delivering brands such as Cravendale to stores around the country, to retailers like Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s. The centre employs a team of 500 people, 60% of which are Welwyn Hatfield residents.</p>
<p>Prior to the tour of the distribution centre, Mr Shapps sat down with Ash Amirahmadi- Managing Director of Arla Foods UK- and other members of the local team to discuss the challenges and pressures facing the company, and food distribution more widely, during the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>At the centre of discussions was the HGV driver shortage. At Arla, HGV salaries have been going up to meet demand for drivers- with annual salaries of £50,000-£70,000 depending on shift pattern.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of Arla Foods said: “We were delighted to welcome Grant Shapps to Arla Hatfield. We had a very constructive and positive discussion about our cooperative and the wider dairy sector with him, both as our local MP and as the Transport Secretary. We look forward to continuing to work closely together in the future.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s been really great to come to Arla, and hear first hand how businesses with a presence in my own constituency have been reacting to the international HGV driver shortage, as well as how the company has adapted to doing business post-covid.</p>
<p>“I commend Arla for their commitment to improving pay and conditions for HGV drivers. Increases in pay, starting a driving academy to train new drivers, as well as a programme to rehabilitate former prisoners to drive lorries and improvements to their facilities- all of these things will help make driving an HGV a more attractive career choice for those looking to get into the industry. Our plan seems to be working, with 1,000 provisional HGV licenses being applied for each day- that’s 3 times higher than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As Transport Secretary, I’ve put together a list of 25 separate measures to help ease the pressure on businesses like Arla- including increasing driving test capacity at the DVSA to clear the covid backlog, making those tests faster by stream-lining them and getting the army in to take on some of the strain in the short-term.</p>
<p>“These measures, combined with the hard work of the food distributors I’ve met today, will keep our supplies stocked as the global economy gets back up and running.”</p></div>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

              <h3>Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
