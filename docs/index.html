<p>       The EU intends to improve its offer to the world for  its progress to net zero.It plans a 55% reduction in output of carbon dioxide compared to 1990 levels which will require tough action to cut fossil fuel use in transport, homes and industry. </p>
<p>        It has led to various disputes. Should the lower income countries be allowed laxer targets than the richer ones, who arguably are better able to pay for a fast transition? Will there be substantial solidarity funds to help pay the costs of change from EU funds for the poorer countries?</p>
<p>           Should the EU carbon trading scheme be extended from electricity and general industry to cover personal transport and home heating? If so how high would the carbon price go, cutting the living standards of all who were hit by the new carbon penalties? Are the voters of EU states now ready to pay more directly for car and boiler use, on top of the extra indirect costs already imposed through electricity and general industrial product prices?</p>
<p>           German opinion is getting more and more concerned about the possible expansion of a transfer Union, where Germany will  be expected to pay more to help countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. It is also worried about the extent of ECB buy up of the bonds of the weaker countries of the Union to keep interest costs down. The next ECB meeting and the next EU Council in June are going to be important meetings about far the EU plans to go down the road of fuller financial integration, binding Germany in to accept more the debts and obligations of poorer countries and more of  the high costs of the road to net zero. Germany is also unwilling to phase out its coal industry and coal power stations this decade. </p>

<p><strong>Re: Award of Elite Academy licenses for 2022-2027</strong></p>



<p>I am concerned at the recent announcement from the Rugby Football League (RFL) on the award of Elite Academy licences for 2022-27.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The approach taken and the outcome would appear to represent a reduction in opportunity in the community heartlands of the sport and a concentration predominantly in the hands of leading Super League clubs.&nbsp;It has also thrown up some worrying outcomes&nbsp;and raises a number of questions about its objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chair of the decision making panel, Air Commodore Dean Andrew OBE stated afterwards that: “We did not work to award a set number of licences”. This is clearly not the case and&nbsp;is at&nbsp;odds with the RFL statement&nbsp;that there was “an agreement that a maximum of 12 licences should be awarded – up to nine in ‘Core Affinity Areas’, up to two in ‘Emerging Affinity Areas’, and up to one in France.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is this&nbsp;latter part&nbsp;gives rise to concerns that this was about quotas rather than an assessment of record, performance and potential and that crucially, deep roots into the community game may have had little weight in the consideration. I find it worrying that such links to the grass roots of the sport appear&nbsp;to&nbsp;have been set aside.&nbsp; It is, after all, the affinity of our communities for the sport and the part it plays in the life of towns and cities across the north that is the beating heart of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;disconnect&nbsp;appears most starkly illustrated by the&nbsp;decision not to award an Elite Academy licence to Bradford Bulls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bulls Academy has been&nbsp;productive and respected&nbsp;for its work, a rich source of playing talent. Leon Pryce, Sam Burgess, and John Bateman to name but a few of the players to have come through the academy and gone onto star at the highest levels of our sport.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bradford Bulls is a rooted in the communities of Bradford, the people and the fans. The club sits at the apex of a vibrant local community rugby league structure, particularly in South Bradford. It acts as a powerful incentive and objective for young local players starting out in the sport.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RFL’s decision endangers those deep social roots in an area with a huge affinity for the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also find it concerning that the club indicate that they have not had an explanation of the reasons that their application was unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would appreciate a clear explanation and rationale for the approach taken for developing the&nbsp;Elite&nbsp;Academy&nbsp;model, how this fits with developing players from the community game, and why Bradford’s well established and productive academy program was unsuccessful in that context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for your consideration of these matters. I look forward to your reply.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Philip Dunne MP is encouraging women across South Shropshire to share their experiences through the Government’s consultation to reshape the future of women’s healthcare.</p>

<p>The first of its kind, the Women’s Health Strategy will address women’s health in England over the course of their lifetimes from adolescence through to older age. It will focus on health issues specific to women as well as the ways in which women experience health issues.</p>

<p>First launched in March, over 75,000 women, organisations, clinicians and carers have responded to the call for evidence so far. However, responses from the West Midlands make up just 8 per cent of the total responses.</p>

<p>To enable as many women as possible to have their say and capture a variety of views on access to services, experiences and health outcomes, the call for evidence will be now extended by 2 weeks, to close on 13th June.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne said:</p>

<p>“As a former Health Minister, I am acutely aware that there is work to do in improving women’s health care, as well as improving women’s experience of treatment within the NHS.</p>

<p>“As we look towards our recovery and building our NHS back better, we must seize this moment to deliver a system that truly delivers for women, and we want them to have their say in shaping the future of women’s healthcare.</p>

<p>“I would encourage women across South Shropshire to share their experiences, so together we can deliver fairer, more equal and better healthcare for everyone in this country”.</p>

<p>Commenting, Minister for Women’s Health Nadine Dorries said:</p>

<p>“For generations, women have been living in a health and care system primarily designed by men, for men.</p>

<p>“The number of responses to date has been incredible and I thank everyone who has shared their experiences – these interim findings clearly highlight the need for decisive action.</p>

<p>“I now urge every woman in the West Midlands if they have not yet, to come forward and respond to the call for evidence. It is only by hearing the experiences and priorities of women from all walks of life that we can truly develop a strategy that works for all women.”</p>

<p>The Daily Mail have launched a campaign highlighting the problem of private equity firms&nbsp;buying up care homes.</p>
<p>When Southern Cross collapsed in 2011 there were thousands of residents living in their care homes facing distress and anxiety. They were left in the dark about whether they would be able to remain in their home. We cannot let this happen again.</p>
<p>The consequences of getting this wrong are appalling. It affects on frail care home residents, their families, and the taxpayer. The Government should leave no stone unturned in making sure we have a care system fit for the future.</p>

I’ve been thinking a lot about our local environment. I recently found out that here in Stockport, we have a staggering 1.3 million trees – which equates to roughly 12% of the Greater Manchester tree population. I believe passionately that these trees ought to be protected, and planting should be a key focus of Stockport Council. That’s why I was so pleased to see the council commit to adding an orchard in every ward across the borough by 2026 and initiate an unprecedented tree planting programme.</p>
<p>Yet our environment is defined by more than our wonderful trees and plants, it is also defined by our relationship with it. How we travel, build, and interact with our neighbours affects the environment we live in.</p>
<p>Take for example the traffic issues around Manchester Road and the surrounding side streets. Rat running and traffic problems at key junctions have not only given residents a headache but created an environment that is both unsafe and unsustainable.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m very happy with the work that is currently being done by councillors both in Reddish South and in Heatons North to address these problems. They plan to work with the council to develop an active neighbourhoods and traffic management model. This model will be built around consultation with residents and tackle the problem with innovative local government intervention.</p>
<p>Building cleaner, greener and safer communities is about more than simply planting trees. It’s about focussing on sustainability when addressing problems and working with local communities to create an environment that is better for everyone. By doing this, I know that we can safeguard our environment and hand it on to the next generation in a better condition than we received it.</p>

<p>Graham Stuart MP, Chair of CADEY, met with CADEY committee members Nick Middleton (HEY Smile Foundation), Nicola Waudby (Humber Aid), and Warren Bostock and Jo Watson (Yorkshire Ambulance Service) to congratulate them on their hard work and inroads into covering all communities in Beverley and Holderness with publicly accessible defibrillators.</p>
<p>When CADEY was founded in March 2018, its stated aim was to boost defibrillator coverage across Beverley and Holderness. Thanks to the charitable contributions of Esh Civils, Humber Aid, Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS), Help for Health and NURSE, YAS’s list of target communities is currently down to 21, compared to the original 63 target areas. Ross Markwell of Esh Civils also attended the meeting, having funded 10 defibrillators in the East Riding, of which 7 are in Beverley &amp; Holderness.</p>
<p>Ross Markwell, Esh Civils, commented “Thank you for allowing us to be part of such a fantastic initiative. We look forward to supporting further defibrillators as we continue to work across the region.</p>
<p>“Esh provide the money, but it’s people like Nick Middleton of Smile who do the hard work of identifying sites and procuring the defibs. I am also grateful to Humber Aid for the match-funding that makes our contributions to local communities possible.”</p>
<p>This year, YAS has taught nearly 200 people through online familiarisation sessions to have the confidence to use a defib. Jo Watson from YAS will be running 3 more at 10am Saturday 5th June, 1pm Thursday 10<sup>th</sup> June, 7pm Thursday 10<sup>th</sup> June. To sign up to one of these free online sessions, go to Eventbrite and search “<strong>Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) Community Public Access Defibrillator (CPAD) Familiarisation session” to book a slot. For further information or support, contact </strong><a href="mailto:joanne.watson1@nhs.net">joanne.watson1@nhs.net</a>.</p>
<p>Moving forward, CADEY is looking to aid the ongoing development of the BHF’s The Circuit app by encouraging all privately and publicly owned defibrillators to be registered on its database. The Circuit, otherwise known as the National Defibrillator Network, is an online register which is looking to go live at the end of June.</p>
<p>Although NHS Ambulance Services already have defibrillator databases for many regions, The Circuit will connect them together to provide a single national view. YAS will be asking everyone to migrate onto The Circuit.</p>
<p>The Circuit will automate the process of reporting usage. It will prompt guardians to ensure the defib is back in its cabinet and will update the ambulance trust when this has been done.</p>
<p>It also makes registration of new defibs quicker, reminds guardians to maintain their defibrillators and allows ambulance trusts to see the nearest cross-border defibrillators.</p>
<p>Graham said, “With the new online resources, never has it been easier to access and use these life saving devices. I am confident, with the help of the BHF’s The Circuit app, we will help save precious minutes, if not seconds, in providing treatment to those suffering from a cardiac arrest.   </p>
<p>“I encourage as many people as possible to take part in the upcoming familiarisation sessions, hosted by the Yorkshire Ambulance service. These short informal online classes will provide the confidence to use a defib.</p>
<p>“There was a story in the Hull Daily Mail recently of a woman in Hedon who collapsed in the street. She was saved by a passing driver who administered CPR until the nearest defib was collected. This is what we’re talking about; a potentially tragic real-life event, which could happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere, which highlights how important it is to have the confidence to administer CPR and a defib. It can be the difference between life and death.”</p>

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP has called for improved safety for blind and partially sighted people at Weston-super-Mare and Weston Milton train stations, after discussions with Guide Dogs UK.<br><br>Weston and Milton stations, like a third of train stations in the UK, do not currently have&nbsp;tactile surfaces installed on the edge of their platforms. The bumps on these&nbsp;tactile surfaces help people with sight loss know when they are close to the platform edge.<br><br>John wrote to the Chair of Network Rail,&nbsp;Sir Peter Hendy, setting out his concerns and asking that new safety measures are introduced to both stations. Network Rail have replied promising both Weston-super-Mare and Weston Milton stations will get the safety upgrade, but without an immediate deadline for the work to be completed. &nbsp;<br><br>John said, &#8220;It’s often hard to put ourselves in the position of someone with sight loss, so it was really helpful to hear from Guide Dogs UK about this simple, practical and potentially lifesaving change that makes our train stations safer. It’s great that Network Rail has promised to upgrade our two local stations that haven’t got the tactile strips yet, but now we need a firm date for the work. At the moment they’ve only promised it will happen before 2029, which is much too far down the line. Let’s see if we can get them to speed this process up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I was therefore delighted to join this morning’s NCC MP Briefing and see Lord Dannatt present the NSFA’s own initial recommendations – many of which are an adoption of those we raised here in Mid Norfolk just a couple of months ago.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Among the first plans to be implemented are:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The establishing of a new 0344 helpline number so that people and businesses affected by flooding can call a single contact and receive advice, support and assistance from specifically trained staff.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>A leaflet campaign to properties across the county – advertising the new 0344 number and providing other useful information and contacts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Both steps were recommended by the MNFP.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Full details of the NSFA’s plans will be announced shortly and I am pleased to be working with fellow Norfolk MP colleagues to explore how we can best lead this campaign in Westminster – to highlight and hopefully address the key planning issues that so often underpin flooding matters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><b>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, criticises the Government’s decision allow billions to leave the country in unpaid tax</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has criticised the Government’s decision not to back a global minimum corporation tax on Monday. The proposed minimum corporation tax rate of 15% would have applied across the world. This multilateral agreement is intended to reduce tax avoidance by huge corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill on Monday, urging the Government to support the US proposals. Karin Smyth, voted in favour of the amendment, but the entire Conservative Party voted to reject it. The UK is now the only G7 country not to back a global minimum corporation tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals would introduce a minimum global corporation tax rate starting at 15%, and analysis by Tax Justice UK suggests that a global minimum corporation tax would generate billions a year. This could be used to inject funding into the NHS and support vital public services. </span></p>
<p><b>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is deeply disappointing that the UK is the only G7 country who has failed to support the proposals for a global corporation tax, a move that would protect British businesses and ensure billions remain in the UK economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is more important than ever that the Government prioritises job creation and economic growth. Yet the Government has failed to deliver a financial plan to help people in Bristol South back into work or to help local businesses that are struggling, and now they have rejected an amendment which could help the UK to tackle the economic challenges left in the wake of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Government’s Finance Bill has failed the people of Bristol South. It has no plan to deal with the ongoing costs from the Covid-19 pandemic and has ensured that public services are in desperate need of funding. The Chancellor’s Budget revealed that NHS England core resource spending would be reduced from £147.7 million to £139.1 million in the next year. Yet he refuses to back a plan that would secure £13.5bn a year for the Treasury.”</span></p>

John is part of the National Garden Scheme in Essex. The scheme gives visitors access to over 3500 exceptional private gardens in England and Wales. 100 of these gardens are in Essex. The scheme raises impressive amounts of money for nursing and health charities through admissions, teas, and cake. The scheme has been running for 90 years.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>John’s Exotic Garden</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">John explained he has always had a passion for horticulture and would describe himself as a “plant man”. When asking John what advice he would give to new gardeners who have potential to join the scheme he said: <em>“Just go for it! If you have a passion for gardening and enthusiasm, it could really help others and be an enjoyable experience”. </em></p><p class="MsoNormal">Although the gardens do require maintenance and dedication, John explained that this can all be done on a budget. He regularly engages in “plant swaps” with other gardeners and buys seeds to grow the plants from seedlings.</p><p class="MsoNormal">John has a number of impressive plants in his garden. Including exotic flowers, bananas, and ginger. He said his exotic garden has the ability to make individuals feel like they have been transported thousands of miles away. Fresh air, a hobby and beautiful surroundings are just some of the mental and physical benefits this scheme has to offer.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Charity begins in the garden!</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">The National Gardening Scheme is hugely successful in their endeavour to raise money for charity. This has been particularly important in the last two years, with the challenges Covid-19 has bought. The generosity of Essex garden owners, volunteers and visitors means the scheme was able to raise over £39,000 in 2020. This total is added to a national pot and distributed to Macmillan Cancer Support, Marie Curie, Hospice UK, Carer’s Trust, The Queen’s Nursing Institute, Parkinson’s UK, Perennial and Guest Charity Mind.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>How to get involved</strong></p><p>If you would like to visit John’s garden in Dagenham or get involved with the National Gardening Scheme, all information can be found on the Nation Gardening Scheme’s website at: <a href="https://essexngs.co.uk/2021-gardens-open-for-private-group-visits/">2021 gardens open for private group visits - National Garden Scheme in Essex (essexngs.co.uk)</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-2 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden clearfix"><ul class="links"><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-0"><a href="/tags/dagenham" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Dagenham</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-1"><a href="/tags/community-focus" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Community Focus</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-2"><a href="/tags/exotic-garden" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Exotic Garden</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-3"><a href="/tags/garden" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">garden</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-4"><a href="/tags/charity" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Charity</a></li></ul></div>

<p>Na h-Eileananan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has welcomed the confirmation from the Scottish Government that they are in discussions regarding the lease of an additional vessel for the Calmac fleet – but stresses that the option of a subsea tunnel should also be considered.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has written several times this year to the Scottish Government regarding the ageing Calmac fleet with repeated suggestions to charter MV Pentalina and has also suggested the construction of new vessels in Gdansk in Poland.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “I welcome that the Scottish Government is in discussions in regard to leasing an additional vessel. This is something which I have been suggesting and pressing the Scottish Government on for the last six months. I have recently heard that the Pentalina may need a not inconsiderable spend to get her into condition for even trials on the West Coast &#8211; hopefully that can be cleared up.</p>



<p>“The disruption to ferry services is having a massive impact on all aspects of island life and the economy.</p>



<p>“I welcome this step forward and hope that we will see progress very soon.</p>



<p>“It should be borne in mind that £500m used as 25% to lever in investment capital could build about 200km of Faroes-style undersea ferry replacement tunnels.</p>



<p>“Transport Scotland and the Minister should seriously look into this and at the very least speak with Faroese counterparts for learning.”</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, has shared her deep concern that the UK Government has denied support for a global corporation tax, in a vote on Monday. The Labour Party tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill, to secure support for a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%.</p>
<p>Christina Rees voted in favour of the amendment, which was voted down by the Conservative UK Government 364 to 261. The initial proposal was a rate of 21%, but negotiations saw the rate reduced to 15% in an effort to gain global support. Despite this, the Tories still voted to reject this proposal. The UK is the only G7 country who has not backed President Biden’s plans.</p>
<p>The proposal would prevent multinational corporations from being able to cross borders to exploit tax havens, and guarantee that multinational corporations pay their fair share of tax.</p>
<p><strong>Christina Rees, MP for Neath, said: </strong></p>
<p>“The UK Tory Government would benefit from following the lead of the Welsh Labour Government who have supported local businesses throughout the pandemic. The UK Conservative Party had a once in a generation opportunity to repair global tax rules, and level the playing field for small businesses by ensuring fair taxation of multinational corporations. Instead, they chose to squander this and vote down Labour’s amendment on Monday.</p>
<p>“The Finance Bill has let down the people of Neath. In March, the Chancellor’s Budget announced cuts to Universal Credit which is set to take an estimated £500 out of household budgets by the end of September, whilst introducing a ‘super deduction’, allowing mega corporations, such as Amazon, to write off its entire remaining UK tax bill.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, we have a Welsh Labour Government to support us in Neath. Following the Chancellor’s Budget announcement in March, the Welsh Labour Government declared an additional £15.2 million in funding for our communities. The UK Government needs to reconsider its financial approach, to facilitate workers and businesses to succeed across the country.”</p>

<p>This week, South Lakes MP Tim Farron chaired a national cancer summit, to launch a new report setting out how the Government should tackle the cancer backlog which has been created by the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>The "Catch Up With Cancer - The Way Ahead" report was produced by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Radiotherapy which Tim chairs.</p>
<p>The report calls on the Government to recognise the scale of the problems caused by the crisis and to deliver ring-fenced investment to improve cancer infrastructure.</p>
<p>It concluded that a minister should be appointed to take responsibility for ensuring cancer care recovers, in the same way a minister for vaccines was appointed to oversee the rollout.</p>
<p>The summit was attended by medical experts, charities, patients and over 60 MPs.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"There is an unbelievable level of frustration in the cancer community, because this frightening backlog is a preventable crisis.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"They have all the expertise needed to bust the cancer backlog. But that can only happen if ministers are willing to accept there is a crisis, deliver vital investment in cancer services and act quickly."</em>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Secretary of State for Transport and Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps today has announced a comprehensive reform of the UKs railways. The plans, outlined in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987752/gbr-williams-shapps-plan-for-rail.pdf">Williams-Shapps White Paper</a>, will see rail services managed by a single government body: Great British Rail- with private business contracted to provide key services.</p>
<p>Talking about the announcement, Mr Shapps said: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 14px;">I’m delighted to be launching our Plan For Rail- the culmination of a review into the whole of our rail network. Based on our findings, we’re driving ahead with the next exciting era in British rail travel.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have a proud history of rail travel in this country- from the first steam locomotives in County Durham to the golden age of the Flying Scotsman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our national prosperity was built on the back of the railway. But after years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication, that innovative vision has faded- to the cost of passengers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;These plans put passengers first, backed by a single, familiar brand- Great British Rail. It will fuse the innovation and capital of the private sector, with the planning and accountability of the public sector to deliver value to the whole of Great Britain- including passengers in Welwyn Hatfield.</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Under these plans, Welwyn Hatfield passengers will be able to enjoy a simpler, more modern rail service. GBR will simplify the current mass of confusing tickets with new flexible season tickets and a significant roll-out of more convenient Pay As You Go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grant Shapps also revealed the role that local innovations had in inspiring some of the proposals in the white paper:</p>
<p>&#8220;As it so happens, contactless travel beyond the London Oyster system has been provide pioneered here in Welwyn Hatfield- you can now make contactless journeys from WGC, Hatfield, Welham Green and Brookmans Park. Our area has therefore helped pioneer some of the new thinking that has led to the Rail White Paper, following this successful experiment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These plans will change rail travel for the better for the people of Hertfordshire, and the whole country. Simple, modern, accountable and with better value for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great British Railways is set to launch in 2023. A video was produced to accompany the launch, which can be viewed below.</p></div>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Britain is set to create a new public railway operator called Great British Railways (GBR) in what has been described as the biggest rail reform in twenty five years. Worcester MP Robin Walker has welcomed the move, arguing it has the potential to provide much-needed improvements for his constituents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Numerous companies have been charged with providing rail services around Britain following the privatisation of British Rail from 1994-1997. Since then passengers have noted confusion about booking and fares, a lack of accountability for poor service, and a spiralling costs. In Robin’s long campaign to upgrade Worcester’s rail services to both London and Birmingham and to get the new Parkway Station for the County, he has had to conduct multiple different meetings with different rail companies, Network Rail and the DFT. The new set up should allow for better accountability to local councils, MPs and regional mayors and the Transport secretary has promised a greater say for towns and cities in the way that Railways work. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Transport Secretary Grant Shapps made clear that the introduction of GBR won’t see a return to the bad old days of British Rail. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The first change passengers will notice will be flexible season tickets from June which will cater to the significant change in working patterns as a result of the pandemic, including many people now working from home more regularly. The flexible season tickets will offer travel on eight days in a 28-day period. The government also said it would eradicate uncomfortable &#8220;ironing-board seating&#8221;, and make efforts to ensure fewer repetitious and annoying pre-recorded announcements on services.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In the longer term passengers will note a more modern look and feel to the rail network, with train travel becoming cleaner and greener for both freight and commuter travel. It is hoped that GBR will also provide a single organisation that passengers can complain to in the event of problems and failures in the provision of service can hold train operators to account. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Since he was first elected in 2010 Robin has pressed for more regular services on both the London and Birmingham routes from Worcester and prior to the pandemic he had welcomed improvements to the regularity and journey times on the Cotswold line as well as additional carriages and capacity on the WMR services to Birmingham. The opening of Worcestershire Parkway Station last year was a major breakthrough after years of campaigning by Worcestershire County Council and local MPs but its full potential has yet to be realised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Worcester MP, Robin Walker, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“This week’s announcement is a very welcome change which should simplify the maze of organisations who are accountable for rail travel in Britain. It will also provide a further chance for the government to level up opportunities for communities like mine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“I will continue pushing hard to ensure the promise of listening to, and empowering towns and cities like Worcester. We need to ensure that the creation of regional organisations doesn’t mean places like Worcester being neglected in favour of nearby big cities. I know that my Rt. Honourable Friend the Transport Secretary, with a Worcestershire MP on his team in Rachel McLean has the experience, ambition and drive to deliver this aim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“As we continue to grow our local economy the case for a two hour journey from Worcester to London, and more frequent services to and from the capital, is growing and in GBT we will hopefully an organisation able to listen to the arguments and with the clout to deliver on this.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Under the reforms, GBR will own and maintain rail infrastructure and collect and set fares. It will contract private companies to run services under its banner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps said in a letter to MPs:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">‘To bring about change on the scale that is needed we will create a new body, Great British Railways, to integrate the railways for the first time in a quarter of a century, owning the infrastructure, collecting most fare revenue, running and planning the network and setting timetables. It will be a single, familiar brand responsible for delivering better value fares, punctual and reliable services and which ends the confusion of the current system.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">‘As we build back better from coronavirus we have the chance to do things differently in this country. We are a Government which profoundly believes in the future of the railway and Great British Railways will help to secure its recovery. By ending the fragmentation, increasing accountability, making journeys easier and more comfortable, and by putting passengers first we can ensure that the system thrives for decades to come, and of course, that the trains really do run on time.’</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Last week’s exposé by the BBC journalist Alex Homer on the deaths of over 150 social security claimants, mostly since 2010 and often under desperate circumstances, shocked many. Anyone listening to Philippa Day, 27, sobbing on the phone and pleading for help after her Personal Independence Payment (Pip) had been stopped, leaving her £5,000 in debt, would have been moved.</p>
<p>Philippa, a diabetic, died after taking an overdose of insulin in 2019. The coroner found that the government had failed her and issued a Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) report to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and to the company who had assessed her as not needing Pip support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe that these deaths are probably just the tip of the iceberg. As the National Audit Office’s February 2020 report into the suicides of claimants revealed: “It is highly unlikely that the 69 cases the department [for Work and Pensions] has investigated represents the number of cases it could have investigated in the past six years.”</p>
<p>And yet the government just carries on, tweaking the internal arrangements within the DWP where the deaths of some claimants are examined, “to learn the lessons”, as they say. But are they? I have been campaigning for over three years for an independent public inquiry into the deaths of vulnerable claimants because there is no evidence that the government is learning.</p>
<p>The death of David Clapson, a diabetic, in 2013, after he had been sanctioned and had no money for electricity to keep his insulin cold; the suicide of Fazia Ahmed in 2014, when the coroner issued a PFD report saying that failings in the DWP had contributed to her death; the suicide of Jodey Whiting in 2017 after she was found fit for work and her social security support was stopped despite her being housebound; the death from multiple organ failure of Stephen Smith in 2018 who weighed 6st after his social security support was stopped; and of Errol Graham, who had severe mental illness, who was only 4st 7lb when he died the same year.</p>
<p>Five PFDs have been issued since 2010; it would have been six but the government promised to improve its safeguarding policy in 2019, which we are still waiting for. These are only a handful of the cases, and the government has done nothing to identify the scale of the issue.</p>
<p>For example, exactly how many vulnerable claimants such as Philippa have died after their PIP was stopped? In an answer to a written question in 2019 by Madeleine Moon, the former MP for Bridgend, figures suggested that over 130 working age people a month were dying soon after being found ineligible for PIP by the government contractors Atos and Capita. Other data is more vague.</p>
<p>And what is driving these deaths? If the government is so concerned with stopping these deaths, why did it dismiss the recommendations from the cross-party work and pensions committee’s recent report on universal credit and the five-week wait for financial support, when we highlighted the ad hoc way vulnerable claimants were being identified by work coaches and the risks this posed?</p>
<p>As a constituency MP, I have had a number of cases where it was abundantly clear that there had been flaws in the health assessments conducted either for PIP or Employment Support Allowance. I have also seen people being sanctioned — when social security support could stop for up to two years — for no reason.</p>
<p>There is also mounting evidence of the impact on claimants’ mental health of what has been described as a dehumanising culture in the DWP and the swingeing cuts in support to working age claimants — over £33 billion since 2010. As a former public health consultant, I think it is reasonable to say that the debt and poverty that claimants are facing will also contribute to their poor health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The publicity around Philippa and other people’s deaths was a watershed moment. Family members of other claimants who had died contacted me from all over the country and asked me to add their names to the list; they thought the deaths of their fathers, mothers, sisters, bothers, sons or daughters were isolated cases. Sadly, they are not.</p>
<p>The government can no longer be allowed to mark their own homework. There must be an independent public inquiry to understand the true scale and causes behind these deaths. Otherwise there will be more relatives left without their loved ones.</p>

<h1>Dear Newcastle</h1>
<p>It is hard to believe that we have spent over a year now in various forms of lockdown with so much loss of life and so much sacrifice by so many. We hope that there is a sustainable path out of the Covid restrictions and that we can build back a fairer, better society.  A big part of this is the vaccine rollout, which continued to be successful in the North East with  great co-ordination between the NHS, Public Health professionals and volunteers. Our infection rates have reduced to around 40 per 100,000 but this is still the highest amongst the seven local authorities and twice the UK average. However it is positive that despite easing of certain restrictions we have not seen any spike in infections.</p>
<p>But part of building back better is investment in local communities and businesses and we are yet to see a plan from this Government that does that.</p>

<p>In Newcastle it was good to see non essential shops opening in a covid secure way. So many local businesses have suffered during lockdown, it is important to support them as much as possible. I want to thank everyone who has followed the rules during this difficult time and I hope everyone can look forward to a better spring and summer.</p>
<p>In Parliament my work focused on  two of the Bills I am leading on for Labour – the National Security and Investment Bill and the Advanced Research and Innovation Bill – as well as continuing to highlight the impact of the pandemic, and Brexit, on the region.</p>

<h1>Backbench and Constituency Role</h1>
<ul>
<li>It was great to be able to be able to have some face to face meetings, in accordance with Covid restrictions, to hear direct from constituents what their concerns were!</li>
<li>The Government’s Race Report was published, refusing to recognise institutional racism. I heard from many constituents concerned about the report and worked with colleagues and comrades to co-ordinate a response.</li>
<li>I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding issues and demands for support for constituents and businesses as we follow the roadmap out of lockdown, the Horizon scandal and the need for a government inquiry, the life cycle of electric vehicles, medical care for veterans and identity theft. I have contacted numerous members of the Cabinet with questions that arose as a result of the student open meeting I hosted.</li>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>In the Queens Speech there was a noticeable absence of plans for adult social care, despite the Prime Minister saying as he entered Downing Street in 2019 “we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and despite promises of a White Paper since 2017. People in Nottingham and the rest of the country desperately need a social care system that is adequately funded over the long term and  free at the point of use. Everyone contributes, everyone’s covered – just like our NHS. Local councils like ours will still need to lead in this area as we are best placed to support people to be independent and live the lives they want to, given the range of ways that our wider work and partnerships touch everyone’s lives. </p>



<p>The pandemic has shown how important social care is for people and though social care workers do an amazing job, the growing demand alongside chronic underfunding is pushing the sector further into crisis. In March I wrote to the Government along with local Labour MPs highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care, quoting the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) who said that £1,3 billion is needed to cover demographic and inflationary pressures in 2021, Cllr Williams has  yet to receive a reply.<br> <br>Social care workers in our city support people to live well, maximising independence, choice and control. But they and the people they support, alongside their unpaid carers need a national  long term plan for social care that recognises that this is skilled  and vital work to support adults  of all ages to make their own choices, and the best of their lives at every stage. </p>



<p>The Government’s current approach has been the adult social care precept, hitting Nottingham’s hard pressed council tax payers. This precept represents a significant sum to local households, but makes a negligible impact on the pressures to the Council’s budget in this area. An inadequate sticking plaster that costs Nottingham tax payers dearly – hitting household incomes at a time of economic crisis. <br> <br>In March I wrote to the Government highlighting the need for a fair and adequate funding system for social care that covers everyone. I have yet to receive a reply. The absence of any plans in the Queen’s Speech  makes clear that  Government is going to leave those supported by adult social care, those who are paid to care, and unpaid carers left without a long term solution to the issues they experience every day. </p>



<p>In Wales and Scotland their Government’s are rising to the
challenges with commitments to paying care workers a real living wage and
considering a “National Care Service”. </p>



<p>This is a real failure to grasp the reality and urgency
&nbsp;of the problem. </p>



<p>We urge the government to listen to the nation. Just as we
have raised our voices when needed to defend our NHS, when we clapped for
carers, we meant it. They would do well to listen –
and act. </p>

I listened very carefully to the Gracious Speech, and I made the assumption that the promise to address the legacy of the past with regard to Northern Ireland refers to a Government commitment to protect veterans from vexatious and repeated prosecutions. That assurance was solidified when I looked…

<p>In the West Midlands, only 79% of people have a passport. That’s 1,149,137 who would no longer be able to vote. This number drops even further, to 75%, when talking about the number of voters with a driver's licence.  </p>
<p>These new measures which the Government wish to introduce will politically silence more than a fifth of people in the West Midlands and is a dangerous precedent to set against our democratic rights.  </p>
<p>The Conservative Government are looking to put this in place, at a cost of around £20 million per election in a bid to prevent voter fraud. While preventing voter impersonation is a laudable goal, it is a costly and unnecessary one and simply distracts people from the growing issues that are at the heart of our country. </p>
<p>At the elections in 2019, the Police found that of the 58m votes cast, just 33 related to voter impersonation. This means a £20 million cost will be enacted to address something which affect 0.000057% of all votes. Surely, there must be a more cost-effective solution which can be found for such a relatively non-existent issue? </p>
<p>Most concerningly, we do not have information on how this will affect minority groups or low-income households. There is only data available to tell us about the age, sex and region of ID holders. </p>
<p>The pandemic has shown us the stark inequalities that are rife throughout our country and are growing. While solutions to address some of these inequalities might be more complex to correct, this is straightforward. Simply, do not introduce legislation that will have a disproportionate effect on those who are already facing a huge imbalance. </p>

<p>As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.</p>



<p>We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.</p>



<p>While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Please don&#8217;t hesitate to&nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.</p>



<p><strong>Birmingham Coronavirus Update</strong></p>



<p>Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:</p>



<ul><li>Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group</li><li>Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE</li><li>The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household</li><li>Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&#8217;s handling of the pandemic</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.</p>



<p>Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>You can read the full letter <a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Support for a nurses pay rise</strong></p>



<p>Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all they&#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Celebrating St Patrick&#8217;s Day</strong></p>



<p>This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.</p>



<p>Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.</p>



<p>I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fighting to safeguard employment</strong></strong></p>



<p>Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.</p>



<p>Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.</p>



<p>Alongside help for existing business we must make sure big projects such as HS2 and the Commonwealth Games deliver jobs and long term benefits for local people.</p>



<p>You can currently apply for one of over 200 vacancies with HS2 and its partners at the following link: <a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.hs2.org.uk/careers/careers-with-our-supply-chain/jobs</a></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recently coordinated a cross party <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20">letter</a> with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.</p>



<p>As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.</p>



<p>I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.</p>



<p>The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
