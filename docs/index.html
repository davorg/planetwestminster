<p>As this challenging year draws to a close, our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have lost someone to Covid, while those of us lucky enough to be untouched by such tragedy, will hopefully be thinking of our own families with fondness and thanksgiving.</p>



<p>We owe so much to our NHS and care staff but also to all the key workers who have kept us safe, maintained food or energy supplies, kept us informed and connected, and kept our schools and other critical public services functioning.  </p>



<p>With the start of the vaccination programme, we can see light at the end of the tunnel, but this winter will still be challenging, so let’s all continue to play our part by following the rules to keep each other safe.</p>



<p>Although it will be different for everyone this year, whatever your plans are, I wish you and your family a Peaceful Christmas and a Happy and Healthy New Year.</p>



<p>Take care,</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">Hard-working volunteers with the Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company have pulled another iron from the fund-raising fire – a £9,300 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to take the project to a new level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Part of the cash will be used to create a digital guide to the history of Neath Abbey – including not only the world-famous ironworks but the impressive remains of the Cistercian monastery close by.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">And with open days, guided tours and personal presentations all off-limits while the corona virus pandemic continues, digital outreach has become an essential tool in raising awareness of the project by allowing people to visualise the ironworks at its world-beating peak – when it powered the industrial revolution of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Data will be posted on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and People’s Collection Wales, creating a virtual guided tour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">In addition, new interpretive panels at the ironworks will explain the history and function of the various structures and buildings on site.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The remainder of the money will be used to renovate an old BT telephone kiosk – which cost £1 – and convert it into a heritage centre at the nearby Longford housing estate where local people can, via a display book and works of art, discover the area’s history.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The artworks will be created by children of the local Dwr y Felin Comprehensive School. Other community groups such as Bryncoch Environment Group, Dyffryn Clydach Community Council, Dyffryn Clydach and Bryncoch Historic Group will also display community news, events and information in the kiosk.<a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2344"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2344" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8DCDF1DF-42F0-4CD0-97E0-3676E4E7186B-560x297.png" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Last week I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate entitled <strong>Future of fairs and Showgrounds</strong>. I wanted to support those showmen and women here in South Shields which has a long history of welcoming traveling showmen and women that dates back almost 100 years. It is imperative that the Government stops ignoring the fairground and showmen community and steps in to provide vital support before it is too late. As a longstanding supporter and advocate for show people and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fairs and Showgrounds, I will continue to be a voice for this community and press the Government at every opportunity for better support and recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the outset of the pandemic, many fairs were either cancelled or postponed – from summer fetes to Christmas Markets. As a result of the closures and postponing of fairs, many show people suffered huge financial loss, plunging them into financial insecurity.</p>



<p>The heart of the issue is that the financial support offered to the tourism industry during COVID-19 continually excluded the fairground community. Showmen and women also did not qualify for the assistance announced in the recent budget for retail, leisure and hospitality firms relating to business rates in the coming year, due to the way that the Show people operate, which falls outside the scope of static leisure providers.</p>



<p>Show people across the UK and particularly those here in South Shields, now face losing their businesses and livelihoods if the UK Government does not step in.</p>

As we approach an altogether different Christmas from what we are used to, I think it is important to say thank you and pay tribute to all those that have made great sacrifices to keep us safe throughout the year.</em></p><p><em>For many this has been a year of sadness and loss, loss of loved ones and a feeling that our futures have been put at risk with the economy taking such hard knocks. There will be thousands of businesses that closed their doors for good during the pandemic and a full social and economic recovery will undoubtedly be a long process.</em></p><p><em>However, there are positives to take from 2020. In this unprecedented year full of challenges and unpredictability we have also seen the very best of people. A community spirit that many thought lost in time has been rejuvenated with mutual aid and citizens alliance networks across Barking and Dagenham and Havering. Neighbours looking out for one another and protecting the most vulnerable in our society.</em></p><p><em>There are genuine signs of hope appearing as we come to the end of this difficult period. Scientists around the world have worked successfully to produce vaccines, and with a global roll out round the corner normality does not seem too far away. That is why it is all the more important that we do not give a platform to ‘Covid deniers’ or give way to the voices of anti-vaxxers.</em></p><p><em>Despite the uncertainty and subsequent economic challenges, Dagenham and Rainham has not been without success stories and is in a strong position to weather the storm. Just last month Barking and Dagenham announced their delivery partner for London’s largest film studio which will bring Hollywood investment to Dagenham East, and plans were approved earlier in the year to relocate London’s three historic markets to Dagenham Dock.</em></p><p><em>As we move into 2021, I will continue working to support local people, businesses, and voluntary organisations throughout Dagenham and Rainham. I also plan to keep the pressure on central government and will continue campaigning for greater investment in public services, improved healthcare and opportunities for our young people.</em></p><p><em>Finally, I want to extend warm wishes to families across Dagenham, Rainham, South Hornchurch and Elm Park this Christmas, and all the best for a happy and healthy new year. Whilst guidance has now changed over the holidays, I would still urge caution and encourage residents to behave in a responsible way that keeps all in our community safe.</em></p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-2 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden clearfix"><ul class="links"><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-0"><a href="/tags/dagenham" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Dagenham</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-1"><a href="/tags/havering" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">havering</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-2"><a href="/tags/christmas" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Christmas</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-3"><a href="/tags/covid" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Covid</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-4"><a href="/tags/coronavirus" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Coronavirus</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-5"><a href="/tags/guidance" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Guidance</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-6"><a href="/tags/nhs" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">NHS</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-7"><a href="/tags/safety" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Safety</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-8"><a href="/tags/community" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">community</a></li></ul></div>

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP Angus MacNeil is reiterating his urgent call for Covid-19 testing to be available in the Western Isles for offshore workers prior to their journey to work.</p>



<p>Concerned oil workers from the islands have contacted Mr MacNeil regarding the situation which means they are being forced to travel to a Tier 4 area to be tested for Covid-19 before going on to offshore platforms.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has now written again to Health Secretary Jean Freeman to stress the need for local testing of workers.</p>



<p>He said: “Again I’ve had the spectre of oil workers coming to me regarding this situation.</p>



<p>“It is worse now as they are having to leave the Tier 1 Hebrides to go to what will be Tier 4 areas for testing to go off on oil rigs on January 3 or 4, having to leave for testing on Hogmanay.</p>



<p>“Given the alarm that the Government has raised about the new strain of Covid, surely this means that the Government has to react to minimise the risk that people have of coming into contact with it.</p>



<p>“This is particularly so when we know we have capacity to test in the Hebrides with NHS testing.</p>



<p>“It would seem sensible to keep people out of harm’s way. Going to places where Covid is far more prevalent to get testing seems bizarrely daft.</p>



<p>“Testing in the islands would be far a safer and more sensible approach for people going away.</p>



<p>“I’ve written to Jeanne Freeman on this today as well as on the 23rd of November. I haven’t had a response yet but I am hoping for a quick response this time given the Government’s concern about the new strain of Covid.”</p>

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP John Penrose has welcomed news the Government will drop proposals to increase North Somerset’s housebuilding targets from 1,365 to 1,708 a year.</p>



<p>This announcement comes just months after John wrote to Ministers raising concerns that the proposed new housebuilding targets were unrealistic and weeks after John and Liam Fox raised the issue in a debate on housebuilding in North Somerset. John made the point that the algorithm being used&nbsp;encouraged environmentally damaging housebuilding over green fields rather than investment and regeneration in urban areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John said: &#8220;It&#8217;s great that the Government has listened to what I, Liam Fox, North Somerset Council and others have been saying. This is a big step in the right direction, although the existing building targets are still pretty high. But if we Build Up Not Out in urban areas like central Weston or Bristol, and use local Council-approved Design Codes so the new builds match the best of what’s already here, we can build a lot more green, good-looking homes that local people can afford, that are close to work, transport-links, shops, schools and GP surgeries, and which revive our town centres and High Streets too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am very sorry to have to send you another update so soon after the last one, but most of you will now have seen the latest restrictions being introduced for our area. I know many of you will be very upset about what has happened and its impact on Christmas and on local businesses – I am as disappointed and unhappy as many of you will be.</p>
<p>I thought it would be helpful for you to see all of the rules that now apply, as there are some differences from November. Apologies for the length of the email – there’s quite a lot of detail.</p>

<p><strong>This is the Tier 4 guidance. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Stay at home</strong></h2>
<p>You must not leave or be outside of your home except for where you have a specific purpose, or a ‘reasonable excuse’. A reasonable excuse includes:</p>
<h3><strong>Work and volunteering</strong></h3>
<p>You can leave home for work purposes, where your place of work remains open and where you cannot work from home (including if your job involves working in other people’s homes).</p>
<h3><strong>Essential activities</strong></h3>
<p>You can leave home to buy things at shops which are permitted to open in your area, but you should stay local. For instance you can leave home to buy food or medicine, or to collect any items &#8211; including food or drink &#8211; ordered through click-and-collect or as a takeaway, to obtain or deposit money (e.g. from a bank or post office), or to access critical public services (see section below).</p>
<h3><strong>Fulfilling legal obligations</strong></h3>
<p>You may also leave home to fulfil legal obligations, or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or vote in certain elections taking place overseas.</p>
<h3><strong>Education and childcare</strong></h3>
<p>You can leave home for education (formal provision, rather than extracurricular classes such as music or drama tuition, or out of school settings) or training, registered childcare and supervised activities for children that are necessary to allow parents/carers to work, seek work, undertake education or training, or attend a medical appointment. Parents can still take their children to school, and people can continue existing arrangements for contact between parents and children where they live apart. This <u>includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">childcare bubbles</a>.</u></p>
<h3><strong>Meeting others and care</strong></h3>
<p>1 in 3 people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and will be spreading it without realising it.</p>
<p>You can leave home to visit people in your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a>, or to provide informal childcare for children aged 13 and under as part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">childcare bubble</a>, to provide care for vulnerable people, to provide emergency assistance, attend a support group (of up to 15 people), or for respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked after child.</p>
<h3><strong>Exercise and recreation</strong></h3>
<p>People can also exercise outdoors or visit some public outdoor places, such as parks, the countryside, public gardens or outdoor sports facilities. You can continue to do unlimited exercise alone, or in a public outdoor place with your household, support bubble, or one other person.</p>
<h3><strong>Medical reasons, harm and compassionate visits</strong></h3>
<p>You can leave home for any medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and emergencies, to be with someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse),or for animal welfare reasons – such as to attend veterinary services for advice or treatment.</p>
<p>You can also leave home to visit someone who is dying or someone in a care home (if permitted under care home guidance), hospice, or hospital, or to accompany them to a medical appointment.</p>
<h3><strong>Communal worship and life events</strong></h3>
<p>You can leave home to attend a place of worship for communal worship, a funeral or a related event for someone who has died, or to visit a burial ground or a remembrance garden, or to attend a wedding &#8211; but funerals, linked events and weddings are all subject to limits on the numbers that can attend (see below).</p>
<h3><strong>Meeting others safely</strong></h3>
<p>In general, you must not meet with another person socially or undertake any activities with another person. However, you can exercise or meet in a public outdoor place with people you live with, your support bubble (or as part of a childcare bubble), or with one other person.</p>
<p>You should minimise time spent outside your home. When around other people, stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household &#8211; meaning the people you live with &#8211; or your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a>. Where this is not possible, stay 1 metre apart with extra precautions (e.g. wearing a face covering).</p>
<p>You must not meet socially indoors with family or friends unless they are part of your household or support bubble.</p>
<p>You can exercise or visit a public outdoor place</p>
<ul>
<li>by yourself</li>
<li>with the people you live with,</li>
<li>with your support bubble,</li>
<li>or, when on your own, with 1 person from another household.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children under 5, and up to two carers for a person with a disability who needs continuous care are <strong>not</strong> counted towards the outdoors gatherings limit.</p>
<p>Public outdoor places include:</p>
<ul>
<li>parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forests</li>
<li>public gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them)</li>
<li>allotments</li>
<li>the grounds of a heritage site</li>
<li>outdoor sports courts and facilities</li>
<li>playgrounds</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot meet people in a private garden, unless you live with them or have formed a support bubble with them.</p>
<p>You must wear a face covering in many indoor settings, such as shops or places of worship where these remain open, and on public transport, unless you are exempt. This is the law. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Read guidance on face coverings.</a></p>
<h3><strong>Support and childcare bubbles</strong></h3>
<p>There is separate guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubbles</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">childcare bubbles</a> across all tiers. You can form a support bubble with another household if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are the only adult in your household (any other members of the household having been under 18 on 12 June 2020), or are an under 18 year old living without any adults</li>
<li>you live with someone with a disability who requires continuous care and there is no other adult living in the household</li>
<li>you live with a child under 1, or who was under 1 on 2 December 2020</li>
<li>you live with a child under 5, or who was under 5 on 2 December 2020, with a disability</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to change your support bubble if your circumstances change. Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household#changing-your-support-bubble">changing your support bubble</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Where and when you can meet in larger groups</strong></h3>
<p>There are still circumstances in which you are allowed to meet others from outside your household or support bubble in larger groups, but this should not be for socialising and only for permitted purposes. A full list of these circumstances will be included in the regulations, and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>for work, or providing voluntary or charitable services. This includes picketing outside workplaces. This can include work in other people’s homes where necessary &#8211; for example, for nannies, cleaners or tradespeople. See guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes">working safely in other people’s homes</a>). Where a work meeting does not need to take place in a private home or garden, it should not &#8211; for example, although you can meet a personal trainer, you should do so in a public outdoor public place.</li>
<li>in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">childcare bubble</a>(for the purposes of childcare only)</li>
<li>for registered childcare, or for supervised activities for children where this enables a parent to work, seek work, attend education or training, or for respite care</li>
<li>education or training &#8211; meaning education related to a formal curriculum or training that relates to work or obtaining work</li>
<li>for arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardians</li>
<li>to allow contact between birth parents and children in care, as well as between siblings in care</li>
<li>for prospective adopting parents to meet a child or children who may be placed with them</li>
<li>for birth partners</li>
<li>to provide emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm</li>
<li>to see someone who is dying</li>
<li>to fulfil a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury service</li>
<li>for gatherings within criminal justice accommodation or immigration detention centres</li>
<li>to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-unpaid-care/guidance-for-those-who-provide-unpaid-care-to-friends-or-family">provide care or assistance to someone vulnerable</a>, or to provide respite for a carer</li>
<li>for a wedding or equivalent ceremony in exceptional circumstances, as set out below.</li>
<li>for funerals &#8211; up to a maximum of 30 people. Wakes and other linked ceremonial events can continue in a group of up to 6.</li>
<li>to visit someone at home who is dying, or to visit someone receiving treatment in a hospital, hospice or care home, or to accompany a family member or friend to a medical appointment</li>
<li>for elite sportspeople (and their coaches if necessary, or parents/guardians if they are under 18) to compete and train</li>
<li>to facilitate a house move</li>
</ul>
<p>Support groups that have to be delivered in person can continue with up to 15 participants where formally organised to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support &#8211; but they must take place at a premises other than a private home. This includes, but is not limited to, support to victims of crime, people in drug and alcohol recovery, new parents and guardians, people caring for those with long-term or terminal illnesses, or who are vulnerable, people facing issues relating to their sexuality or gender, those who have suffered bereavement, and vulnerable young people, including for them to meet youth workers.</p>
<p>Parent and child groups can continue where they provide support to parent and/or child, and children under 5 will not be counted within the 15 person limit &#8211; meaning parents and carers can attend such groups in larger numbers. These cannot take place in private dwellings.</p>
<p>Where a group includes someone covered by an exception (for example, someone who is working or volunteering), they are not generally counted as part of the gatherings limit. This means, for example, a tradesperson can go into a household without breaching the limit, if they are there for work, and the officiant at a wedding would not count towards the limit.</p>
<h3><strong>If you break the rules</strong></h3>
<p>The police can take action against you if you meet in larger groups. This includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing fines (fixed penalty notices).</p>
<p>You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400. If you hold, or are involved in holding, an illegal gathering of over 30 people, the police can issue fines of £10,000.</p>
<h3><strong>Keeping you and your friends and family safe</strong></h3>
<p>When meeting friends and family you should also:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">guidance on social distancing and letting in fresh air</a></li>
<li>limit how many different people you see socially over any period of time</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Protecting people more at risk from coronavirus</strong></h3>
<p>If you are clinically vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. You:</p>
<ul>
<li>should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others</li>
<li>should continue to wash your hands carefully and more frequently than usual and maintain thorough cleaning of frequently touched areas in your home and/or workspace</li>
</ul>
<p>Clinically vulnerable people are those who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>aged 70 or over (regardless of medical conditions)</li>
<li>under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (that is, anyone instructed to get a flu jab each year on medical grounds):
<ul>
<li>chronic (long-term) mild to moderate respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis</li>
<li>chronic heart disease, such as heart failure</li>
<li>chronic kidney disease</li>
<li>chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis</li>
<li>chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) or cerebral palsy</li>
<li>diabetes</li>
<li>problems with the spleen</li>
<li>a weakened immune system as the result of certain conditions or medicines they are taking (such as steroid tablets)</li>
<li>being seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above)</li>
<li>pregnant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a further group of people who are defined, also on medical grounds, as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> to coronavirus – that is, people with specific serious health conditions. Over this period, we are advising the clinically extremely vulnerable to work from home. If you cannot work from home, you are advised not to go to work and may be eligible for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), Employment Support Allowance (ESA) or Universal Credit. We are advising clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home as much as possible, except to go outdoors for exercise or to attend health appointments. You may wish to meet up with one other person from outside your household or support bubble, for example, to exercise in an outdoor public place, but we suggest that you always try to do so as safely as possible. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">Please follow the guidance set out in the shielding section of the CEV guidance</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Travel</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Travelling within a tier 4 area</strong></h3>
<p>If you live in a tier 4 area, you must stay at home. You must not leave your home to travel unless for work, education or other legally permitted reasons. If you need to travel you should stay local &#8211; meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live &#8211; and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall. The list of reasons you can leave your home and area include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>work, where you cannot work from home</li>
<li>accessing education and for caring responsibilities</li>
<li>visiting those in your support bubble &#8211; or your childcare bubble for childcare</li>
<li>visiting hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health</li>
<li>buying goods or services from premises that are open in Tier 4 areas, including essential retail, but these should be within your local area wherever possible</li>
<li>spending time or exercising outdoors. This should be done locally wherever possible, but you can travel a short distance within your Tier 4 area to do so if necessary (for example, to access an open space)</li>
<li>attending the care and exercise of a pet, or veterinary services</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practise social distancing while you travel.</p>
<p>Avoid car sharing with anyone from outside your household or your support bubble. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#private-cars-and-other-vehicles">guidance on car sharing</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to use public transport, you should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">safer travel guidance.</a></p>
<h4><strong>Travelling out of a tier 4 area</strong></h4>
<p>You must stay at home and not leave your Tier 4 area, other than for legally permitted reasons such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel to work where you cannot work from home</li>
<li>travel to education and for caring responsibilities</li>
<li>visit those in your support bubble &#8211; or your childcare bubble for childcare</li>
<li>attend hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of exceptions will be published in the Regulations.</p>
<h4><strong>Travelling to a tier 4 area from a tier 1, 2 or 3 area</strong></h4>
<p>You should not travel into a Tier 4 area from another part of the UK, other than for reasons such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel to work where you cannot work from home</li>
<li>travel to education and for caring responsibilities</li>
<li>to visit those in your support bubble &#8211; or your childcare bubble for childcare</li>
<li>to attend hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health</li>
</ul>
<p>You should continue to practise safe behaviours on public transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>plan ahead, check for disruption before you leave, and avoid the busiest routes, as well as busy times</li>
<li>avoid making unnecessary stops during your journey</li>
<li>avoid sharing a car with people not in your household</li>
<li>keep your distance from other people when you travel, where possible</li>
<li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>International travel to or from a tier 4 area</strong></h4>
<p>If you are in Tier 4, you should not be travelling abroad unless it is permitted. In addition, you should consider the public health advice in the country you are visiting.</p>
<p>If you live outside a tier 4 area you may still transit into or through a tier 4 area to travel abroad if you need to, but you should carefully consider whether you need to do so. In addition, you should follow the public health advice in the country you’re visiting.</p>
<p>If you do need to travel overseas from a tier 4 area (and are legally permitted to do so, for example, because it is for work), even if you are returning to a place you&#8217;ve visited before, you should look at the rules in place at your destination and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice</a>.</p>
<p>UK residents currently abroad do not need to return home immediately. However, you should check with your airline or travel operator on arrangements for returning.</p>
<h4><strong>Staying away from home overnight</strong></h4>
<p>You cannot leave home for holidays or stays overnight away from your main home unless permitted by law. This means that holidays in the UK and abroad are not allowed. This includes staying in a second home or caravan, or staying with anyone you do not live with or are in a support bubble with.</p>
<p>You are allowed to stay overnight away from your home if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are unable to return to your main residence</li>
<li>need accommodation while moving house</li>
<li>need accommodation to attend a funeral or related commemorative event</li>
<li>require accommodation for work purposes or to provide voluntary services</li>
<li>are a child requiring accommodation for school or care</li>
<li>are homeless, seeking asylum or a vulnerable person seeking refuge</li>
<li>are an elite athlete or their support staff or parent, if the athlete is under 18 and it is necessary to be outside of the home for training or competition</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already on holiday in a Tier 4 area, you should return to your home as soon as practical</p>
<p>Guest accommodation providers such as hotels, B&amp;Bs and caravan parks may remain open for the specific reasons set out in law, including where guests are unable to return to their main residence, use that guest accommodation as their main residence, need accommodation while moving house, are self-isolating as required by law, or would otherwise be made homeless as a result of the accommodation closing. Accommodation providers are also encouraged to work cooperatively with Local Authorities to provide accommodation to vulnerable groups including the homeless in tier 4 areas.</p>
<h3><strong>Businesses and venues</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Businesses and venues which must close</strong></h4>
<p>To reduce social contact, the regulations require some businesses to close and impose restrictions on how some businesses provide goods and services. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-essential retail, such as clothing and homeware stores, vehicle showrooms (other than for rental), betting shops, tailors, tobacco and vape shops, electronic goods and mobile phone shops, and market stalls selling non-essential goods &#8211; these venues can continue to be able to operate click-and-collect (where goods are pre-ordered and collected off the premises) and delivery services</li>
<li>hospitality venues such as cafes, restaurants, pubs, bars and social clubs; with the exception of providing food and drink for takeaway (until 11pm), click-and-collect, drive-through or delivery</li>
<li>accommodation such as hotels, hostels, guest houses and campsites, except for specific circumstances, such as where these act as someone’s main residence, where the person cannot return home, for homeless people, or where it is essential to stay there for work purposes</li>
<li>leisure and sports facilities such as leisure centres and indoor gyms, indoor swimming pools, indoor tennis and basketball courts, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor climbing walls</li>
<li>entertainment venues such as theatres, concert halls, cinemas, museums and galleries, casinos, amusement arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, skating rinks, go-karting venues, indoor play and soft play centres and areas (including inflatable parks and trampolining centres), circuses, fairgrounds, funfairs, zoos and other animal attractions, water parks and theme parks</li>
<li>indoor attractions at botanical gardens, heritage homes and landmarks must also close, though outdoor grounds of these premises can stay open</li>
<li>personal care facilities such as hair, beauty, tanning and nail salons. Tattoo parlours, spas, massage parlours, body and skin piercing services must also close. It is also prohibited to provide these services in other people’s homes</li>
<li>community centres and halls must close except for a limited number of exempt activities, as set out below. Libraries can also remain open to provide access to IT and digital services &#8211; for example for people who do not have it at home &#8211; and for click-and-collect services</li>
</ul>
<p>These businesses and places will also be permitted to be open for a small number of exempt activities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>education and training &#8211; for schools to use sports, leisure and community facilities where that is part of their normal provision</li>
<li>childcare purposes and supervised activities for children</li>
<li>hosting blood donation sessions and food banks</li>

<li>for training and rehearsal without an audience (in theatres and concert halls)</li>
<li>for the purposes of professional film and TV filming</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Businesses and venues which can remain open</strong></h3>
<p>Other businesses and venues are permitted to stay open, following COVID-19 Secure guidelines. This includes those providing essential goods and services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>essential retail such as food shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, garden centres and Christmas tree retailers, building merchants and suppliers of building products and off-licences</li>
<li>market stalls selling essential retail may also stay open</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Public Services</strong></h3>
<p>The majority of public services will continue and you will be able to leave home to visit them. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the NHS and medical services like GPs and dentists. We are supporting the NHS to carry out urgent and non-urgent services safely, and it is vital anyone who thinks they need any kind of medical care comes forward and seeks help</li>
<li>Jobcentre Plus sites</li>
<li>courts and probation services</li>
<li>civil registrations offices</li>
<li>passport and visa services</li>
<li>services provided to victims</li>
<li>waste or recycling centres</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Going to work</strong></h2>
<p>To help contain the virus, everyone who can work effectively from home should do so.</p>
<p>Where people cannot do so &#8211; including, but not limited to, people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction, or manufacturing &#8211; they should continue to travel to their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting sectors and employers.</p>
<p>Public sector employees working in essential services, including childcare or education, should continue to go into work.</p>
<p>Where it is necessary for you to work in other people&#8217;s homes &#8211; for example, for nannies, cleaners or tradespeople &#8211; you can do so. Otherwise, you should avoid meeting for work in a private home or garden, where COVID-19 Secure measures may not be in place.</p>
<p>The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-19 secure guidelines</a> are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Going to school, college and university</strong></h2>
<p>Schools and colleges will remain open during term time in Tier 4 areas. The Government will continue to prioritise the wellbeing and long-term futures of our young people. It remains very important for children and young people to attend, to support their wellbeing and education and help working parents and guardians. Senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be, and so they should continue to go to school during term time.</p>
<h2><strong>Universities</strong></h2>
<p>We expect that the majority of students, other than those who need or choose to remain at university, will now have returned to their family home during the ‘student travel window’. We have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/student-movement-and-plans-for-the-end-of-autumn-2020-term">published guidance on how they can do so safely.</a></p>
<p>We have also published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/students-returning-to-higher-education-from-spring-term">guidance to universities and students on how students can return safely to higher education in the spring term</a>. This guidance sets out how we will support higher education providers to enable students to return as safely as possible following the winter break, by staggering this process and to facilitate testing for all.</p>
<p>If you live at university, you should not move back and forward between your permanent home and student home during term time.</p>
<p>Universities should follow guidance on reopening buildings to ensure they have safety measures in place to minimise the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>If you’re a student, you can meet in groups of more than your household as part of your formal education or training. Students should expect to follow the guidance and restrictions. You should socially distance from anyone you do not live with wherever possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Schools</strong></h2>
<p>The Government has confirmed that all secondary schools and colleges in England will be offered help, support and facilities to implement an additional round of free coronavirus testing from the first week of January.</p>
<p>This will be alongside a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-and-childcare-settings-return-in-january-2021/schools-and-childcare-settings-return-in-january-2021">staggered return to face-to-face education</a> in secondary schools, starting with exam years, vulnerable children and children of critical workers.</p>
<p>The offer of tests builds on the extensive protective measures already in place in schools and colleges to make them safe, as well as the government’s recent announcement that every secondary school and college in England will have access to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secondary-schools-and-colleges-to-get-weekly-coronavirus-testing">rapid testing</a> from January.</p>
<p>In schools and colleges where year 7 and above are educated, face coverings should be worn by adults (staff and visitors) and pupils when moving around indoors, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing is difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/education-and-childcare">guidance for teachers, school leaders, carers and parents on education and childcare</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Childcare</strong></h2>
<p>There are several ways that parents and carers can continue to access childcare in Tier 4 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>early years settings and childminders remain open, and you can continue to use these settings as normal</li>
<li>you can access other childcare activities (including wraparound care) where reasonably necessary to enable parents to work, seek work, attend education or training</li>
<li>nannies will be able to continue to provide services, including in the home</li>
<li>parents are able to form a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household">childcare bubble</a> with one other household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under</li>
<li>some households will also be able to benefit from being in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some youth services are able to continue, such as 1-1 youth work and support groups, but most youth clubs and groups will need to cease for this period.</p>
<h2><strong>Visiting relatives in care homes</strong></h2>
<p>Visits to care homes can take place with arrangements such as substantial screens, visiting pods, or behind windows.</p>
<p>Close-contact indoor visits supported by testing, which are allowed in Tiers 1-3, will not be allowed in Tier 4. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes">This</a> guidance will be updated shortly clarifying how visits in Tier 4 should be conducted.</p>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Worcester MP, Robin Walker, has welcomed the Government’s announcement that Worcestershire County Council will see its budget boosted by 5.3 per cent next year, as part of the Conservatives’ commitment to level up local services across the country and give them the resources they need to support their communities as we recover from the pandemic.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Local authorities in England, including Worcestershire County Council, will receive a share of £51.2 billion local government funding next year – up £2.2 billion on this year. Funding for key public services will again be protected, with significant extra resources dedicated to areas where they are needed most. Thanks to the investment being made by the Conservatives, Worcestershire will have an extra £20.27 million to spend next year.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The local government finance settlement sets out how much councils have to spend vital local services each year, including social care which will see a £1 billion increase in funding next year as a result of the announcement. In total, local authorities across England will receive an extra £5 billion in support next year, including a further £1.55 billion in additional grant funding to cover costs relating to the pandemic and an extra £670 million to help families facing hardship with their council tax bills.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is on top of the more than £7.2 billion in additional funding given to local areas throughout the pandemic so far to protect vital services that have kept vulnerable people and communities safe.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Commenting, Robin said:  </b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Local authorities play a vital role in our communities, providing the crucial local services that people rely on every day. Worcester residents will benefit as their county council will have an additional £20 million in funding this year thanks to the Government. These funds will help our local leaders make positive change in the area.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“This builds on the significant funding boost the council received at the beginning of the year, underlying our determination to ensure all local authorities have the resources they need to drive forward our recovery in a way that works for our community as we build back better after the pandemic.”</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Commenting, Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said:  </b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Councils have played a critical role leading their communities during the pandemic and delivering vital local services to vulnerable people and we have supported them with £7.2 billion extra funding to date.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“That’s why I am announcing a financial package that will provide over £5 billion of extra support next year. This will give councils the resources they need to lead the recovery of their communities while delivering the services that people rely on.”</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Thanks to measures introduced by the Conservatives, taxpayers in Worcester now have a stronger voice over council tax rises than ever before.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This means local residents have the power to veto excessive council tax rises, with a referendum being required if councils propose raising the tax by 2% or more; Councils with responsibility for adult social care will be able to set a further 3% increase, ring-fenced exclusively for adult social care. Anything above this level will also need to be voted on by local people. This strikes the right balance between addressing pressure on services and giving council-tax payers the final say on excessive increases.</p>

<p>2020 has left us with many legacies as we’ve coped with a set of circumstances none of us would have imagined. As we look to the light provided by new vaccines and as we approach a new year, there is yet another nasty legacy sting in the tail of 2020 – a rise in feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p>Research from Age UK has shown that this Christmas is set to be the loneliest yet for older people. Over 160,000 people over the age of 65 will suffer from feeling lonely this festive season, with nearly 60% of them fearing that they won’t see any family and friends. Those are heartbreaking numbers, even one person feeling like this is one too many.</p>
<p>Our communities can carry another more positive legacy from 2020. The Age UK research also highlighted that over 100,000 older people were helped to get through the pandemic by the kindness of strangers. The simple act of checking on people made a life-enhancing difference for so many, we can never know for sure, but it’s probably safe to assume that in some instances, it was life-saving.</p>
<p>Of course, loneliness and isolation don’t discriminate; young people are also affected. The Office of National statistics were able to point out that, during the first month of the pandemic, 7. 4 million people, across the nations of the UK said that their wellbeing was affected through feeling isolated.</p>
<p>We all knew that these restrictions were essential to protect lives, but the collateral effect was, as predicted, substantial. Recently, we have become more aware of a problem that has existed for some time but rarely brought into public debate. Work undertaken for the charities MIND and Mental Health UK confirmed that young people are particularly affected by loneliness.</p>
<p>During the pandemic almost half of 18-24-year-olds experienced, and those aged 25-34 are twice – yes twice – as likely to be lonely at Christmas than older people. That’s a lot of lonely people out there feeling isolated.</p>
<p>While we cannot visit indoors, there are many other ways we can help people feel less isolated. Given that a third of people are too embarrassed to admit that they are lonely, it is small acts that make a difference; it might be a note through the door or a phone call to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. Simple offers of contact, help with shopping, a chat a few steps back from the doorstep could mean a big deal to reassure folk that they are valued and to feel a little less alone.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Over half of all bus journeys in England take place within just one city. It won’t surprise you to know that the city in question is London, but that statistic is still shocking. In 2018/19, 2.2 billion bus journeys were made in the capital compared to 2.12 billion in the whole of the rest of the country. And each year the gap in bus use between London and the rest of England grows. Over the past decade, bus use in London has decreased by just 1.4%, whilst elsewhere it has shrunk by an incredible 11.4%.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">There are, of course, many reasons for this imbalance between London and the rest of the country, but they are all linked. The fact is that London has the best bus system in the country – the buses are cheaper, more frequent, there are more routes and they are integrated with other public transport. That London has better buses is no accident. It all comes back to Margaret Thatcher’s Tory Government in the 80s, which deregulated buses everywhere in England… other than London.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">I’ve written about how immensely damaging this deregulation has been for Greater Manchester previously. Our buses are far too expensive (all bus journeys in London are just £1.50, including unlimited changes within 90 minutes), too irregular and we have to fight to keep vital routes running as some private operators focus on profit over service.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Unfortunately, this deregulation has created something of a vicious circle. The worse our bus services become, the fewer people use them, which leads them to get even worse and even fewer people to use them, and so on and so on. We need to break this cycle.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Luckily, our Metro Mayor Andy Burnham gets this and wants major reform of our buses, bringing them under local control. There is a consultation on the proposals for a new franchising system and I’d encourage you to take part at<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.gmconsult.org/">www.gmconsult.org</a><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>before the 29 January deadline.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Buses are a vital lifeline for those without access to private cars, but they should be much more than that. In the future for transport that I’d like to see, buses would be the preferred method of transport for local journeys by those both with and without cars. For this to become a reality though, we urgently need a better bus system where taking the bus is a cheap, convenient and pleasant experience. Thankfully, I think Greater Manchester is heading firmly in that direction.</p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced policing will receive up to £15.8 billion in 2021-22 – an increase of £636 million on last year.</p>

<p>This includes over £400 million to recruit 20,000 extra police officers by 2023, delivering on the promise made by the Conservatives in last year’s General Election. West Mercia has already benefited from an additional 105 officers.</p>

<p>The funding will be also be used to bolster counter-terrorism policing, including money for armed policing and more officers.</p>

<p>The Conservative Government has been determined to support the police throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as officers have worked tirelessly to keep communities safe. The Government has provided £30 million to help forces step up coronavirus enforcement and has reimbursed forces for all additional PPE purchased between March and July.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne said:</p>

<p>“Officers and staff at West Mercia have been instrumental in keeping our community safe this year, and I pay tribute to them for their hard work and professionalism, particularly in this challenging year. I have engaged with Police leaders here in Shropshire throughout the pandemic, and commend local officers for the way in which they have applied their tact and good judgment to keep our community safe.</p>

<p>I am delighted to see West Mercia getting an additional £13m next year. I know the presence of additional officers on our streets has already helped reassure local residents. I look forward to speaking to our Police & Crime Commissioner, John Campion, to learn how he intends to deploy the extra resource in South Shropshire.”</p></div>

<p>The MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, has welcomed that Holderness Health in his constituency is one of the first GP practices to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination against Covid-19 to their most vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>The UK became the first country in the world to approve the vaccine on 2nd December, when the independent Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency gave it the go-ahead. The NHS is now in the process of delivering the largest programme of immunisation in the country’s history, and subsequently announced that Castle Hill Hospital would act as a vaccine hub to protect the most vulnerable patients and healthcare staff in the region.</p>
<p>Now, GP practices are being added to the list of sites approved to administer the vaccine, despite health bosses having to contend with the practicalities of storing and transporting the vaccine, which must be stored between -80°C and -60°C and given to patients within six hours of being thawed.</p>
<p>As a result, Holderness Health has been chosen as one of four local Covid-19 vaccination centres in Hull and the East Riding, with more practices joining on a phased basis over the course of the coming months. The first GP-led vaccinations were carried out at Holderness Health yesterday afternoon (14th December).</p>
<p>Patients over the age of 80 with the greatest clinical risk are being offered appointments first, with priority groups determined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination &amp; Immunisation. Eventually, mass vaccinations will be offered in sports venues and conference centres once further vaccine supplies become available.</p>
<p>Graham commented, “This is fantastic news for vulnerable constituents in Beverley and Holderness, who will be among the first to be offered this vaccination by their family GPs.</p>
<p>“I know Holderness Health have plenty of experience in delivering safe and effective vaccination programmes, as they do every year with the flu jab, so I have every confidence that they will rise to the challenge despite its scale and complexity.</p>
<p>“The public can really help with this by not contacting the surgery to ask for a jab, because eligible people will be proactively contacted by phone, letter, or the national booking system.”</p>
<p>For it to be effective, people are required to have two doses of the vaccine 3 weeks apart and the NHS is urging people to ensure that they book their jabs when contacted and are emphasising the importance of attending both appointments: Dr Craig Dobson, medical advisor to the East Riding CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) said, “The vaccine has been shown to be effective and it is fantastic news that in our local area we can start to vaccinate our more vulnerable residents, who need it most.</p>
<p>“If you are in one of the priority groups, I would urge that when your GP Practice contacts you, please make sure you book and attend your appointments when you arrange them.”</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&nbsp;UK&nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’</p>

<p><strong>Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</strong></p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is encouraging all constituents to put safety first when shopping online for their Christmas presents this year.</p>
<p>With online marketplaces not bound by the same laws as traditional retailers, fake and dangerous electrical products are being sold to unknowing customers. Containing sub-standard or counterfeit parts, they present a serious risk of fire or electric shock.  In research conducted by Electrical Safety First, 14 out of 15 sampled products from third-party sellers failed basic safety tests.</p>
<p>Electrical Safety First are encouraging consumers to make sure you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller, to check packaging and the item carefully for tell-tale signs that the product is not genuine, and to check for safety certifications on labelling.</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth said: </strong></p>
<p>“With Covid restrictions still affecting everyday life, many constituents will be doing their Christmas shopping online this year.</p>
<p>“If you are planning on buying electrical goods please make sure that you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller. Avoid third-party sellers for electrical goods and if you are unsure at all when your product arrives, do not use it.</p>
<p>“I know it’s been a tough year and finances are tight, but it&#8217;s not worth risking fire and electrocution to save a few pounds”.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/12/04/bristol-south-mp-warns-constituents-about-electrical-safety-in-the-run-up-to-christmas/" target="_blank">Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p>

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday (01/12/20), Parliament was presented with a simple, for or against, choice to vote on the renewed ‘Tier’ restrictions which have subsequently come into place this morning and the additional financial support package on offer to businesses, workers and households across Gateshead and the North East.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I wanted to take some time to explain my position on this matter and why I voted against the imposition of this package yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>At the outset, I absolutely agree with experts here in Gateshead and Nationally that we must prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout our communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>I also agree that the best way to do this is through limiting social interaction especially among meetings of multiple households.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The package of restrictions are not perfect, they appear to be ever more complicated and the allocation of tiers to different regions appears to be unequal at first glance, with areas in the North and North East subjected to greater levels of restrictions compared to other parts of the UK with similar or higher rates of incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>To this end, I have formally requested the Government publish the criteria used and set out some clarity on how regions will move between tiers while we await the rollout of a number of vaccine programmes.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The restrictions in place since the spring, closing large numbers of businesses across Gateshead and limiting the trade of so many others, have had an incredibly damaging impact on the lives and livelihoods and overall wellbeing of so many people.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government has a duty and the means to provide proper financial support to these businesses and their employees, and to this end, I firmly believe they have failed. While the initial business rate grant scheme and the furlough scheme seemed generous, many millions of people have been left without any support whatsoever and continue to be ignored 9 months on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>In addition, businesses in Gateshead which have either had to remain closed or have been once again forced to close – hospitality, fitness suites and retail particularly – alongside many self employed workers; have been left with meagre amounts of support, if any, as many businesses enter what would traditionally be their busiest trading period.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government appear to have prioritised funnelling billions of pounds of tax payer money into, sometimes selective, elements of the private sector to provide inadequate PPE and an ineffective test, track and trace system. Instead, they should be prioritising financial support for businesses, employees and families affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Failure to do so has not only had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of so many people, but it has had a detrimental impact on adherence to the restrictions. The Government must understand that many people can not work from home and do not have ready access to utilities and food, and many can not afford to withstand repeated periods of self isolation without proper financial support – Statutory Sick Pay is simply totally inadequate.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Notwithstanding the urgent need to restrict the spread of Covid-19, I voted against the motion yesterday evening, as I firmly believe the Government can and must do more to provide adequate financial support for every person and business affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have raised the inadequate financial support with the Government since the spring and will continue to do so until they meet their responsibility in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Now that the North East is officially subject to tier 3 restrictions, I would urge all residents to follow the rules closely, as this is the only way we can reduce the spread of the virus enough to move down the tier system. With our infection rates declining, because of everyone’s efforts and with positive news of vaccinations in the very near future, it is imperative that we all do whatever we can to further drive down the spread of Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I hope this sets out my view clearly, however, if you have any further questions please do contact my office.</span></p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>



<p>I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.</p>



<p>It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. </p>



<p>However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.</p>



<p>Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121<sup>st</sup>
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.</p>



<p>Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.</p>



<p>Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.</p>



<p>It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.</p>



<p>We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.</p>



<p>We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.</p>



<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely<br>Cllr David Mellen<br>Leader, Nottingham City Council</p>

<p>Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. </p>



<p>Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: </p>



<p>“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.</p>



<p>“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.</p>



<p>“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.</p>



<p>“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” </p>



<p>Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25<sup>th</sup> November. </p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>Network Rail is preparing the final stages of delivering step-free access at Garforth Railway Station, it has been announced. </p>
<p>Alec had been campaigning for new step-free access at Garforth for over a decade before finally securing funds direct from the Department for Transport. Alec will continue to work closely, cross-party, with Garforth&#8217;s Independent Councillors to represent the views of residents through the planning process. </p>
<p>Announcing the scheme in 2014, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “After years of false starts and broken promises under Labour, it is a testament to the local Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke’s persistent campaigning that I can announce that this scheme is finally happening for the people of Garforth”.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Alec has been in regular contact with Transport officials pushing for firmer plans and no further delays. He also raised the matter several times in the House of Commons Chamber. </p>
<p>But today it has been announced that the final stage before construction is now underway.</p>
<p>Alec said: &#8220;Today I&#8217;m delighted that Network Rail has formalised a plan with four options for stakeholders to choose from before the submission of a full planning application to Leeds City Council. It is my hope that Leeds City Council can deal with the application swiftly to avoid no further delays&#8221;.</p>
<p>“I have been campaigning for step-free access at Garforth Station for many years. We had an original plan submitted but this then incurred unnecessary delays along the way but I have been committed to providing disabled people and pushchair users with the same access to travel as everyone else &#8211; and delivering step-free access at Garforth station will help thousands more people travel easily and without additional cost, time or stress&#8221;.</p>
<p>Previously, Garforth resident Mrs Morris said: “We’ve waited far too long for disabled access at Garforth. The elderly, disabled and those with pushchairs have not been able to use the station so we’re extremely grateful to Alec for fighting alongside us to deliver this disabled access”. </p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s Access for All programme was first launched in 2006 and has delivered more than 200 accessible routes into selected stations so far.</p>
<p>A further 1,500 stations have received smaller scale improvements such as accessible toilets, platform humps to reduce stepping distances and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment.</p>
