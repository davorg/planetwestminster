              <h3>John Redwood (Wokingham)</h3>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Government actions designed to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the burden on the NHS have done great damage to jobs, business and output. Knowing they would the government rightly made generous provision to subsidise employment, offer grants and loans to businesses, and increased benefits to people to sustain demand. This naturally led to colossal borrowing by the state and to the effective nationalisation of large parts of the economy from private hospitals to the railways.</p>
<p>The Treasury now rightly says we cannot go on with the excessive borrowing and very high levels of state spending needed during lock down. They should add that state borrowing will fall rapidly as soon as lock down is removed and a decent economic recovery is allowed and encouraged. A large number of people who have kept their better paid  jobs and been on full pay throughout the last year have money to spend as soon as they are allowed to buy services that entail face to face encounters. Many businesses will soon be back with revenue in the tills and staff on overtime again. As this happens so the amount the state spends on benefits, grants, loans and cushioning of the lockdown diminishes. So also tax revenue soars as people pay VAT on services again, income tax on earnings and transaction taxes.</p>
<p>The last thing we need is new taxes or rises in tax rates. In  order to promote recovery the Treasury should be thinking about lower rates and fewer taxes. We need a big expansion of business capacity. The danger is we lose a generation of entrepreneurs, of people working for themselves or running small businesses, as a result of the lockdowns. The  most energetic will of course flourish again, but we need to create conditions where the average, the not so highly motivated, those worried about risk taking are persuaded enterprise is for them and the odds are favourable to setting up and running a successful business.</p>
<p>The only way to get the deficit down to sensible levels and to slash additional borrowing is to promote a strong and rapid recovery. We need to be doing that from early in the new financial year, so that we just put behind us one year of huge state borrowings. Tax rises will delay and impede recovery, and will put off that new generation of businesses and self employed we will badly need to lead us out of additional debt.</p>

<p>Watching or reading the news over the past ten months or so has – unsurprisingly – not always been fun. The pandemic has been a grim time and some days it feels like the only news around is bad news. This week, I’d like to focus on some very positive and promising news right here in Tameside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sure you were just as delighted as I was when, towards the end of last year, we found out that there was not just one but three working vaccines for COVID-19. We all worked out fairly early in the pandemic that a vaccine was the only way for us to return to normality so this was probably the best news of 2020 (admittedly there wasn’t a lot of competition!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even with the vaccines approved, we knew there would be a wait as they were rolled out. Luckily for us here in Tameside, the start of this rollout has been a huge success locally. Thanks to the incredible hard work and dedication of those in our local NHS, the council, the armed forces and others, all working in careful coordination with each other, the vaccination programme is going incredibly well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approximately 90% of those over 80 have received at least one jab, which compares to 35% nationally. There has been no wastage or stockpiling and all vaccines that have been received have been distributed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is, of course, early days, but I’d like to thank everyone involved in this amazing effort for working so quickly and efficiently to vaccinate some of our residents who are most vulnerable to the virus. The quicker we get vaccinated, the quicker restrictions can be lifted and we can start to return to normality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the roll-out also shows the difference it makes putting local bodies in charge, rather than outsourcing to private companies at a national level, as we saw with the Test and Trace system, which has been incredibly expensive despite never really working. Our local health and council workers understand the situation here and this has helped them deliver this programme so successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go before all the vaccines have been given (both first and second jabs) but this is a great start and evidence from elsewhere has shown that infections will also come down as more people are vaccinated. So let’s follow restrictions to keep each other safe while we wait for our turn to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>My thoughts are with everyone affected by the terrible flooding in Skewen this week.  I’ve spoken with the leader of Council Rob Jones, local councillor Mike Harvey and colleagues Stephen Kinnock and David Rees, in whose constituency the events occurred, and offered them my full support. My thanks and admiration go to those frontline staff and emergency services who continue to work tirelessly on site. The vast majority of properties affected are in the Aberavon constituency, but if any of my constituents in surrounding streets are affected and need any help please get in touch with my office. This of course also goes for anyone else affected by flooding in parts of the Neath constituency.</p>
<p>I have attended several All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) this week.  Gareth Thomas MP was re-elected Chair and I was elected Treasurer of the APPG on Mutuals. We heard presentations from Robin Fieth, Chief Executive of the Building Societies Association, Kate Creagh, Public Affairs Manager, BSA, Rose Marley, Chief Executive, Co-operatives UK and Martin Shaw, Chief Executive of the Association of Financial Mutuals, which represents 45 Mutuals/Friendlies/Not for Profits in UK. All contributions outlined the benefits of mutuals. The BSA represents 49 building societies and credit unions in the UK, but as a Labour and Co-operative MP, I was particularly interested in Co-operatives UK, which represents 7063 independent co-ops in the UK, and 241,714 employees and aims to create new livelihoods, keep jobs in local communities, and use local assets to transfer Coronavirus community spirit into local social actions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the MPs and Peers of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Steel and Metal related industries met for the first time in 2021 in a meeting that was extremely well attended. Members of the APPG were able to welcome Lord Grimstone, the Minister for Investment at DIT and BEIS who holds Steel within his responsibilities, to the meeting and to question him on his priorities for the sector and vision for the UK steel sector and government working together. Lord Grimstone emphasised that, while new to the role, he understood that he could be a champion within Government for the sector on issues such as procurement and committed to meeting with members of the APPG on individual issues where appropriate.</p>
<p>Additionally, APPG members had the opportunity to hear from Frank Aaskov of UK Steel, who gave a preview of ‘Closing the Gap’, UK Steel’s fifth annual report into the industrial energy price disparity faced by our steel producers compared to those in France and Germany. As with years previously, the figures continue to be eye-watering, and MPs were interested to hear about what individual steps recommended in the report would each mean. When the report is formally launched on the 4th February, MPs will have access to a full suite of suggested talking points and suggested Parliamentary Questions as we urge the government to take action on this continuing disadvantage our steelmakers face.</p>
<p>I attended the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group made up of 26 Labour and Co-operative MPs plus many Peers. We made plans to build on the successful Parliamentary campaigns we held in 2020 in association with trade unions, such as protecting shop workers and promoting the co-operative values in Parliament in 2021. We discussed campaigning in the forthcoming May elections, in which we have a record number of candidates standing under the Labour and Co-operative banner for national and Police and Crime Commissioner elections. We also looked towards campaigning in the local government elections to be held in 2022.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday I attended the APPG for Gaps in Support, which was set up at the start of the first lockdown for the specific purpose of highlighting the several million people who have been left without support, such as freelancers and some small business owners. This month’s meeting focused on the potentially 2 million active non-employing limited companies that have received little help from the UK Government since last March, and ForgottenUK’s proposal for a ‘Directors Income Support Scheme’. The well-crafted DISS proposal addresses the Government’s concerns with providing support to directors of limited companies by basing any grants on a company’s taxable profits and not dividends. The meeting was well attended by a range of cross-party MPs, as well as representatives from employment status bodies and sector federations.</p>
<p>A new Covid recovery app was launched this week in Wales for people recovering from Covid or living with the effects of Long Covid. The app has been designed to offer people a bespoke tool to monitor symptoms and track the progress of your recovery. It includes advice from consultants, therapists, psychologists, dieticians and other experts in how best to support yourself with your symptoms. GPs are still incredibly important in signposting help and providing the necessary medical tests and advice, but this app is a great resource in monitoring any changes in symptoms that indicate you need to seek medical advice. To download the app, search ‘Covid Recovery’ in the App Store or Google Play.</p>
<p>Remember, you can keep up to date with Welsh Government announcements on their dedicated <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus">coronavirus page</a>, and you can also find useful information on my Facebook and Twitter accounts.  As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

<p>I spoke to a number of care homes this week about the vaccine roll-out in Leicester. It&#8217;s very worrying to hear that some homes haven&#8217;t been able to vaccinate all of their residents and staff. The Government promised that all care homes would be vaccinated by Sunday, and they must deliver on this.</p>
<p>While it is good news that over 56,000 people have been vaccinated in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, we are still in a race against time against this virus. The rise in care home outbreaks is concerning, and I will keep raising this with the Government and the NHS to make sure everything is being done to protect our care staff and residents.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p>Llanelli’s MP, Nia Griffith, and MS, Lee Waters, have
called on Plaid Cymru run Carmarthenshire County Council to extend the
consultation period on its controversial proposal to close Welsh-medium Ysgol
Mynyddygarreg in Kidwelly so that the local community has more time to have its
voice heard.</p>



<p>Under the plans, Ysgol Mynyddygarreg is set to close at
the end of August this year with pupils transferring to Ysgol Gwenllian
instead.&nbsp; The public consultation was launched earlier this month and is
due to end on February 22<sup>nd</sup> but has come in for criticism from
parents and local residents due to it being held in the middle of the
coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>NIA GRIFFITH, Member of Parliament for Llanelli, said:</p>



<p>“This is a massively important decision that will affect
the future of education in the area for generations to come.&nbsp; Local people
and those who rely on the school must have every opportunity to have their
voice heard.</p>



<p>Staff and governors at the school are extremely busy at
the moment just trying to keep things going as normally as possible.&nbsp; As a
result of the pandemic and the current lockdown, parents are also under the
cosh now that they have to do their best to support their children’s home
learning as well.&nbsp; </p>



<p>To have this consultation come at such a difficult time
is not helping and the onus is now on the Plaid Council to be more sympathetic
and extend the period for people to respond to the closure plan and give them
more of a chance to get their views across before any decisions are made.”</p>



<p>In 2018, Welsh Government guidelines were changed so that
there was a presumption against the closure of small rural schools. Council’s
must now explain why closure is the ‘most appropriate’ course of action, with
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams saying that all viable alternatives should
be considered first.</p>



<p>LEE WATERS, Llanelli’s Member of the Senedd, added:</p>



<p>“A little bit of flexibility from the Council on this
would go a long way in enabling everyone who will be affected by the plans to
get all the information they need to respond properly.&nbsp; Just a few weeks
extra will make a huge difference and allow for local people to make a more
informed contribution.</p>



<p>“I don’t think that the community is asking for much,
especially given the magnitude of the proposals and the exceptional
circumstances that we all find ourselves in at the present time.&nbsp; It will
also be key that when the time comes for the consultation responses to be
considered that concerns raised are answered in as much detail as possible,
taking into account the need to provide the best quality education for all
existing and future pupils.”</p>

<p>This week started with ‘Blue Monday’ – said to be the most depressing day of the year. In 2021, it’s especially important that we take the opportunity to talk about mental health. People are rightly worried about the numbers of people losing their lives to Covid and the impact on loved ones. Local business owners lie awake at night wondering how they will survive with their livelihoods intact. Families, friends and neighbours have been apart from one another – with major milestones celebrated virtually. This pandemic has been especially tough for older people, particularly those who live on their own and are already at greater risk of loneliness and social isolation; and it comes on top of an epidemic in a mental health that has roots long predating Covid.</p>

<p>Worcester will benefit from a Government announcement that £148 million will be invested to cut crime and protect people from the scourge of illegal drugs, representing the largest increase in drug treatment funding for 15 years.</p>
<p>This funding is the latest in support to Police and Crime Commissioners (PCC) across the UK and West Mercia, including a drive-in recruitment of police officers, and large increases in police budgets.</p>
<p>The £148 million package takes a system-wide approach to the problem of illegal drugs. It gives extra resources to law enforcement to dismantle organised criminal gangs and tackle the supply of drugs. At the same time, it delivers more money for drug treatment and recovery to help cut drug-related crime and the cycle of misuse and reoffending.</p>
<p>County Lines describes a specific type of criminal exploitation whereby organised crime networks exploit vulnerable young people to sell drugs across county lines to avoid concentrated police operations and building on recent successes in tackling this, the government will double the funding available for law enforcement to take down and bring to justice county lines gangs.</p>
<p>Robin believes that the £40 million of new money reaffirms the government’s commitment to tackle county lines and drugs supply and brings the total invested to £65 million since November 2019. The funding has already seen more than 3,400 people arrested, more than 550 lines closed, drugs with a street value of £9 million and £1.5 million cash seized, and more than 770 vulnerable people safeguarded.</p>
<p>Also, an extra £80 million in new money is being made available to enhance drug treatment, focussing on reducing drug-related crime and stopping the rise in drug related deaths. This new money will increase the number of treatment places for prison leavers and offenders diverted into tough and effective community sentences.  Robin has accompanied local police teams in Worcester on patrols to disrupt county lines activity an has seen first hand the meticulous work that the West Mercia Police have to undertake to combat county lines gangs.</p>
<p>As Worcester’s MP, Robin is pleased that this funding will help cut crime in Worcester and across the West Mercia area and make our streets safer, including cutting drug-fuelled crime and violence.</p>
<p>Speaking after the announcement, Robin said:</p>
<p>“I am always grateful to the officers and staff at West Mercia Police who work hard to keep residents in Worcester safe. The additional funding for West Mercia Police will go a long way to ensuring they have the resources to keep our streets safe. I know from speaking to local police officers and the proactive team that county lines poses a real challenge in places like Worcester and I am sure they will be able to  use these resources effectively to ensure that we reduce damaging crime.”</p>
<p>“I am pleased that this funding will help to enhance drug treatment, reduce drug-related crime and stop the rise in drug related deaths, having a positive effect on our community and making Worcester a safer place to be.”</p>

<p>I applaud my right hon. Friend and his colleagues across the NHS, especially here in Shropshire, for the massive effort by so many people to get this vaccination into those in the highest priority groups so quickly. However, there are still some parts of the country where only care homes and NHS frontline staff have been vaccinated, and in the South West Shropshire primary care network, no one in the community over 80 has yet received the vaccine, and none are expected to until late next week. May I ask my right hon. Friend, in common with the pleas made by a number of colleagues, to look at prioritising deliveries for those areas where the highest priority groups have yet to receive the vaccinations that they are being led to believe are now widely available?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=4070">Matt Hancock (Secretary of State for Health & Social Care) </a></h3>

<p>Across Shropshire, and Telford and the Wrekin, 14,000 doses have been delivered to the over-80s. I will look into the specific question of the primary care network that my right hon. Friend raises, because I was not aware of that fact. Clearly, Shropshire is vaccinating the over-80s but I will look into that specific. It is true that, right across the country, the catch-up is absolutely vital in areas if they are behind, because it is right that this is done fairly across the country. I will get back to my right hon. Friend with the details of the individual case that he raises.</p>

	<p>Vaccines save lives. Yet there is a lot of disinformation online deterring people from getting the vaccine. Below I have shared a frequently asked questions briefing I received from the British Society for Immunology . It provides a host of questions and answers about the Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Please note that the answers to the following questions apply only in relation to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and many will be different for other COVID-19 vaccines as they become available.</p>
<p>Please note that the answers to the following questions apply only in relation to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and many will be different for other COVID-19 vaccines as they become available.</p>
<h2><strong>Rollout</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Who is eligible to receive the vaccine?<br />
</strong>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has prioritised people for vaccination based on their risk of serious COVID-19 disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The priority order, confirmed on 2nd December and subject to logistical challenges in rollout, is as follows:</p>
<p>1.       Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers</p>
<p>2.       All those 80 years of age and over; frontline health and social care workers</p>
<p>3.       All those 75 years of age and over</p>
<p>4.       All those 70 years of age and over; clinically extremely vulnerable individuals</p>
<p>5.       All those 65 years of age and over</p>
<p>6.       All individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality</p>
<p>7.       All those 60 years of age and over</p>
<p>8.       All those 55 years of age and over</p>
<p>9.       All those 50 years of age and over</p>
<p>As more vaccine becomes available, it will be rolled out to those in each descending group.</p>
<p><strong>Why are older people being prioritised over younger people who are out of the house working?<br />
</strong>The priorities are based on reducing risk of harm. The immune system of older people differs from that of younger people and whilst the younger, working population are just as likely to become infected they are much, much less likely to become severely ill. An older person becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to result in severe COVID-19 disease. The biggest risk of mortality from COVID-19 comes with age, even more so than underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, for example, or being male or being in BAME groups. Each older generation has approximately 10 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 than the generation below it. When a vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing disease in older people, then they should be the first to receive it as they are most at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to get the vaccine if I have contracted COVID-19 and recovered?<br />
</strong>Yes. There is a lot of uncertainty about how much immunity a person gains after natural infection. The levels of immunity that we can measure so far show a lot of individual variation &#8211; some people have very few antibodies after infection but these antibodies can be boosted by vaccination. We can’t assume that everyone who has had COVID-19 would have enough immunity to protect them. It is likely that, in a significant proportion of the population, the vaccine will induce more effective and longer lasting immunity than that induced by infection. Hence it is recommended that everyone take the vaccine so that, if your immunity after disease is absent or low, it can be boosted.</p>
<p><strong>Why should a young person take the vaccine when the risk of COVID-19 mortality is so low?<br />
</strong>There is a huge variability in the symptoms and severity of COVID-19 disease between different people; from an infection with SARS-CoV-2 that doesn’t have any symptoms (asymptomatic infection) to severe COVID-19 disease resulting in hospitalisation and in some cases death. While younger people are usually at the less severe end of the spectrum this does not mean that the illness is not harmful to their health. In fact, there are many instances of long COVID that have blighted the lives of young people.</p>
<p>In addition, although we don’t yet have a lot of evidence to support this, having the vaccine might stop you being able to be part of the chain of infection that spreads the virus. So, an added benefit might be to help reduce spread of the virus for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>There is COVID-19 at my child’s school. Why aren’t my children being given the vaccine?<br />
</strong>Initial vaccine testing was not done on children. Children are at extremely low risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19 – they are at higher risk of being involved in a serious traffic accident than they are of ending up in hospital with Covid-19. So the benefits of vaccinating children are not yet clear. If the vaccine stops people from passing the infection to others, then vaccinating children in order to stop the spread of the virus will make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p><strong>Does the vaccine being developed so quickly mean that it is less safe than other vaccines?<br />
</strong>No, it doesn’t. The reasons that this was developed so quickly do not include cutting corners on safety. There are a few reasons that enabled the speed in 2020:</p>
<p>1.       Technology. These mRNA vaccines (in common with many of the approaches used for the other vaccine candidates) could be rapidly deployed for development and testing once the SARS-CoV-2 sequence became known, but this was actually done on the back of 10 years prior research using this platform.</p>
<p>2.       Scientists. A LOT of scientists contributed to this, working extra long hours to make it work and to assess the results.</p>
<p>3.       Money. Normally raising money to develop a vaccine takes a long time. At each stage you have to stop and apply for more funding to carry out the next stage. Funding applications take a year or more. In 2020 for SARS-CoV-2, rapid investment of a lot of taxpayers’ money in many countries meant there weren’t the normal financial obstacles.</p>
<p>4.       Environment. Sometimes you can develop a vaccine but can’t test it until there is an epidemic in progress. There was no problem in this regard.</p>
<p>5.       Luck. Sometimes the target that is picked for vaccine studies, which is usually something seen on the outside of the virus, is not a good candidate for raising an immune response. The S protein target on SARS-CoV-2 that most vaccine companies picked to work with turns out to be an excellent target for activating the immune response.</p>
<p>6.       Volunteer test subjects. Last but definitely not least. Tens of thousands of volunteers took part in the safety trials and the randomised control trials so recruiting volunteers was not an issue as it may be under normal circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any side effects from the vaccine?<br />
</strong>Yes, but these are generally mild. As with all vaccines, because you are stimulating the immune system you may experience some mild flu-like symptoms, but these are temporary. The most common reactions are fatigue, headache and pain at the injection site. Some people might also get chills, joint pain or fever. Younger people are more likely to get these reactions than older people.</p>
<p><strong>Should people with allergies take the vaccine?<br />
</strong>There are varying degrees of allergy. Some allergies, such as hay fever, are mild and do not pose a risk. Others are more dangerous and can lead to immediate anaphylactic shock. The vaccine should not be given to people who have a history of immediate-onset anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food. If you carry an EpiPen in case of allergic reaction, you have a history of immediate-onset anaphylaxis and so should discuss this with your doctor before getting the vaccine. All people who are vaccinated are asked not to leave immediately so that the health care professionals can check there is no anaphylaxis.</p>
<p><strong>Who should not get the vaccine? (I’m immunocompromised/pregnant etc.)<br />
</strong>The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been tested on pregnant women or children so these groups should not be vaccinated, unless a child is at high risk of severe disease for some other reason.</p>
<p>Immunocompromised people are at high risk so should get the vaccine. However, because their immune systems may not be able to make a response to vaccine they should still take other precautions against the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine tested on?<br />
</strong>There were 43,448 people in the phase 3 clinical trial, 21,720 of whom had the COVID-19 vaccine and the rest were given a placebo injection.</p>
<p>Of the COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 58% were aged between 16 and 55, 42% were aged over 55 (the oldest being 89). 35% were classified as obese, 17% were BAME, 51% were male. Volunteers were from Argentina (15%), Brazil (6%), South Africa (2%) and USA (77%). People characterised as high risk due to underlying conditions (e.g. autoimmunity, hypertension; diabetes; asthma; pulmonary, liver, or kidney disease) or due to high risk occupations were included.</p>
<p><strong>Are there risks that might have been missed in the trials, but will become apparent in the longer term?<br />
</strong>All known risks have been checked, but there may be unknown risks. Reactions to vaccines usually happen very soon after vaccination – if you have the vaccine, you are asked to wait for a few minutes as a precaution. All the initial phase 1 safety trial volunteers have been followed up for at least 4 months and no major concerns have been raised. Safety monitoring, known as pharmacovigilance, is to be continued for 2 years after the vaccine is released – in the UK, this is carried out by the MHRA.</p>
<p><strong>How are long term side effects tested/monitored?<br />
</strong>Safety monitoring is to be continued for 2 years after the vaccine is released. There is a system in place to monitor and report adverse events immediately in a process known as pharmacovigilance. In the UK, this is carried out by the MHRA.</p>
<p><strong>Has the vaccine been tested on people of different ethnicities?<br />
</strong>Yes, of the 21,720 volunteers who had the COVID-19 vaccine, 17% were BAME.</p>
<h2>Effectiveness</h2>
<p><strong>Does immunity from the vaccine last longer than immunity after getting COVID-19?<br />
</strong>We do not know the answer to this question yet because people have only been followed up for a maximum of 6 months after vaccination so far. We suspect that in some cases (e.g. mild or asymptomatic infection), the immunity elicited by the vaccine would be better than that elicited by the natural infection but we do not know for sure. But, from the concentrations of antibodies induced by the vaccine, and the rate at which these antibodies decline over time, it is looking very promising that immunity induced by the vaccine will last at least as long as the immunity induced by infection and in all likelihood it will last much longer.</p>
<p><strong>Do I still need to wear a mask or observe social distancing after receiving the vaccine?<br />
</strong>Yes. We know the vaccine can protect people from getting sick from the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the viral infection. However, we do not yet know if it will stop you getting the viral infection so you could be an asymptomatic carrier who could pass the infection onto others who may be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Also, you will not be fully protected against the disease until the second dose of vaccine.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p><strong>How do mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, work?<br />
</strong>The vaccine contains a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genetic material that codes for a specific protein from the virus. In the case of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the specific code is for the spike protein from the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The genetic material in the vaccine is mRNA, which is used as instructions for the cell to make proteins. When the vaccine is given, our cells at the site of injection take up the mRNA and make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is subsequently destroyed by the body. The spike protein is then recognised by the immune system and triggers a response. This response builds immune memory so your body can fight off SARS-CoV-2 immediately if you come across it in future. Please also see this infographic.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine still provide protection against the new strain of Coronavirus in the UK?<br />
</strong>We think it will, but we don’t yet know this for a fact. Scientists are currently carrying out tests in the lab to check this out. We expect to find out more about this in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>One of the actions of Nottingham City Council’s <a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/media/2619917/2028-carbon-neutral-action-plan-v2-160620.pdf">Carbon Neutral Action Plan</a> is to campaign for divestment and move the Nottinghamshire Local Government Pension Scheme away from fossil fuels investments. This is why ahead of their Annual General Meeting tomorrow I submitted a question on behalf of City members of the scheme, and urged the Fund to commit to consult with its members on a divestment strategy and timeline before their next AGM. This is essential to ensure the long term sustainability of the Fund and to play it’s part in the prevention of catastrophic climate change.<br> <br>The Pension Fund covers over 300 members including Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, the District Councils and many other organisations who are generally non-profit making, or are undertaking a service which was, or could be carried out by the Local Authority. It is controlled by County Councillors and the City Council has no voting rights on the Pension Fund.  <br><br> I know that the primary responsibility of the Pension Fund is to protect the financial benefits of the scheme, and now that there is growing evidence that fossil fuel investments are performing less well than comparators it is the time to grasp the divestment nettle. Currently Nottinghamshire Pension Fund holds at least £170m in fossil fuel company shares and has no investments in sustainable, low carbon or renewable energy equity funds.<br><br>Given over 1300 institutions worldwide have already committed to divestment, including at least 10 UK local government pension funds and a large number of UK universities and faith organisations, it is time for Nottinghamshire to catch up and  do its bit for a sustainable future. <br><br>You can watch the Nottinghamshire Pension Fund AGM live on <a href="https://youtu.be/wdMyWgYd-gA">Youtube</a> from tomorrow at 10:30am. Further information about the agenda of the meeting and those in attendance can be found on the <a href="https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/dms/Meetings/tabid/70/ctl/ViewMeetingPublic/mid/397/Meeting/5514/Committee/526/SelectedTab/Documents/Default.aspx">Nottinghamshire County Council website</a>. </p>

This property has sat abandoned for many years and is increasingly attracting fly tipping. Residents mentioned that as quick as the council clean up the fly tipping, it’s back again the same week.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This month Jon finally received a response from the council stating that the site was visited by an Enforcement Officer, who noted that there is a Planning notice on the building dated December 2020 with the property due to be demolished for new flats.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The council confirmed that although there is excessive waste within the confines of the property, the site is secured, and that they are unable to take any further action until the planning application is determined. A decision is due by 18th February 2021.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jon Cruddas MP said:</strong> “I don’t think this is a suitable response. Regardless of planning, the property is close to residential streets and the continuation of fly-tipping, without action, could lead to a public health issue. Not to mention an eyesore for residents which has spilled onto the highway and if left could cause an obstruction.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Jon went back to the council raising these points and today received a response. The council has informed Jon that officers have enquired with planning who holds responsibility to clear the waste while the site is waiting for planning permission.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While the council have no issues with serving the relevant enforcement notices, they must be issued to the correct parties. But thanks to Jon raising this issue the council have tasked an officer to patrol the area and refer any issues to the correct council departments accordingly. The council also informed Jon that the rubbish obstructing the post box has been removed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Havering Council have provided assurances that Jon will be kept thoroughly updated on the matter and all future actions taken.</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-2 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden clearfix"><ul class="links"><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-0"><a href="/tags/havering" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">havering</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-1"><a href="/tags/fly-tipping" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Fly-tipping</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-2"><a href="/tags/waste" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Waste</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-3"><a href="/tags/council" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Council</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-4"><a href="/tags/action" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Action</a></li></ul></div>

<p>
£5.2 billion Government money will create over 2,000 new flood defences across the country by 2027 – protecting an additional 336,000 properties, including 46,000 ‘key sites’ like schools and hospitals. Some of the funding will also provide extra support for homes and businesses to get back on their feet when affected by flooding.</p>
<p>The local MP has held talks with officials at East Riding Council and has pledged to work with them to bring more funding to the county to tackle flooding, including bringing forward more nature-based solutions and increasing public awareness of how to mitigate the worst effects of flooding.</p>
<p>The East Riding and Hull experienced traumatic flooding in the summer of 2007. By July of that year, almost 20,000 homes had been affected with repair costs numbering in the hundreds of millions. Six years later, in 2013, Beverley and Holderness was once again affected by flooding as a result of tidal surges along the Humber.</p>
<p>Graham said, “The memories of flooding in our area, particularly the floods in 2007, will never leave me as long as I live. Since then I’ve been doing work to combat flood risk, such as by chairing the River Hull Board – which helped remove sunken vessels and upgraded pumping stations.</p>
<p>“No area received more investment in the last funding cycle than the East Riding and Hull – hundreds of millions has been spent – but I really do think we should capitalise on the record funding contained in this new long-term plan to keep up the momentum.</p>
<p>“Flood risk is only going to increase as we experience the effects of climate change and more extreme weather, so we should act now to make sure we’re prepared for this.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the River Hull Board – which disbanded in autumn 2016 – was reconvened last year following the flooding experienced in winter 2019. It is now chaired by East Yorkshire MP Sir Greg Knight and is in abeyance, to be reconvened in case of emergency.</p>

			<p>In a House of Commons speech, I revealed that over half of the 14,633 Universal Credit (UC) claimants in my constituency are on social security since the start of the pandemic. I then urged the Government to keep the £20 ‘uplift’ for people claiming Universal Credit.</p>
<p>You can read my speech in full below:</p>
<p><em>Universal Credit (UC) has never been fit for purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>When introduced in 2012, it had a number of design flaws including the original 6-week wait for the first payment, a single payment to a household, usually the man, setting women’s independence back a generation, and a monthly payment period creating all sorts of problems for many who were paid weekly, fortnightly and 4-weekly.</em></p>
<p><em>But these were made even worse in 2015 when the then Chancellor did a hatchet job on social security spending. With the cuts to the taper rate and work allowance, the freeze on ‘benefit uprating’, the abolition of disability premiums, and more, by the start of the Covid pandemic approximately £33bn of support had been cut for working age people.  </em></p>
<p><em>Although for some people, UC is more slightly generous than legacy benefits, all the analysis I have seen has shown that UC is far less generous to single parent families and to disabled people.</em></p>
<p><em>UC claimants have been driven into debt, rent arrears and the increase in foodbank demand is attributed to UC’s introduction.</em></p>
<p><em>The associated negative impacts on UC claimants’ health and wellbeing is also now increasingly being understood. For example, a peer-reviewed report published in the Lancet last March showed people who moved onto Universal Credit experienced clinically significant psychological distress as a direct result. Another report from the BMJ showed that the ‘hostile and demeaning’ Universal Credit system worsened physical and mental health.  And the Health in all Policies All Party Parliamentary Group which I chair undertook an inquiry into the impacts of the changes to UC in the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Bill, predicting an increase in child poverty and a subsequent deterioration in child health; sadly, the follow analysis is showing how accurate these predictions were.</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, the discriminatory and punitive nature of UC has even been successfully challenged in the courts.</em></p>
<p><em>Fast forward to the start of the Covid pandemic, when we saw the number of UC claimants increase from over 3 million in March to over 5.6 million in July. As the crisis hit, not everyone could work from home and it was the low paid in vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and leisure who’ve been most affected. We know that this health crisis is far from over, and neither are impacts on the economy and jobs. People need reassurance, that in their time of need, like the NHS, an adequate safety net is there for them. </em></p>
<p><em>In my Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency more than half of the 14,633 claimants are now claiming UC as a result of the pandemic.</em></p>
<p><em>The response I have had from constituents about the debate in Parliament calling for the uplift to be extended has been phenomenal! And it wasn’t just those relying on UC who have written to me reflecting the Health Foundation/IPSOS Mori poll that showed 74% of the public support the increase in UC and want to see it extended beyond March.  </em></p>
<p><em>The UC APPG which I chair held an inquiry into the impact of Covid on claimants last spring and we wrote to the Chancellor with our recommendations last November. We urged him to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Retain the £20 per week uplift to standard allowance beyond April</em></li>
<li><em>Extend the £20 per week uplift to legacy benefits</em></li>
<li><em>Offer new UC claimants an initial non-repayable starter payment instead of making them wait 5 weeks for their first payment, as recommended by the Work and Pensions Select Committee</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I am still waiting for a reply to this letter.</em></p>
<p><em>Save The Children found that parents who were given the uplift predominantly used it to buy food, followed by paying the rent, bills, and essential items needed for school. They estimate that withdrawing this uplift will increase those living in poverty by half a million including 200,000 children. By 2024, the Resolution Foundation estimate that relative poverty will have increased to 23% with an additional 730,000 children living in poverty.</em></p>
<p><em>Even with this uplift people living on UC are struggling to manage. In November, Turn2Us examined the financial resilience of households on different social security support and found that 1 in 5 on UC ‘always’ run out of money compared with only 8% for people not reliant on UC.</em></p>
<p><em>Citizens’ Advice estimate that since the start of the pandemic half a million people have accrued rent arrears with an average of £730 debt. And of course, the ban on evictions also runs out at the end of March. The implications for homelessness are self-evident.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Speaker, as Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s Poverty report has shown, before Covid, there were 14.5 m people living in poverty, that’s 1 in 5 people, and this was escalating in spite of the high employment rate and an increase in the living wage. Work, seen by many as the route out of poverty was failing to deliver, with over 8 million working people living in poverty. 7 out of 10 of the 4m children living in poverty come from working families. Covid saw those already struggling to stay afloat bear the brunt of the economic and the health burden.</em></p>
<p><em>We cannot, we must not let them down. We must extend the UC and Working Tax Credit uplift, and ensure those on legacy benefits also receive the uplift.  </em></p>

<p>Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:<br><br>&#8220;Firstly, this is the official designations catching up with the reality of the situation in Barra as people have been voluntarily in Level 4 in their actions for about a week now since the first COVID-19 cases emerged.</p>



<p><br>&#8220;This is good that it is only in Barra and not impacting the other islands. It is good that the distinction has been made.</p>



<p><br>&#8220;Hopefully, we can get this Covid situation in Barra under control soon. It looks like the rate of positives is going in the right direction already but still there is much to be done. We must remember social distancing when in shops, staying at home and not travelling unnecessarily and washing our hands regularly.&#8221;&nbsp;<br><br>ENDS</p>

<p>O hell, here comes another one.</p>



<p>No one wanted to start 2021 with a third lockdown but, as the new and more-infectious strain of Covid spread, it proved too strong for the local tier system.</p>



<p>And with the NHS starting to fill up under the strain, even though covid treatments are getting better and the vaccine rollout is picking up speed, here we are again.</p>



<p>A lot of us (me included) had been hoping we could just &#8216;ride it out&#8217; by keeping elderly and vulnerable people safe while everybody else carried on fairly normally.</p>



<p>But last autumn showed that, no matter how careful they’ve been, sooner or later grandparents catch it too, particularly with the new and more-infectious strain of the disease.</p>



<p>For a retirement town like Weston with plenty of elderly folk, but where lots of local jobs depend on hard-hit hospitality and tourism too, it’s a no-win dilemma.   </p>



<p>So it’s a rubbish start to 2021. But even though a full-scale lockdown is only a temporary ‘reset’ rather than a long-term answer to the problem, this time is different because there’s hope.</p>



<p>The vaccines mean there’s a decent chance of normality returning in a few months. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The challenge is getting through until then: keeping jobs and firms alive, and not letting up on ‘hands, face, space’ in the meantime.</p>



<p>The most difficult stretch of all will be the few weeks after we’ve each been vaccinated, before our immune systems are fully booted up.</p>



<p>The temptation to go back to normal before we’re really safe will be super-strong, but we’ll all have to resist it.</p>



<p>It would be awful to catch Covid right at the end of the pandemic, after we’d stayed safe for so long. Roll on the jabs, and then perhaps we can have a normal summer!</p>

					<p><strong>Arthur ‘Laurie’ Pyle receives greeting from local MP as he celebrates his 100<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">th</span> birthday</strong></p>
<p>Laurie Pyle, a long term resident of Hatfield and Hertfordshire, has today received videos and messages from family and friends as he celebrates the 100 year milestone.</p>
<p>Mr Pyle was born on this day in 1921 in Ware, Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>He worked for many years in engineering companies- training as a toolmaker in 1936, and building the first fully automated gearboxes for commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Laurie did his part to support Britain’s war effort- making under-carriages for bombers and military aircraft, producing coal cutting machinery in Glasgow, and working on tailpieces for Spitfires and Hurricanes as well as sea mine release mechanisms in Stevenage.</p>
<p>He spent the years after the war developing and assembling parts for the famous Black and Silver Shadow bikes at Vincent Motorcycles in Stevenage, where he moved with his wife.</p>
<p>Laurie built a home for his wife and two children in Hertford in 1958, where he lived for many years until he came to live in Lowlands, Hatfield- where he resides to this day.</p>
<p>A man of many talents, Laurie learned to play the organ as a teenager and played in a dance band that toured dance halls throughout Hertfordshire and London all the way up until 1939.</p>
<p>Being told by one of his friends that he was keen on politics, Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps surprised Laurie with a video from himself, played amongst videos from friends and family.</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “It’s great to hear that you’re going strong. I am told that you are very much into politics- which is music to my ears of course.”</p>
<p>Citing the pandemic, Mr Shapps said: “ I know it’s difficult at the moment, not being able to visit one another or celebrate birthdays properly.</p>
<p>“It would’ve been great to meet you in person- and I’m sure we’ll get to do that once this time has passed.”</p>
<p>Laurie’s friends say that he is as sharp as a pin, loves politics, trading stocks on his iPad, and appreciates family time above all else.</p>

<p>Following the chaos that has hit our fishing industry when trying to export since the start of the year, this week in Parliament I raised the problems experienced by the local fishing communities in my constituency suffering as a result of the new EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement.  </p>



<p>85% of the seafood caught by my local fishing fleet is sold into the EU. Bureaucratic chaos resulting from Brexit means they have been unable to sell to their usual markets and their boats are currently tied up. Logistics firms will not accept any more catch because of the current customs chaos. The situation is similar across much of Scotland and the UK.</p>



<p>During this week&#8217;s Committee for the Future Relationship with the EU public evidence session, I highlighted these issues to representatives from relevant stakeholders: Make UK, the British Retail Consortium and the Food and Drink Federation.</p>

<p>I also asked the UK Secretary of State for Environmental, Farming and Rural Affairs what financial support the UK Government would provide to this struggling industry and how he planned to the resolve issues he previously described as &#8216;teething problems&#8217;.</p>

<p>Far from promises of a &#8216;sea of opportunity&#8217; and &#8216;taking back control&#8217;, the stark realities of Brexit are being felt hard by fishing communities in Central Ayrshire and beyond.</p>



<h2>Dr Philippa Whitford MP</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Eight-five per cent. of the seafood caught by my local fishing fleet goes to customers in the EU. Along with boats right across the UK, they are currently tied up, as logistics firms will not accept any more produce due to the current customs chaos. </p><p>Can the Secretary of State explain how he plans to resolve what he dismisses as “teething problems” and clarify what the Prime Minister meant when he talked about financial compensation for their losses?</p></blockquote>



<h2>George Eustice</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are working closely with the industry and DFDS to identify what we can do to address some of the problems that have been encountered. </p><p>I am aware that late last week, DFDS suspended the groupage service that it was offering to smaller consignments and has focused on single larger consignments, particularly of Scottish salmon. I understand that it believes it has sorted out some of those problems and intends next week to resume some of those groupage consignments. </p><p>There is a challenge here: in a group of several consignments, maybe three people would have got the paperwork right, but if one person has not, that can cause issues for everybody. We need people to pay attention to the detail and to get that paperwork right. We are working closely with the industry so that it can acclimatise itself to this administrative process.</p></blockquote>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>I wish you all a good and perhaps most importantly, a healthy New Year. This year begins with a shared goal; for us, all to get through it safely together. As with every new year, it is also a time to think ahead to what we want for the future.</p>
<p>We know our villages, towns and the city centre will be different and that now is the time to reflect on how we want to live and treat people locally in the future. The world has changed, and although the fabric that holds our communities together is stronger than ever, we have learned that what was paramount yesterday could now be a barrier to progress. While there are new and exciting endeavours that need our support, existing challenges outside the pandemic bubble remain pressing – globally, nationally and locally.</p>
<p>There is still a climate emergency, and we still need to provide a place fit for people of all ages, for the 21st Century. Finding a way to bring all of this together into a cohesive plan involving the most impacted people has to be a collective, local priority. I am already reaching out to businesses, community groups, charities and a wide range of organisations to work towards this common goal.</p>
<p>The new, more contagious strain of the virus has pushed back many people&#8217;s hopes and expectations for the early months of 2021. Of course, this is hard to take, especially for those whose jobs or livelihoods are affected directly by the lockdown. My team and I continue to support hundreds of families and businesses going through extreme hardship; for them right now, it&#8217;s hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>While this new strain is a setback, it is not the virus winning; we can get through this—rapid deployment of the vaccine underway. As hard as it is, we need to keep the faith, hunker down, stay home, go out for only essential purposes or exercise and keep out of other homes unless included in a specifically identified exemption.</p>
<p>It is true that because of our efforts to follow the rules, rates of infection here have been lower, but we also now face rising numbers of infections fuelled by mixing over the festive period. A reminder of just how vulnerable we all are and how quickly our fortunes can change. Please keep staying at home.</p><p><br></p>

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>

<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

<p>Last week I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate entitled <strong>Future of fairs and Showgrounds</strong>. I wanted to support those showmen and women here in South Shields which has a long history of welcoming traveling showmen and women that dates back almost 100 years. It is imperative that the Government stops ignoring the fairground and showmen community and steps in to provide vital support before it is too late. As a longstanding supporter and advocate for show people and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fairs and Showgrounds, I will continue to be a voice for this community and press the Government at every opportunity for better support and recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the outset of the pandemic, many fairs were either cancelled or postponed – from summer fetes to Christmas Markets. As a result of the closures and postponing of fairs, many show people suffered huge financial loss, plunging them into financial insecurity.</p>



<p>The heart of the issue is that the financial support offered to the tourism industry during COVID-19 continually excluded the fairground community. Showmen and women also did not qualify for the assistance announced in the recent budget for retail, leisure and hospitality firms relating to business rates in the coming year, due to the way that the Show people operate, which falls outside the scope of static leisure providers.</p>



<p>Show people across the UK and particularly those here in South Shields, now face losing their businesses and livelihoods if the UK Government does not step in.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br />
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br />
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br />
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br />
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br />
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br />
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br />
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br />
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
