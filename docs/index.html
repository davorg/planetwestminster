<p>China has decided to suspend her not very demanding emissions targets as the country needs to keep the lights on. In a major reversal just before COP 26 the world&#8217;s largest producer of CO2 has had to urge full out production and purchase of coal to generate power. Any idea that the creator of 27% of the world&#8217;s manmade CO2 was about to reverse the growth in her carbon output has been forced out by the reality that she needs coal to keep the factories turning and the homes heated and functioning. In Germany the CDU is trying to keep coal alive until 2038, with the CDU government in the Rhineland approving new large strip mining activities, owing to the unreliability of wind power on the German system.</p>
<p>Governments keen to decarbonise need to recognise that their prime duty is to keep the lights on and the factories working. It is not a good look  to end up with emergency power cuts and the need to dash for coal to avoid disaster. Our very sophisticated societies, hospitals, schools  and homes rely completely on electricity to power them or to operate the controls, lighting  and communications. It is even more important now to have enough capacity for all conditions and eventualities.</p>
<p>I repeat my request of government that they make putting in more electricity capacity an urgent priority, choosing methods of generation that balance the current mix and provide resilience. I also want to see us produce more domestic gas and biomass materials to cut the costs and fuel use currently taken by importing LNG and wood pellet and to add to our options for power generation.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>Philip Dunne MP last week visited a local GP practice to hear more about the booster vaccine rollout in South East Shropshire, and to thank GPs and staff for their efforts to keep the community healthy. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne met local GP Dr Jess Harvey, who is helping coordinate the vaccination programme for South East Shropshire, at the Much Wenlock & Cressage surgery. They discussed the rollout of covid booster jabs, but also the way in which local GPs are responding to significant demand for regular services. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: </span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>“I was pleased to meet Dr Harvey, to talk through the booster programme for South East Shropshire, which is due to commence this coming week for the most vulnerable groups. The rollout of the first two doses has been extremely successful, with over 90% of people over 18 in Shropshire having had at least one dose, and 85.4% have had both doses. In a helpful change for local residents, booster vaccinations from South East Shropshire GPs will be delivered at local practices, rather than patients being required to travel to a central hub at Bridgnorth. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“</span></span></span><span><span><span>We also discussed the huge workload all GP practices are facing with the backlog created by the pandemic. I am pleased to see all GP surgeries offering face to face appointments, but these are quite properly being triaged by an initial telephone call or email appointment. This helps clinicians have consultations with as many patients as possible each day. It also allows many patients to resolve their issue without the need for a physical appointment. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“</span></span></span><span><span><span>I saw for myself the very high case load being seen to by the dedicated team at the Much Wenlock & Cressage practice, and was pleased to be able to thank them, and their colleagues across South Shropshire, for what they are doing to keep local residents healthy, in what has been a second stressful year for healthcare professionals on the frontline in responding to the pandemic.”</span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span>The public should not contact the NHS, including their GP Practice, for a booster vaccination, but instead should wait to be contacted by their GP. Those 12-15 year olds being home schooled or excluded will receive confirmation of how to access vaccination clinics shortly.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne’s visit occurred prior to his displaying any symptoms for Covid19. He has since tested positive, and is currently undertaking self-isolation due to end next week. </span></span></span></p></div>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Stockport’s Statement of Case published this week the Council have been very clear that the destruction of the Tame Valley can in no way be justified by the ‘very special circumstances’ Quorum claim to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Specifically the Statement says <span style="color: #808080;"><em>“</em><em>the very special circumstances necessary to justify the development do not exist. The need and Green Belt location for the development as a whole has not been robustly demonstrated, and therefore the development by definition is harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved</em><em>.”</em></span></strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Andrew Gwynne MP said:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">“This is a very important first step in the appeals process and a significant victory to ensure our beautiful greenbelt is protected. I am delighted that Stockport Council is standing with the residents living nearby who overwhelmingly oppose this greenbelt destruction. I would like to thank the Councillors and Officers in Stockport for taking this position and putting the health and wellbeing of both Stockport and Denton residents first.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Gwynne continued:</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">“However this fight is not over yet, and won’t be until the appeal is refused by the Planning Inspectorate. The Councillors and I will fight tooth and nail until this proposal is dead and buried.”</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Councillor Claire Reid added</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">“we still have a long way to go in this process, but for Stockport Council to come out so strongly against the appeal really is the best possible start we could have had.  We will let everyone know as soon as the date for the planning appeal is announced, and of continue to keep residents updated every step of the way.”</span></p></blockquote>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Inverness is gearing up for the launch of HI-BIKE, the new electric bike share scheme being introduced in the city. The first phase of the scheme will see 30 electric bikes being made available for hire in the city, with three docking stations located at:-</p>
<ul>
<li>The Railway Station (near its entrance to Falcon Square)</li>
<li>The Lochan, Inverness Campus, Beechwood</li>
<li>Great Glen House, Leachkin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Promoting the scheme is HITRANS, the regional transport partnership for the Highlands and Islands, which is working in partnership with The Highland Council to expand the scheme over the next 12 months to bring additional bikes and docking stations to the city, giving a wider geographic spread and providing access to the bikes from more residential areas.</p>
<p>HI-BIKE offers a range of membership options, from pay per ride to monthly or yearly membership.  Shorter membership options include 30 minutes free riding before extra time fees kick in, and monthly and yearly membership gives 45 minutes free each ride. To use the service, users can simply purchase a membership online or using the Hi-Bike mobile app. More information is available on the website: <a href="http://www.hi-bike.co.uk">www.hi-bike.co.uk</a></p>
<p>HITRANS Partnership Chair, Highland Councillor Allan Henderson, said: “HI-BIKE gives residents and visitors more options for making shorter journeys within the city by bike, helping to reduce carbon emissions and pollution, and improving health and wellbeing.”</p>
<p>This is an eagerly-awaited project that will give people the opportunity to travel around the city in a different way, enjoy the benefits of active travel and play their part in protecting our environment. I’m looking forward to the rollout of the scheme across Inverness, confirming its position as a major cycling city, and to other communities in the Highlands.</p>

              <h3>Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil met with representatives from Western Isles Citizens Advice Service (WICAS) this week to discuss the impact of the cut to Universal Credit uplift on island claimants.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has already written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Riki Sunak MP urging the UK Government to retain the £20 uplift which has been a lifeline to more than 1,500 people in the Western Isles who have been claiming Universal Credit throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p>He also supported an Opposition Day Parliamentary Motion to cancel the cut, which was backed, but will not, unfortunately, prevent the UK Government from going ahead with the cut.</p>



<p>He said: “This week’s meeting with representatives from WICAS was extremely helpful in identifying the real daily impact that this cut will have on people who are already struggling financially. It is not right that so many people are kept on the edge of financial stress due to warped Tory money ideology.&nbsp; The physical, mental and social well-being of too many people is impacted by the UK Government&#8217;s policy of keeping people in poverty.</p>



<p>“The whole WICAS team work extremely hard to provide key support and advice to those most in need.&nbsp; They have also helped to bring in an incredible total of at least £870,000 to the Western Isles economy in the last year, a figure with a likely high multiplier effect.</p>



<p>“The team tell me that money is the main issue being raised with them by members of the community and the UK Government is about to make this worse.</p>



<p>“I will continue to press the UK Government to retain the uplift, although it seems unlikely they will back down.”</p>



<p>Hector Macleod, Western Isles Citizens Advice Service (WICAS) said: “WICAS are currently dealing with a sharp increase in contact from individuals with debt related issues, and are braced for a further wave of calls from clients when the £20 uplift of Universal Credit is withdrawn at the end of September.</p>



<p>“By the very nature of the uplift and subsequent withdrawal of this additional benefit, it will be the poorest in our society who will be affected most. WICAS call on all elected representatives to lobby the Government, and ask them to reconsider the removal of this crucial support and consider the impact on those most affected.”</p>



<p>In August 2021 there were 1,530 people on Universal Credit in Na h-Eileanan an Iar. 9.6% of the working-age population of the constituency (those aged 16-65).</p>



<p>In July, 632 people on Universal Credit in Na h-Eileanan an Iar were in employment, 41.3% of the total number on UC in the constituency.</p>



<p>The SNP have repeatedly called on the UK to make the uplift to Universal Credit and Working Tax Credits permanent and to extend an equivalent uplift to people claiming legacy benefits such as Employment and Support Allowance and Jobseekers Allowance.</p>



<p>The UK Government confirmed the uplift to Universal Credit will be withdrawn at the end of September, just as the furlough scheme ends, and the OBR expects UK unemployment levels to peak.</p>

Once she found a setting, she had to become qualified to be able to run the group, so attended afternoon sessions in childcare to get her qualifications. 50 years on and Sue Allen (who has managed the school for the past four years but worked there for many more) has also seen her own children attend the school.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Some of Sue’s favourite memories over the years include celebrating Prince William and The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton’s wedding - inviting all the parents and staff for the occasion. Other cherished memories include their yearly sports day for all the families to enjoy and regularly taking older children to an end of year outing as they come to the end of their time at the pre-school.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sue’s plans for Chandlers Chatters are to continue the high level of care and support they provide at the pre-school so the children can continue to thrive. Sue also aims to improve the group wherever she can, so the children have the best start in life feeling safe and secure in the group’s environment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The group are always happy to except toys but are limited to space as they are a ‘pack away’ setting. The pre-school receive help with paper form a local company in Ferry lane, Rainham which is a big help.  Most of the children who come through to the setting come through recommendation and most children's names are put down from birth. They also, always have a very long waiting list.  Parsonage Farm School who are Chandlers Chatters ‘feeder school’ also recommend the pre-school.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If you would like to find out more about this wonderful, community pre-school you can contact the setting in the following ways:</p><p class="MsoNormal">Phone: 01708 551233 / 07494 301024</p><p class="MsoNormal">Email: <a href="mailto:sue@chandlerschatters.co.uk">sue@chandlerschatters.co.uk</a></p><p>Address: The Brenda Blakemore Community Centre, Davies Close, Rainham, Essex, RM13 9LJ</p></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-2 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden clearfix"><ul class="links"><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-0"><a href="/tags/rainham" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Rainham</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-1"><a href="/tags/education" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Education</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-2"><a href="/tags/community-focus" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Community Focus</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-3"><a href="/tags/children" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Children</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-4"><a href="/tags/childrens-group" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Children&#039;s Group</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-5"><a href="/tags/activities" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Activities</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-6"><a href="/tags/anniversary" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Anniversary</a></li><li class="taxonomy-term-reference-7"><a href="/tags/chandlers-chatters" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype="">Chandlers Chatters</a></li></ul></div>

<p>Greetings from the Labour Party in Brighton.</p>



<p>At Labour conferences, there are those who want to win elections and those who love opposition and do their best to embarrass the leadership, a bit like having a few hundred grumpy aunts and uncles, sitting in the corner, upsetting your family and friends.</p>



<p>The Tories often stage manage their events much better although who can forget the year the letters fell from Theresa May&#8217;s backdrop, a portent of disasters to follow if ever I saw one.</p>



<p>Shadow Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has set the tone for Labour with ambitious but affordable plans to help business recover and create jobs in a new green economy.</p>



<p>We have to be careful about revealing too many good ideas, too soon.</p>



<p>Remember when we announced plans for an energy cap. It was immediately denounced by the Tories and then quietly adopted and is now the cornerstone of this government&#8217;s efforts to control energy price rises.</p>



<p>Right now, our country is struggling to overcome the ravages of the pandemic and a spate of petrol, gas and food shortages. The government insists it&#8217;s not their fault, but what&#8217;s the point of government if it can&#8217;t sort these things?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s good that they&#8217;ve borrowed Labour&#8217;s suggestions for temporary visas to address shortages of HGV drivers but a pity they didn&#8217;t do it a year ago when we first suggested it. That might have spared us some of the current misery.</p>



<p>Keir Starmer has shown this week that he&#8217;s in charge of Labour and has a team with the ideas and energy ready to take over if the Conservatives continue to mess up.</p>



<p>Shortly the stage will move to their conference in Manchester.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s hope there&#8217;s enough petrol to get them there and that the restaurants and bars don&#8217;t run out of chicken or red wine.</p>



<p>After almost 12 years in power, they&#8217;re finding it harder to blame others for the country&#8217;s problems. No doubt we&#8217;ll hear a lot of rubbishing of Labour ideas but watch how quickly some of them will magically be rebranded as Conservative ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Emails from Constituent raising HGV driver shortage and lack of help to obtain a HGV License:</strong></p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: re HGV training</p>
<p>Thanks for your considered reply. I have spoke with the DWP on a few occasions and they will only offer funding when a job offer is in place. I contacted them again today after reading your reply.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no question that there is a skills shortage in this area, which has been confirmed by each HGV firm I have spoken to. I also linked to last weeks article in the Guardian which outlined the shortage of drivers (class 1) currently in the UK.</p>
<p>However the DWP need a job offer in writing before any potential funding would be released, for which, I would firstly need my licence.  Catch 22.</p>
<p>This I understood already. However, I&#8217;m convinced that someone, somewhere, DWP or otherwise, has access to or knowledge of funding for non vocational training. It&#8217;s just not discussed, advertised and has been placed in a black box to sit on an obscure shelf away from the public gaze.</p>
<p>For that reason, I thank you for your enquiry directed to the DM and I will continue to search for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> HGV Question.</p>
<p>Hi Chi,</p>
<p>As my local MP, would you know of any any funding available that will help me to take an HGV class 1 course here in the North East.? It seems quite pertinent at the moment, having just read this article in the Daily Mail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3002399/Emergency-funding-used-train-thousands-lorry-drivers-prevent-food-shortages.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3002399/Emergency-funding-used-train-thousands-lorry-drivers-prevent-food-shortages.html</a></p>
<p>I have a HGV cat C licence, but understand that there is a big shortage of Cat C+E (articulated HGV) drivers nationally. The barrier is the £1500 cost of the training course plus the CPC requirement.</p>
<p>I have approached a few local firms to enquire about any in house or part funding available, as well as the DWP along with an extensive internet search, but with no success. I’ve managed to save £300 so far and continue to add to this small pot slowly each month. But its tough!</p>
<p>I was hoping you may be able to sign post me or offer any inside advice about possible funding for this area, that may be in the pipeline or difficult to otherwise source.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>YYYYYYYYYY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the House of Commons Chamber <u>on Monday evening</u> the UK Government proposed an “Instruction Motion” to amend the Elections Bill which is at its Committee Stage of the House of Commons. The amendment would broaden the scope of the Elections Bill to include provision for a simple majority voting system for the following elections: the Mayor of London; an elected Mayor in England Local Authorities; a Mayor in a Combined Authority; and Police and Crime Commissioners. The Minister who was taking this Bill through the House has been promoted in the PM’s recent reshuffle, so the Minister of State for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Local Communities Christopher Pincher moved the motion and set out the reasons for amending the scope of the Bill. He said that the Conservative Manifesto had committed to first past the post and was the majority view (67%) of the British people in the 2011 Referendum. The Labour Spokesperson Cat Smith MP, Leicester and Fleetwood, stated that the Bill had already started, Second Reading has debated the merits or otherwise of the contents of the Bill, and the Committee has already finished taking evidence. As a member of the Panel of Chairs I chaired the evidence sessions, and Cat Smith raised a Point of Order at the final evidence session last week when she saw the Instruction Motion had been added to this week’s Order Paper. Cat asked me whether we could take evidence on electoral systems at that session and I was clear that it was out of the scope of the existing Bill. But should the Instruction be accepted and the scope of the Bill widened, then extra evidence sessions would not be a matter for the Chair, because matters such as this are decided through the usual channels (Government and Opposition Whips). Cat also asked Mr Pincher during the debate why the UK Government had not put this in the Bill from the start, allowing members to scrutinise it on Second Reading and in Committee. Cat also stated that it was in the UK Government’s Conservative 2017 Manifesto but not in the 2019 version, and that the Bill started under the Cabinet Office, but it has been moved to the newly renamed “Department for Levelling Up”. Cat said that the motion stinks of gerrymandering and Labour will be voting against it. The UK Government won the division by 309 to 186 votes. As a chair of the Bill, I am not permitted to vote on the Bill, but I would certainly have voted against the U.K. Government Instruction for the reasons set out by Cat.</p>
<p>Later that evening I attended a celebration in the House of Lords for the GB athletes who had taken part in the Olympics and Paralympics. Parliamentarians had the opportunity to meet the athletes and congratulate them on their wonderful performances at the Tokyo Olympic Games. I met my old friend Tanni Grey-Thompson who was speaking at the event and we had a chance to catch up on various aspects of UK sport, because we haven’t seen one another since pre-pandemic times. Tanni and I share a passion for sport. My dear friend Sue’s grandson Owain Lloyd-Hughes aged 19, was there. Owain is a 100/200 metres runner and a member of Neath Harriers Amateur Athletic Club, and is aiming to be part of the Commonwealth Games Relay Team, but has been suffering with an injury. We wish him a speedy recovery in time for the indoor athletic season.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I chaired the first joint meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Sport and the APPG for the Olympics and Paralympics, of which I am a Vice-Chair. The title of the meeting was “Beyond Tokyo – Securing a Sustainable Future for Local Sport and Leisure Facilities”, hosted by the Sport and Recreation Alliance, the secretariat for the APPG Sport, with guest speakers: Lord Colin Moynihan, Co-chair of APPG Olympics and Paralympics, Vice-chair of APPG Sport, Chair of the British Olympic Association 2005-12, and former rowing Olympic silver medalist at Moscow 1980; Cllr Gerald Vernon-Jackson Liberal Democrat Leader of Portsmouth Council, Chair of Local Government Association Culture, Tourism and Sport Board; and Huw Edwards, Chief Executive Officer Ukactive since 2019, Leisure Sector Champion 2017, and worked for the Olympic Delivery Authority for the London Olympics. Over 35 sport sector agencies joined in the Zoom event and had the opportunity to question the speakers. The speakers found common ground on the need to have increased funding, updated leisure facilities because most Local Authority centres were built in the 1970’s, and that the health and well-being of participating in sport and leisure activities is known to prevent physical and mental illness. Also that the lack of statutory provision for leisure at local government level means that in these times of UK Government cuts, the delivery of social services and looked-after children services would always be ahead of leisure in local government. And that women, people on low income, and ethnic minorities are reluctant to take part in leisure, which is a challenge to everyone involved in delivering leisure facilities at whatever level. But grassroots sport is so important in that it encourages participation and forms the base of the pyramid for international participation. Lord Moynihan was concerned at the lack of joined up thinking across UK Government departments because leisure straddles sport, health, education, local government and there should be a common strategy, and the Lords often succeed in implementing change because they work on a cross-party basis, whereas in the Commons, the UK Government has such a large majority that it is able to implement its legislation without amendments. The opposition can provide scrutiny but is unable to prevent U.K. Government proposals becoming legislation.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday the UK Government granted Labour an Opposition Day debate, and we laid a motion entitled “Finances of Working People: Government Policy”. Labour Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson MP, Houghton and Sunderland South, spoke about the growing squeeze on living standards caused by the £1040 per year reduction to Universal Credit, the rise in National Insurance Contributions for low and middle income workers, the freezing of the personal income tax allowance from April 2022, the increasing cost of household energy bills, the highest petrol prices since 2013 with the potential for the highest rail fare increase in a decade, the fastest rise in private rental costs since 2008, successive above inflation increases in childcare costs, and rising prices resulting from the supply chain disruptions caused by worker and supply shortages, and she called on the UK Government to change its direction on its policies, because they have created an avoidable and unacceptable burden on working people. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mims Davies MP, Eastleigh, responded by stating that during the pandemic the UK Government stepped in to pay the wages of millions of workers, investing over £400 billion in jobs packages, protecting jobs and safeguarding livelihoods, including kickstart, restart, doubling work coaches, job entry support, job finding support, sector-based work academy programmes, an enhanced youth offer, expansion of the job centre network, assisting claimants with benefits, and harnessing skills in a new way. She said that measures were temporary and now public health restrictions have been relaxed, this support must end. Her message to everyone in the chamber and beyond was “if you want to progress in the jobs market, whoever you are, wherever you are – at any age or any stage – we are here for you. We will get behind you.” I’m sorry, but I don’t think the UK Government live in the real world. Unfortunately we lost the vote on our motion by 222 to 300 votes.</p>
<p><u>On Wednesday morning</u> as Vice-Chair of the APPG for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) I joined an officers meeting convened by the chair, Chris Bryant MP, Rhondda, to discuss his Private Members’ Bill (PMB) on Acquired Brain Injury scheduled for <u>Friday 3rd December</u>. Chris has been campaigning to raise awareness of ABI for many years, and has cross Party support for this very important condition. However, as with nearly every opposition PMB, it will require UK Government support to make it to the next stage. Our APPG has written many letters to UK Government Ministers and the Prime Minister seeking support, but to date, we have only received warm words. But we shall keep fighting for justice for ABI sufferers.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson was in the US, so this week’s Prime Minister’s Questions was between the Deputy PM, Dominic Raab, and our own Deputy Leader Angela Rayner, who began by raising the lack of progress being made by the PM n Washington before testing the Deputy PM’s fuse by asking him whether he still thinks that British workers are “the worst idlers in the world”. Angela asked how many days a minimum-wage worker would have to work to afford one night in a luxury hotel in Crete, somewhere not unfamiliar to Mr Raab. The answer is 50 days, but this is without the financial burdens already imposed on working families due to the UK Government policies of £1040 cut to Universal Credit, rising rent costs, soaring food prices, tax increases and the impending energy crisis. Families are faced with choosing to put food on the table, or heat their homes. Angela asked the UK Tory Government to cancel its cut to Universal Credit. I bobbed from the back benches throughout PMQs in the hope that Mr Speaker would call me to ask a question, but alas it didn’t happen.</p>
<p><u>On Friday morning</u> I joined the regular update Zoom call with SBUHB for Swansea Region MPs/MSs to listen to the <a href="https://sbuhb.nhs.wales/coronavirus-covid-19/information/vaccine-in-swansea-and-npt/vaccination-newsletters/">latest report</a> of the pandemic situation in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot. I can not imagine the extreme pressure that NHS and social care staff must be under. NPT has the highest rates of coronavirus in the UK. The rates of infection are increasing, hospital admissions are increasing, there are very high rates in schools, pupils are taking it home and it is spreading throughout the community. The vaccination programme has been successful and it is this that has prevented the rates being much higher. But people who have been double jabbed are still at risk of being infected because the Delta variant is so infectious, so other mitigating actions, such as social distancing and mask wearing indoors, regular hand washing, sanitising, must be maintained. SBUHB are rolling out the booster vaccination programme and flu jabs, plus vaccinations for 12-15 year olds have started. I thank all the NHS staff and volunteers from the bottom of my heart for working tirelessly to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Later that morning I hosted a McMillan Coffee Morning in Dove Workshop, Banwen, and I want to thank Lesley, Julie and Ellie for all their support organising it, and for Lesley’s wonderful homemade cheese scones! The event was well-attended and I’m pleased to say we raised a fantastic £86 for the Macmillan charity. It was fantastic to be out and about once more in the community and to be chatting with people face to face. Macmillan Coffee Mornings are such a wonderful idea – not only do they raise awareness of the realities of cancer and raise money for the cancer nurses whose work is so vital, but they also allow people the chance to really talk about cancer and any concerns they themselves may have – memories of family and friends who have been ill with cancer and the impact that cancer has on a wide network of people. Thank you so much to everyone who came, to Dove Workshop for hosting us, and to Macmillan for the sterling work that they do day in, day out.</p>
<p>I also met lots of residents at the McMillan Coffee Morning organised by Sacha, Hannah, and Maerdy Youth, hosted by Cllr Sonia Reynolds which took place in Canolfan Maerdy, Tairgwaith, which was also visited by former MS Gwenda Thomas and Cllr Arwyn Woolcock.</p>
<p>As part of the Great Big Green Week celebrations I dropped in to the Friends and Neighbours Community Alliance (FAN) event. FAN was started by Emma Knight when she moved to live in Ethel Street in 2008, and organised a fancy dress Halloween Street Party. Over 50 people turned up and enjoyed themselves so much that FAN was formed by volunteers for the benefit of the community. There is also a junior arm called Mini FANS. Events such as fitness for the elderly, drumming workshops, circus groups, street cleans, and raffles have taken place. FAN has created a community garden growing herbs, vegetables and fruit, with a greenhouse made from plastic bottles. FAN has also organised WWF Earth Hour, Fair-trade events, and is committed to going green, zero carbon, and other climate change measures, for our next generation.</p>
<p>I know that there are many constituents who are concerned about the threat of a rise in energy prices. A basic duty of government is to ensure secure and affordable energy supplies for households and businesses. But millions of families are now set to be squeezed by a triple whammy of rising energy prices, an increase in national insurance, and the cut to Universal Credit. This UK Tory Government has no idea what it is like for working people outside of their bubble where they’ve never had to worry about paying the rent, or meeting the cost of a new school year’s uniform, or watching the forecast to try to ration out heating. Hard-working families are being punished by this UK Government after a decade of austerity and a decade of a complete lack of interest in or care about those struggling to get by on the lowest of pay. That is why Labour is calling for the Government to change course and cancel the cut, drop the jobs tax hike on working people and businesses, and urgently explore further measures to help households alleviate the cost of rising bills, including the option of making automatic and extending the Warm Homes Discount. Pushing more people into poverty, widening health inequalities with ill-heated homes and not enough money for good food is not going to help the economy recover; it will simply mean greater pressures on the NHS and greater pressures on social services.</p>

<p>I was pleased to be on the panel at the launch of the No Place Left Behind report from the Commission on Prosperity and Community Placeholding on Monday, where we discussed the importance of giving communities new powers in efforts to ‘level up’ left behind neighbourhoods. Top-down projects rarely work because their leaders simply cannot understand the specific needs of local communities and cannot implement effective tools to enact change. The importance of local knowledge and lived experience should not be underestimated. I found it striking that the report noted how important it was for people to live within a short distance of good quality shops for groceries and that this can boost the wellbeing of constituents. In order for this to happen, we need to look at business rates and ensure that in poorer parts of the country, we are not hindering growth before it can even begin by placing shop premises financially out of reach for local sellers.  I look forward to continuing these discussions.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I was able to put a question to the Home Office Minister on the epidemic we are facing of violence against women and girls. I agreed with the recent police report recommendation that violence against women and girls be treated with the same degree of importance as countering terrorism. Resources are a huge factor in this. We cannot expect police to fight this epidemic with the paltry resources that they currently have at their disposal. If this Government are serious about countering violence against women and girls, then they need to give the police have the tools to do the job. The Home Office must ensure that there is a national programme to tackle this and that local forces are not simply left to deal with this epidemic of violence themselves. </p>
<p>It’s once again been a busy week on the Committee for the Health Bill. We’ve been looking at transparency and independent scrutiny of local services. It is so important that patients can see where money is being spent in their local health services and how decisions about provision are being made.  For that to be the case, there must be independent scrutiny with access to the appropriate information and the ability to challenge decisions that are at odds with the needs of the community. The NHS faces many challenges, but more transparency will help us identify areas of difficulty and implement the necessary change to make improvements. </p>
<p>We have also been looking at the important issue of workforce planning and the importance of training local people. Fairly recently, the Government expanded medical training places in parts of the country where there is a low take-up, and to which people are not moving to work. We know that if we train people locally, they stay local and if the Government would like a quick and easy way to level up—however they want to define it—that is it. If we want our young people to stay in their local areas to work, we need to offer them the jobs and training that enable them to do so. It’s not fair that for young people to get a job they have to move away from their homes, their families, and their friends. It’s also not fair on their local communities who lose that talent and youthful enthusiasm! We need healthcare workers within our communities but that only happens when we offer the training and provide the jobs to build that care within the community. </p>
<p>I have introduced an amendment to the Bill on end-of-life care which we discussed this week. As someone with a longstanding interest in this issue, I believe that this Bill must make provision for anyone with a terminal illness diagnosis to be offered a conversation about what the diagnosis means to them and how the health service can support them at the end of their life.  At this point, a patient’s needs are not merely medical, so the conversation needs to include support on understanding and deciding on their treatment, on support for their mental wellbeing, financial and practical support to ensure that they are prepared, and support with their social relationships. These conversations are by nature incredibly difficult, but they are also necessary. Healthcare does not stop because medicine can not save us and clear guidance on what this means is vital to ensure that all patients are treated with respect and dignity until the end. </p>
<p>I was pleased to join the Advanced Construction Skills Centre launch today with the Mayor of the West of England, Dan Norris. The £9 million investment in this Skills Centre is a wonderful opportunity for the young people in South Bristol and I am pleased that higher apprenticeship courses will be offered alongside construction courses for trades in wood, brick, and plaster for both young people and those looking to retrain or build on their current qualifications. We need centres like this around the country to develop our vocational capacity, to provide young people with the trades and skills that will help them into well paid jobs, and to show a commitment to ensuring that learning a trade is given the same level of investment and respect as learning in an academic setting. Both are vital for the prosperity of this country and both are needed to help our towns and communities recover from a decade of austerity and the pandemic. </p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Last night Preet Kaur Gill MP, the Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for British Sikhs hosted a parliamentary reception with the kind permission of the Speaker, the Rt. Hon. Sir Lindsay Hoyle MP in Speaker’s House at the Palace of Westminster.</p>
<p>This historic cross-party event was to reflect on Anglo-Sikh history and explore issues connected to British Sikhs today. The Speaker welcomed parliamentarians, prestigious guests and leaders of the Sikh community in the State Rooms in the Speaker’s House.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP and Dabinderjit Singh OBE, the principal adviser of the Sikh Federation (UK) reflected on key moments from throughout Anglo-Sikh history over the last 200 years.</p>
<p>Gurpreet Singh Anand, the President of the first Sikh Gurdwara (Central Gurdwara, London) established in 1911 and the current Secretary General of the Sikh Council UK and Balvinder Kaur Saund the Chair of the Sikh Women’s Alliance spoke about issues both connected to and connecting British Sikhs today.</p>
<p>Politicians who spoke at the event also included:</p>
<p>·       Tom Tugendhat MP, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee</p>
<p>·       Kate Green MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Education</p>
<p>·       Joy Morrissey MP, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)</p>
<p>·       Martin Docherty-Hughes MP</p>
<p>·       Pat McFadden MP</p>
<p>Coinciding with Saragarhi Day as well as the 20th anniversary of 9/11, speakers touched on both the present day and historic contributions and challenges facing the Sikh community. Preet Kaur Gill MP reflected on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, for whom British Sikhs have been the target of hate crime and prejudice in the aftermath, as well as the sacrifice of 21 Sikh soldiers in the battle of Saragarhi in 1897. She and Tom Tugendhat MP discussed the Hidden Heroes campaign which they have championed with We Too Built Britain.</p>
<p>MPs both recognised the enormous contribution of Sikhs to Great Britain, as well as the sacrifice and hardship Sikhs have faced over the decades. MPs took the opportunity to celebrate how over the last 200 years, Britain’s military officials and political leaders have appreciated and promoted the Sikh identity.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP, the host and Chair of the APPG for British Sikhs said: “It is a great honour to have held this event in Speaker’s House, to gather community leaders and Parliamentarians to celebrate British Sikh heritage and reflect on the issues affecting our communities today.</p>
<p>Sikh history is British history.  To move forward it is important to acknowledge and understand the historic injustices and challenges Sikhs have faced while building on the great successes in Anglo-Sikh history over the past 200 years. That starts with open engagement and an honest reckoning with our country’s past.</p>
<p>Across the globe, Governments should appreciate the enormous contribution Sikhs make to the world, working in collaboration with them to realise their ethos for the betterment of all.”</p>

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong>In her <a href="https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/19565264.bradford-south-mp-judith-cummins-lots-words---little-credible-action-government/">latest editorial in the Telegraph &amp; Argus</a>, Judith talks about her recent work on a range of important local and national issues:</strong></p>



<p>I hope that people have managed to get a break during the summer. Over the summer months we saw terrible events unfold in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is an international crisis which the government needs to lead the national response to. The withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan has left many people in fear of their lives from Taliban reprisals. The government has a moral responsibility to play its part in defending those Afghans who are in the greatest danger from the Taliban.</p>



<p>This situation requires a national response; it should not be left up to local authorities across the country to volunteer to support those escaping from the new Afghan regime. The Government must lead a coordinated and well-resourced plan that disperses those seeking refuge from Taliban across the United Kingdom in a fair way. I expect Bradford to play its full part in this. But I also expect every other council to do the same, and for the government to fully fund any resettlement program.</p>



<p>The Government have given us lots of words at present but very little credible action as to how they are going to do this and also how they plan to bring British nationals that are still stranded in Afghanistan home. This must be their immediate priority.</p>



<p>The Government should have acted to improve Social Care over a decade ago. The delaying of taking decisive action has left social care in a crisis with services grossly underfunded and understaffed – something that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated. However, rather than leading a national debate on what care services should look like in the future, the government is rushing through a manifesto-breaking raise to National Insurance. This is not a plan to tackle the crisis in social care, it is just an unfair tax rise.</p>



<p>We are all in agreement that Social Care needs extra funding, but there are fairer ways that this money can be raised. The government should be considering introducing new income tax brackets that ensure that those with the broadest shoulders pay their fair share of the social care bill, instead the current government proposals will mean that lower paid people across my Bradford South constituency will instead be worse off. Fundamentally, we need a fair and equal plan to fund our Social Care services not one that will seemingly mean that the rich stay rich, but the poor become poorer.</p>



<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and increased many of the inequalities and challenges faced by employees such as low-pay, insecure work, and insufficient working hours. As we move forward, we now need to look at addressing these issues as it’s simply not good enough to go back to the pre-Covid ‘normal’ of a deregulated labour market, we need to create a new way of working that is fairer for all.</p>



<p>The government commissioned a report into this issue in 2017, but as is typical of the current Government – it has still has not implemented any of the report.</p>



<p>People in Bradford South, and right across the country, need strong legislation to bolster employment protections in the post-Covid world.  I will be strongly advocating for this as we continue to emerge from the pandemic.</p>



<p>As big national and international issues dominate the headlines, here at home in Bradford there are many local nuisances that gravely impact on people’s lives.</p>



<p>As we approach bonfire night the issue of fireworks disturbances after dark will become an even greater annoyance. Although unfortunately this is an issue that sadly plagues many people all year round.</p>



<p>Using a firework after 11pm is an offence under the Fireworks Act 2003. There are various ways in which police can deal with this and I will be ensuring that the council and the police must make full use of the current powers that they have at their disposal.</p>



<p>However, it is clear to me that the legislation around fireworks needs to be improved and that is why I am planning to call for a debate in Parliament to challenge the government to do more to help my constituents live in a less noisy and safer environment.</p>



<p>Before the summer recess, I challenged the Government in parliament to tackle the issues surrounding&nbsp;quad&nbsp;bike use, with a view to exploring the banning of&nbsp;quad&nbsp;bikes for on–road use. I speak with many local residents who have concerns that quad&nbsp;bikes driving up and down our roads, and sometimes pavements, in an anti-social manner often with face coverings and no licence plates.</p>



<p>As the Government have no current plans to introduce legislation on this serious issue. I will continue to work to ensure this issue gets the attention from Government it deserves. Local people shouldn’t have to put up with this.</p>

			<p>Many constituents have contacted me about the appalling and deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, after the Taliban took control of the capital city of Kabul on Sunday, August 15.</p>
<p>I share your profound concern and distress about the impact this will have on the lives of Afghan people, particularly women and those who have been working alongside NATO forces, NGOs and many others.</p>
<p>I was in the Chamber today to speak not only as the vice-Chair of the Afghanistan APPG, but also on behalf of my co-worker and dear friend Marzia Babakarkhail. Like so many others, Marzia had to flee her home in Afghanistan after the Taliban tried to assassinate her. You can watch my speech in full <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/392a628b-beda-4bc1-91df-584f2a1cdf90?in=13:37:34">here.</a></p>
<p>The present situation on-ground in Afghanistan is shocking and worsening by the hour. The withdrawal of international forces in the country, especially those of the U.S, has lead to the inevitable fall of the Afghani Government, just two weeks before the U.S. was due to complete its troop withdrawal. I remain extremely concerned about the speed with which the insurgents stormed across the country, capturing all major cities in a matter of days.</p>
<p>We now face the tragic rollback of the gains that UK soldiers, diplomats and NGO workers, and their coalition and Afghan partners made over the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Women and girls will lose the freedoms they gained and those speaking out face real threats to their lives alongside members of the LGBT+ community and religious minorities who were viciously targeted under Taliban rule and now face extermination. This is in part due to the catastrophic miscalculation of the capacity and legitimacy of the Afghan government, and the resilience of Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the U.S. and its allies. That the international community has been caught out in this way is quite shocking and speaks volumes about our priorities and the lack of a human rights focus in our foreign policies.</p>
<p>The international community&#8217;s response including the UK’s has been absolutely woeful and far too slow considering the immense danger so many are in as the situation is so fast-changing. This is a shameful dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>The immediate focus must be for the government to accelerate efforts to get UK nationals, support staff and the thousands of Afghans nationals who have served and worked alongside coalition forces out of the country. As well as the women activists who are now in grave danger of Taliban reprisals, many of whom have already faced threats. We have already seen reports of Taliban hit squads hunt down those they see as “collaborating” with coalition forces.</p>
<p>We should help lead that effort by committing to a British Afghanistan Resettlement Programme, to create safe and legal routes so those suffering at the hands of the Taliban can make a new life here in Britain. The Government’s proposal to take just an initial 5,000 refugees followed by only 20,000 over 5 years is not enough. Many of those at the highest risk will not survive waiting for five years to escape the Taliban. This policy must urgently be expanded to ensure people to whom we owe a huge debt are not abandoned because of an arbitrary target. And the promises made by ministers in Parliament must be reflected on the ground.</p>
<p>I support the deployment of troops to Kabul to provide security and capacity to carry out the evacuation. Soldiers and diplomats must be given the resources that they need. But it is increasingly clear there was a failure to plan for a safe and swift evacuation process and ministers have serious questions to answer over the lack of preparedness. Having said that I am also very grateful to Ambassador Bristow who is personally processing applications from Afghan nationals for refuge, and to Lord Tariq Ahmad who has been helping me to get a woman activist under threat and her husband out of Kabul.</p>
<p>Our veterans who served in Afghanistan as well as the families of those who died serving our country must know that their sacrifices were not in vain. The differences they have made to women and girls in particular are immense. What they must be feeling must be overwhelming; we must make sure that they get the resources and support they need.</p>
<p>The Taliban must be judged on what they do, not what they say. There are worrying reports of night raids and arrests of suspects by armed men with a number of local journalists and civil rights workers believed to have been detained. Women face obliteration of their rights, despite the warm words of the Taliban that too many have been willing to entertain. There have been reports of women being sent home from work and told to send their male relatives instead. There are reports of girls as young as ten are being sold off to Taliban fighters, mothers are having their eyes gouged out in front of their children, and reprisals against those who helped coalition forces. According to the UNHCR, women and children make up 80% of those fleeing the conflict.</p>
<p>The role of Pakistan in this conflict is absolutely key. During my speech, I called on the Foreign Secretary to restore specific aid funding to Pakistan in response to the influx of Afghan refugees who are crossing into Pakistan, as 350,000 Afghans are on the move inside the country.</p>
<p>The Pakistani Ambassador to the European Union, Zaheer Aslam Janjua recently disclosed that “Pakistan doesn’t have the capacity or the resources to take any more refugees” as Pakistan is already home to more than 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees, according to UN data. However, it is also home to an estimated two million more unregistered Afghan refugees, according to Pakistani government estimates.</p>
<p>Pakistan also has a potential role in moderating the Taliban’s behaviour. I am hopeful that the commitment that Pakistan has expressed to me over human rights in Kashmir will extend across the region – as you know human rights are universal. Pakistan has made clear that they need help from the international community in keeping the region terrorist-free and managing the 1600mile Durand line, which separates Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is something we could do collectively as this porous border poses a threat not just to Pakistan but to us all especially as there are already concerns that the Taliban might begin to question the legitimacy of the border now that it is in power.</p>
<p>The steps that Pakistan now takes will be vitally important as the Taliban’s takeover will affect the country more deeply than any other regional power and it is important that the UK government remains in dialogue with the Pakistani Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In the longer term, global Britain must work with its allies to restore not just our reputation but our role in facilitating a law and rules-based system with human rights across the world.</p>
<p>Please be assured, I will do all I can to continue to highlight the plight of the Afghan people.</p>

<p>I have to agree with many of the complaints, I believe that the payment instructions could be clearer. The ticket states a date and a time however, if you wait until the date shown, it’ll be too late and you’ll incur a £30 fine, I can see how many people are easily misunderstanding what the ticket says.</p>



<p>During the meeting, I asked the Chief Executive, Phill Smith if he could look at other options and suggested changes should be made to the wording on the tickets to make it clearer.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I learnt about plans for the tunnel to remove the barriers completely in a new system called&nbsp;Open Road Tolling.&nbsp; This would mean that there would be no barriers and payments will need to be made either using an online account or the pay later option. Tyne Tunnel 2 say this would increase tunnel capacity, reduce carbon emissions and mean more a more reliable and quicker journey through the tunnel.</p>



<p>However, I again expressed concern that more drivers may receive fines, as the onus would be&nbsp;on drivers to remember to pay the toll as under the new system, they would not receive a ticket which in many cases acts as a reminder. I also asked what facilities have TT2 put in place to support those drivers who do not have access to the internet, in order to pay their toll charge. It was explained that drivers who do not have smart phones or access to the internet could pay their toll at shops who have a PayPoint facility.</p>



<p>I feel many constituents’ pain and frustration. Many people have told me that the current system of pay later is confusing and lacks clarity, I agree and will continue to seek a resolution to this matter.</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Coronavirus issues and other local matters.<br />
<strong><br />
International Travel</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I have been asked by a number of people about the current rules for travel outside the UK and returning here. To find out what the rules are for entering any other country, you should look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Office Travel Advice</a>, which will tell you what the entry requirements are at the moment in each country.</p>
<p>For re-entering the UK, all of the current advice is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>South Western Railway &amp; Network Rail Timetable Consultation</strong></p>
<p>South Western Railway and Network Rail have launched a consultation about their plans for the post-Pandemic timetable from December 2022 onwards. This consultation is based on an assumption that considerably fewer people will be commuting going forward. The proposals represent a significant downgrading of the pre-pandemic timetable for our line into London Waterloo. They are intending to reduce the number of trains from Ashtead and Epsom in the peak from six trains an hour to four. This would be done by scrapping the services that start at Epsom and making the previous semi-fast service stop at Ewell West and Stoneleigh instead, as well as at all stations further in. At the same time they would make the current reduction in off-peak services permanent.</p>
<p>They will also at the same time introduce the new generation of trains onto our line, which are ten coaches with all of them connected to create an open plan route right through the train. Their argument is that the new trains will have significantly more capacity and will be able to carry as many people as before even with a reduced service. I do not buy that argument. I have met the company to raise my concerns about the plans, and I think it is much too early to judge what passenger numbers will be in nearly eighteen months time. This level of service would have been completely unworkable with pre-pandemic passenger numbers. I would encourage everyone to take part in the consultation and to make your view clear. The details are at <strong><a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/timetables/timetable-consultation-december-2022">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom &amp; Ewell Business Awards 2011-2021</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Epsom and Ewell Business Awards have just been launched for online entries and nominations. This will be the tenth year of the awards, and it’s a great opportunity to nominate your favourite local business, perhaps because of what they have done for you during the pandemic or because they just always look after you really well. Details of how to enter or nominate an entry are <strong><a href="https://www.epsombusinessawards.co.uk/">here</a></strong>. Please do get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering in the Local Community</strong></p>
<p>I know that many people locally put their names forward to volunteer in the community during the pandemic, and either have now finished that work or did not find the right opportunity to do so. If you are someone who is motivated to get involved or frustrated because your help wasn’t needed, I am planning a volunteering event to match potential volunteers with a small group of local charities who need extra help.</p>
<p>The event will be at <strong>St George’s, in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead on Friday 10th September</strong> from 4 until 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I will be sending out more details a few days before, but if you are interested please make a note in your diary.</p>
<p>I hope that you manage to enjoy something of a break this summer and that the weather improves.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br />
Chris</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my July&nbsp;email newsletter. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well during this challenging time, as we start to try to return to normality from the pandemic and enjoy the Summer, whilst still trying to be cautious and sensible with precautions where possible&nbsp;in the face of rising cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is only right that at this critical juncture in our journey out of lockdown, we take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices of the wonderful people who make up our NHS, our key workers, and all those involved in the vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you&#8217;ll find updates on the latest cases and vaccination restrictions, a link to my new online survey and details of what&#8217;s been happening in Parliament and around Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Online Summer Survey – let me know your views:</u></strong></p>



<p>As we head towards Summer Recess in Parliament, I’m about to start delivering my annual report across Amber Valley – please say hello if you see me out and about.</p>



<p>In the report and online, I’m launching a survey to get your views on local issues and recovering from Covid-19, from health appointments to boosting our economy.</p>



<p>Please take just a couple of minutes to complete my Summer Survey and let me know your views <a href="https://www.nigelmillsmp.com/nigels-summer-survey/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing Lockdown Restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 19<sup>th </sup>July 2021, the Government lifted all remaining restrictions on social distancing in England. This represents a further step towards normality as we adjust to living with this virus. Although coronavirus cases are continuing to rise nationally, we have not seen the corresponding rise in hospitalisations and deaths that we would expect given the rates of illness we observed last year. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly clear that the link between infections and serious illness is sufficiently broken to enable this further relaxation of restrictions. However, we must remain careful and exercise our own good judgement to keep transmission in our local community to a minimum.</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Case Rates</u></strong></p>



<p>The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant continues to spread across the country and Public Health England (PHE) is now confident that it has overtaken the Alpha variant to become the most dominant strain of the virus circulating in the UK. The Delta variant is believed to be around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which itself is more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. Encouragingly however, new analysis by PHE shows that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.</p>



<p>As predicted in light of this, cases continue to rise nationally, and this trend is no different locally in Amber Valley. You can find the latest case data <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read?postcode=DE7%206DG">here</a>. We are now ahead of the England average which highlights the need for us to remain careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Vaccines</u></strong></p>



<p>The Country’s vaccine program continues apace with more than 46.2 million people in the UK having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine &#8211; part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.</p>



<p>I was pleased to see the rollout expanded after the Government hit its target of offering a first jab to everyone in the top priority groups &#8211; all those over the age of 50, plus those in high-risk categories by mid-April. With every adult in the UK now having been offered their first dose of the vaccine. A terrific effort, nationally and locally.</p>



<p>As of last Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> July, Amber Valley had successfully given at least one dose of the vaccine to 88% of local adults, with 72.8% having received both jabs. This remains slightly above the average for England which stands at 87.7% of adults having received one jab, and 68% both jabs. These figures are a testament to the exemplary vaccine program here in our constituency.</p>



<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team, and the local NHS to ensure that this area continues to see the full roll out of vaccines.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing of restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>As of Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July, all legal restrictions on social distancing in England have been lifted. This is truly excellent news, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing Amber Valley businesses, organisations, and individuals operating at full capacity without legal restrictions.</p>



<p>The following measures are now in place across England:</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on how many people can meet.</p>



<p>&#8211; 1m-plus rule removed (except in some places like hospitals).</p>



<p>&#8211; Face coverings no longer required by law.</p>



<p>&#8211; Nightclubs can open.</p>



<p>&#8211; Pubs and restaurants no longer table service only.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on guests at weddings and funerals.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on people attending concerts, theatres or sports events.</p>



<p>&#8211; No restrictions on communal worship.</p>



<p>It is important to remember, however, that this easing of restrictions is designed to empower ourselves as individuals to use our common sense to slow the spread of the virus, which is still very present in our communities. Therefore, I implore you to enjoy these new freedoms responsibly.</p>



<p>As ever, to find out more information on what restrictions apply in your area please look <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting our local economy</u></strong></p>



<p>As we try to re-open, it&#8217;s key to support our local economy to bounce back, and provide a boost to local jobs and businesses. Unemployment is Amber Valley is currently at 4.2%, which is below the national average of 5.6% and 150 lower than in May 2021. As the Job Retention Scheme (furlough) starts to wind down, we need to remain cautious, but there are lots of vacancies around and local employers advertising job opportunities, including the Kickstart Scheme to help young people get back into work. I&#8217;ll also look to organise a Job Fair, maybe initially virtually, over the next few months &#8211; please get in touch if you&#8217;d like to be involved in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Borders Bill</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve recently welcomed the Government’s New Plan for Immigration, also known as the Borders Bill, into parliament. This legislation intends to:</p>



<ul><li>Speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals.</li><li>Introduce maximum life sentences for people smugglers.</li><li>Empower the Border Force to do more to stop and seize small boats and search containers for hidden migrants.</li><li>Stop illegal arrivals gaining immediate entry into the asylum system if they have travelled through a safe county (like France).</li><li>Increase the maximum sentence for illegally entering the UK.</li><li>Grant resettled refugees indefinite leave to remain.</li><li>Better integrate refugees who are resettled.</li></ul>



<p>I know constituents want more to be done to reduce illegal immigration. I will, therefore, continue to engage with ministers throughout this Bill’s journey through parliament to ensure the Government delivers on its manifesto commitments of reducing illegal immigration to UK.</p>



<p><strong><u>In Parliament:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament this month, I&#8217;ve been asking questions on travel restrictions, catch-up education and English Votes for English Laws legislation.</p>



<p>During recent questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, I raised the issue on behalf of constituents of families with children under 18 wanting to travel abroad, but who aren&#8217;t eligible for the vaccine as yet. I&#8217;m pleased the Secretary of State agreed to look into this issue, and you can find out more on his answer <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-19b.670.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g680.4">here</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also asked the Secretary of State for Education about catch-up tutoring for school pupils following the pandemic, and you can find the full debate on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-06c.768.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g776.0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, during Business Questions in the House, I asked about the continuation of English Votes for English Laws legislation, as part of a continued fair settlement of devolution across the UK. You can find more on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-06-24b.1011.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1023.2">here</a>&nbsp;and on my Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/nigelmills">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Solar Farm</u></strong></p>



<p>Locally, I’ve been working with local residents and councillors to help oppose plans to construct a 310-acre solar farm on a vast swathe of green space between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. The solar farm has been proposed by Kronos Solar and is subject to several planning applications across Amber Valley Borough Council and North East Derbyshire District Council. I think this would destroy our local landscape due it&#8217;s scale and extent, so whilst I&#8217;m not against renewable energy or solar panels, I think these applications are inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The applications are still awaiting determination by the councils (likely to be in September) so there&#8217;s still time to comment or lodge any concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find details of the residents&#8217; objection group, and information on the individual applications and how to comment if you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savealfretoncountryside/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council Local Plan consultation &#8211; Have your say!</u></strong></p>



<p>The new administration at the Borough Council has launched a new consultation on the next stage of preparing Amber Valley&#8217;s Local Plan, a development document which will set out and plan future housing growth in the area, and making sure we have the infrastructure improvements to match any new homes. I welcome the planned reduction in the overall number of new homes being proposed, which is part of the consultation. The Council are also consulting on the options for the overall strategy (spatial strategy) of the plan, which include focusing housing growth on the Derby City urban area border, in and around Amber Valley&#8217;s four key towns, or in the wider area and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation on the proposals and headline strategy for the plan so far is open from now until the 30th September 2021. Please do take opportunity to feed in your views to the Council &#8211; I know how strongly residents rightly feel over housing in our area, and so this is the most important chance to have your say on making sure we protect our Green Belt and shaping&nbsp;the future of planning in our area. You can find the consultation and how to submit your views on the proposals <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/alternative-spatial-strategy-options-for-housing-and-economic-growth/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In response to a question at July Full Council, the Portfolio Holder for Finance and Resources has called on the Government to retain the £20 a week uplift in Universal Credit<strong> – </strong>highlighting how it supports many low paid working people in Nottingham.<br><br>There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham and in response to the pandemic in April last year the Government introduced an increase in payments of £20 a week. There is growing speculation that the Government will reverse the uplift later this year resulting in increasing difficulty for many people who are already struggling.<br><br>Responding to a question at Full Council on the issue, Cllr Sam Webster said “Universal Credit supports low paid working people in our city, tens of thousands of children in our city and people who are entitled to support with housing costs or have lost their job during the Covid pandemic.”</p>



<p>Cllr Webster commenting on the
consequences of the £20 a week uplift being reversed warned that “It will often
be felt most acutely by Nottingham children who are growing up in families
where there already isn’t much money around, families who are living in
poverty.”</p>



<p>In January this year Nottingham City Council passed a motion urging the Government to retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit and urging an extension of the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support. This was followed up by a letter from the Leader of Nottingham City Council to the Chancellor emphasising the importance of the £20 a week uplift. <br> <br> Cllr Webster continued his response by saying “Lower paid and lower skilled working people are much more likely to have lost their job, not be able to work from home, have additional childcare needs, have gone through periods of Covid isolation without receiving pay, have lost hours at work&#8230;.and the list goes on.&nbsp;Reducing Universal Credit now would be big blow to many families who are already struggling to make ends meet.” He also argued that the uplift in Universal Credit should be seen as a litmus test for how seriously the Government is about levelling, saying to not make the uplift permanent would be a case of “levelling down”.<br><br>Cllr Webster ended by saying “In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago it was (and still is) shameful that the poorest people in this country were made to pay the price of mistakes made by the wealthiest. In terms of the policies that our national politicians pursue &#8211; this is one of those markers &#8211; who will The Conservative Government expect to pay for this latest economic and public debt crisis?&nbsp; The message from Labour in Nottingham is crystal clear &#8211; let it not be the poorest families again.”<br><br></p>

<p>After holding a constituents surgery in the morning, Mr Shapps went to the Galleria in Hatfield to visit Potential Kids. There, Grant went to see how they had been doing since the launch of their ‘Learn to Ride’ sessions earlier in April.</p>
<p>Potential Kids is a local charity that provides learning, social and sport opportunities to children who are neurodiverse, as well as their families. Their ‘Learn to Ride’ programme provides 1 on 1 bike riding lessons to children.</p>
<p>Speaking about the visit Angela Gaughan, founder of Potential Kids said: &#8220;We were delighted to have the opportunity to talk with the Grant Shapps about the joint project between Hatfields Mens Sheds and Potential Kids.</p>
<p>“Being able to teach children and young people to ride and maintain a bike provides life-long skills that promote independence, mental health and self-esteem, whilst encouraging physical activity and time spent outdoors in the fresh air.</p>
<p>“Grant also had the opportunity to see our Community and Learning Garden project, &#8216;Potential to Grow&#8217;, which has been successfully running over the last 11 months.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for the support we have received in developing this project. Our continued thanks go to Tim Sterling, Center Director at the Galleria for our Hub and Garden and to Welwyn Hatfield Council for their support to build our new kitchen area. Which will enable us to run fun cooking sessions for neurodiverse children, young people, their siblings, and families in the local area, using healthy ingredients grown in our very own garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “Potential Kids look to be doing brilliant work here. I’ve spent a bit of time talking to the leaders here and learning about their work, and the cycling programme more specifically.</p>
<p>“Cycling is great way to get from A to B- it’s healthy for you, and great for the planet. Learning to ride a bike as a child is something that all kids should experience, and it’s great to see that Potential Kids are helping make sure every child has that opportunity.”</p></div>

Mr Shapps toured some recent changes in the town centre, including a new outdoor dining area.</p>
<p> A representative of WGC BID said: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 14px;">We thank Grant for taking time out of his very busy schedule to come to WGC town centre and hear about the BID renewal and how the businesses in WGC are coping with the impact of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;It has been a tough time for everyone but we are working together to ensure the recovery of our town centre”</span></p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “As we are moving away from covid restrictions- thanks in no small part to our amazing vaccination effort- it’s vital that our local businesses can get back on their feet and adapt to life post-covid.</p>
<p>“Visiting the town centre in Welwyn Garden City today and meeting with the local BID group, I’m confident that we’ll be able to spring back and make the most of what life post-covid has to offer.”</p></div>

<p>Natalie Bennett, a partner at Off Broadway Travel, told Travel Weekly: “He took everything on board, he listened to us, and it went well. He appreciated that travel had been made illegal and said he would talk to the chancellor [about further sector specific support].</p>

<p>There seems to be a webinar for everything — from cooking an apple pie and setting up your email list to creating a company and making your first million. This form of interaction with the target audience became popular for a good reason. It allows to achieve numerous goals:</p>



<ul><li>Selling products</li><li>Attracting new audience</li><li>Improving engagement</li><li>Building and improving brand awareness</li><li>Creating an image of an expert for yourself or your company</li><li>Distributing content</li></ul>



<p>And that’s we’ve just scratched the surface. Every person who creates a webinar has their own unique goals in mind. This wide array of benefits is what makes webinars such a great way to promote your brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="706" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-164" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-325x211.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /></figure>



<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>

<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
