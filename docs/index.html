<p>Conservative Councillors write about the failure to provide the 6<sup>th</sup> form at Bohunt on time</p>
<p>Bohunt Sixth form expansion delayed again&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2022 following a long public campaign by residents of Finchampstead Wokingham Borough Council reached a deal with the Bohunt Trust to expand the educational provision at Bohunt School. Two petitions were raised by local residents with well over 1400 signatures and the campaign was supported by local conservative cllrs as well as the local MP James Sunderland. This agreement was that WBC and Bohunt would fund the provision of a brand new 6th form facility, additional year 7 places and send provision. This new facility was scheduled to open in September 2023 giving much needed provision for an additional 200 &#8211; 300 pupils</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2022 following the local elections the Liberal Democrats took control of Wokingham Council. In public they were keen to reassure residents they still planned to proceed with expansion at Bohunt however the lack of any meaningful progress on the ground made it clear that all was not well. Costs had risen on the building programme and the crucial stumbling block was Wokingham Borough Council insisting on a new scope and refusing to part fund its share. 14 months after the Liberals took control of the council there is still no agreement on funding and without movement from Wokingham Borough Council no chance of this moving forwards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been advised that even if funding was agreed today there is little chance of a new building being ready by September 2024 due to logistical issues of construction and hiring the relevant staff. The council have now formally admitted the sixth form will not open ( as they promised at the may 2023 local elections ) in September 2023. It is now time for them to be honest and commit publicly to fund this expansion rather than the endless misleading statements about commitment with no funding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very dissapointed that WBC continues to fail to honour the promises it gave to the Finchampstead and Aborfield community in March 2022. It is wrong that children from across the south of the borough face long journeys out of borough at Farnborough or to the north of wokingham for 6th form provision because there is no facility nearby. It is wrong that WBC is building 2 new send schools on green fields at Rooks Nest when alternative provision could have been provided earlier and at less cost to the taxpayer at Bohunt. It is wrong that WBC is walking away from additional year 7 provision at Bohunt meaning children from Finchampstead face long journeys across wokingham every day because the capacity at bohunt is full. The catchment area at bohunt gets smaller year by year. Bohunt is a successful and well loved school. WBC should be supporting and developing successful schools in the borough. Children in the south of the borough are being treated like second class citizens and this is not acceptable. The south is forced to take all the housing but gets no infrastructure &#8211; this is wrong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We remain fully committed to seeing the 6th form, extra year 7 and send provision at Bohunt and will continue to campaign for this important facility to be provided</p>

<p>Nine hundred prosecutions—all the postmasters involved have their own stories of dreams crushed, careers ruined, families destroyed, reputations smashed and lives lost. Innocent people have been bankrupted and imprisoned. This may well be the largest miscarriage of justice in our country’s history, and I pay tribute to Members on all sides of this House who have worked for justice, none more so than my right hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones). I also thank the advisory board and Sir Wyn for their work, as well as the Minister for the constructive approach he has taken on this issue to date.</p>
<p>However, as Sir Wyn’s interim report makes clear, the compensation schemes for postmasters are a mess. The commitment to give fair compensation should apply to all postmasters. Sir Wyn specifically recommends that terms of reference should enable the monitoring of individual cases. Can the Minister say that he will act on that recommendation, and when can we expect him to respond in full to the report’s recommendations, including maximising the use of the Horizon compensation advisory board and providing clarity about the tax status of compensation payments? Can he also provide a final figure for claims that have been made to the historical shortfall scheme and how much the Government anticipate the final compensation will cost?</p>
<p>I also ask the Minister what he is going to do about Post Office management. As the only shareholder in the Post Office, does his Department take responsibility for addressing those management issues? The leadership team accepted bonuses for their work on the inquiry, which is just unacceptable. When will the Minister deal with this? Sub-postmasters have had their lives ruined: they must be confident that lessons will be learned from those failures. Sadly, it seems that the Post Office has failed to do so.</p>

<p>The nature of my job means that I often find myself on trains. Some travelling to home to Manchester, others to London, and the rest to various media, campaigning and constituency events.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this since 2005, so have seen an awful lot of the rail network. What always strikes me, however, is how rapidly the service for passengers has declined over the last 13 years.</p>
<p>Not only are fares more expensive, but cancellations are more frequent. On Monday I had to get over to Selby for by-election campaigning. My transpennine direct train was cancelled, meaning I had to get on a train to Huddersfield, then York, then Selby.</p>
<p>I don’t tell this story for sympathy, but instead to paint a picture of what many millions of commuters have to go through in one form or another every week in Britain. In 2023, it is frankly staggering that travelling from one part of the country to another is still fraught with pitfalls, cancellations and poor service.</p>
<p>Sadly, our railways are not the only public service that has suffered from mismanagement and neglect. We’ve all seen the stories of sewage being pumped routinely into our waterways, of the Government sitting on its hands and refusing to clamp down on this practice.</p>
<p>So too has our NHS suffered. Despite the efforts of heroic NHS staff, 13 years of neglect and mismanagement have left us with a burned-out workforce and the highest waiting times and the lowest patient satisfaction ratings on record.</p>
<p>Given these problems, and combined with soaring inflation and rising mortgage costs, it’s no surprise that constituents regularly ask me “Why does nothing work in Britain?”.</p>
<p>It’s important, however, that we don’t get despondent. Things can and will get better, but it requires political will.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ve been so pleased to hear Labour’s plans to tackle these issues in the round. To sort our railways, to tackle failing water companies and to give our NHS the staff, technology and reform it needs to thrive.</p>
<p>That these pledges sound ambitious is an indication of just how far things have fallen over the last 13 years.</p>
<p>But I’m certain that with a fresh start under Keir Starmer, we can get to work in improving the lives of the people I represent across <span class="mark06qsm5mlz" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">Tameside</span>.</p>
<p>That’s why I got into politics, and in 5 years&#8217; time I hope to be able to look back on this article with bemusement, from a Britain where things actually work for ordinary people.</p>

              <h3>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday, during a debate in Westminster Hall on teaching assistant's pay, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron supported a petition calling for better pay for the position.</p>
<p>During the debate Tim highlighted how important the position was to schools who cater for children with special education needs or in the current economic climate within Cumbria. Tim made the point that the average wage of a teaching assistant is £19000 which is reduced to just over £14,000 if they are only paid during term-time; a regular occurrence due to budget constraints.</p>
<p>Tim said during the debate: <em>"I ask the Minister to think very carefully about the impact on children of having demoralised teaching assistants who are either taking second and third jobs just to keep themselves going or, more likely, leaving the profession altogether.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"What does that mean for the quality of education? What does it mean for the stress levels of the teachers left behind to deal with large classes without any help whatsoever? What does it mean for children with special educational needs?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"We know how long it takes these days to get an education, health and care plan. Schools and teaching assistants have to carry the load before an EHCP is provided, and even when one is provided it is the schools that have to come up with the first £6,000 of the cost. Teaching assistants spend time with those children with the greatest level of need.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"If we want them to thrive, we need to invest in them, and that means paying people enough to keep them in their profession for a long time."</em>
</p>
<p>Tim also discussed the recent proposed pay raises for teachers which he called <em>"overdue and insufficient".</em> The offer currently stands at 6.5% of which 3.5% is unfunded from the Government. This leaves schools to find extra money from their already overstretched budgets to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>He said: "<em>What can schools do? They cannot put prices up or increase their commercial revenue. They will, of course, pay the teachers their pay award, but that will mean having to cut other staff-which very often means teaching assistants. I am afraid that it looks like schools are having to pit teachers' pay awards against having teaching assistants. These folk, who are on low wages but do immense work, are being let go. I cannot think of a single school in my part of Cumbria that is not at least contemplating doing that."</em></p>

<p>Like many of my constituents, I am concerned about dangerous driving and parking on Birmingham&#8217;s roads. </p>



<p>I have recently sent a letter to the Chief Executive and Leader of Birmingham City Council about the issues constituents have raised with me. I look forward to hearing from them about the Council&#8217;s plans to tackle this growing problem.</p>



<p>You can read my full letter to the Council below.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dear Ms Cadman and Cllr Cotton</p>



<p><strong>Re: Road Danger Reduction in Birmingham</strong></p>



<p>I am writing to express my concerns about dangerous driving and road safety in Birmingham.</p>



<p>Many of my constituents have contacted me recently to highlight their own worries and grievances. I have made enquiries to Birmingham City Council on behalf of my constituents but I am disappointed that most of the responses I have received state that measures can only be put in place when a certain number of collisions have occurred. I am concerned that the collision needs to have been reported to the police and at least one person injured.&nbsp;This is a reactive method and I believe the people of Birmingham deserve prevention techniques&nbsp;instead.</p>



<p>I have received many enquiries from parents and staff at schools across the constituency about dangerous driving and parking when children are being dropped off and picked up from school. The problems include parents parking on double yellow lines and drivers knocking over stands in the road designed to keep the children safe. I have recently been made aware of a ‘Park and Stride’ initiative at a local primary school, where parents park further away in a car park&nbsp;and walk the remaining&nbsp;distance to school. Could the Council work with local businesses to help further schools implement similar initiatives?</p>



<p>You will be aware of my work with Tiverton Academy in particular. I was disappointed with the response I received to this enquiry. Similarly to other responses, I was informed&nbsp;that the lack of personal injury collisions meant that this area could not be prioritised. I am disheartened at this response, especially given that young children are being put in danger by the driving and parking outside Tiverton. I agree with the statement in the response that the issues outside Tiverton do occur at schools across the city. However, I believe every school needs to be looked at contextually. For example, there is a bus route outside Tiverton&nbsp;and the wide catchment area makes it more difficult for children to walk and cycle to school than in other locations in Birmingham. I do not believe the unique features&nbsp;of Tiverton’s situation were considered in the response I received.</p>



<p>An area of particular concern to my constituents is Kings Heath and the immediate vicinity. I have spoken to many constituents about problems with speeding on Broad Lane and Brandwood Park Road. I have met with several constituents whose houses have been crashed into by speeding cars, leaving significant damage to their properties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am concerned that the Low Traffic Neighbourhood in Kings Heath is pushing traffic into other parts of the area, which is simply moving these problems rather than solving them.&nbsp;Many constituents have raised similar concerns with me about the proposals for Bournville and Cotteridge.&nbsp;Therefore, we need a more holistic approach to make our roads safer, rather than a piecemeal operation.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I receive frequent complaints about speeding and dangerous driving in the constituency.&nbsp;I understand that the Council’s resources cannot allow for speed cameras and monitoring measures&nbsp;everywhere. However, has the Council discussed alternatives with West Midlands Police?</p>



<p>I would be grateful if you could provide me with a response to my above concerns and comments.&nbsp;I am keen to hear about the measures&nbsp;the Council is implementing&nbsp;to ensure road danger reduction across the whole of my constituency.&nbsp;I do not believe we should&nbsp;wait for personal injury collisions to meet thresholds before action is taken.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely<br>Steve McCabe MP<br>Member of Parliament for Birmingham Selly Oak&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Grant Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, welcomed Google to his constituency where they hosted a ‘Digital Garage’ which sought to support local businesses and individuals in improving their digital skills.<br><br></strong>Google Digital Garage is a multi-million-pound investment in free digital skills training for adults in the UK. Over the last five years, the programme has trained over 800,000 small businesses and individuals, providing free digital skills training both in person and online.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>Over 30 local businesses attended this free event which hosted a variety of workshops and talks. They focused on a wide range of digital skills from branding to social media to graphic design. The individuals in attendance were invited to put questions to Google’s Digital Coaches about how they might better utilise these digital skills to help grow their businesses.<br><br>Mr Shapps had previously invited Google to his constituency to host this event and was very pleased they could help level up the digital skills of the many fantastic local businesses in Welwyn Hatfield. He met both local businesses owners and residents who attended and talked to them about how they were going take their business to the next level thanks to the new skills they learnt from Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Mr Shapps commented:<br><br>“It was great to welcome Google for part of their Google Digital Garage tour. I was really pleased to see so many local businesses and residents attend to hear from Google’s fantastic Digital Garage trainers, and I enjoyed meeting a number of local businesses and residents, to hear about how they plan to use the skills learnt today, and to see first-hand the importance of improving digital skills”.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Rikesh Valand, Google Digital Garage trainer from Google, who helped facilitate the event, thanked Mr Shapps for attending<br><br>“It was great to be joined by Grant Shapps MP in Welwyn Hatfield today for a Google Digital Garage. As ever, we as trainers love getting on the road and speaking to business owners and individuals across the country about their needs, and how the Digital Garage and Skills to Go training programmes can help them in their professional lives.”<br><br>He continued:</p>



<p>“Thank you to Grant Shapps MP for joining us, to learn more about the programme and to support their constituents”.<br>Mr Shapps thanked Google for putting on this fantastic event and looks forward to seeing local businesses make use of their new digital skills in the future.<br></p>

<p>The signing comes as a new government report reveals one in every 100 UK workers was employed by a business headquartered in a CPTPP member nation in 2019, equating to over 400,000 jobs across the country.   </p>

<p>Membership of the trade group is expected to spark further investment in the UK by CPTPP countries, already worth £182 billion in 2021, by guaranteeing protections for investors.  </p>

<p><strong>Mr Dunne said: </strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Growing our economy relies on boosting trade across the globe, and tariff free access to some of the fastest growing markets in the world is a crucial step in driving forward UK sales to international consumers.  </p>

<p>“Joining the CPTPP trade bloc is a very welcome step for businesses here in South Shropshire, which will help support growing businesses and job creation for the future.” </p>

<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has praised the impact of a voluntary group in West Dunbartonshire helping to provide door-to-door transport for vulnerable residents.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064785753378">West Dunbartonshire Community Transport</a> (WDCT) was established in 2019 to help reduce social isolation by working with community groups, and improve health outcomes by helping people to health appointments.</p>



<p>The volunteer-led group runs a free Health Appointment Transport Scheme for residents across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven – helping people with essential journeys including GP and hospital visits.</p>



<p>The area’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes met with community transport volunteers during a visit in Dumbarton, and is supporting a recruitment drive for volunteer drivers.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“I have been really impressed by the work of the volunteers at West Dunbartonshire Community Transport (WDCT). They are providing a valuable service for residents who would otherwise find it challenging to travel for essential healthcare appointments.</p>



<p>“The free community transport initiative particularly benefits vulnerable people; helping to tackle social isolation and improve health outcomes.</p>



<p>“I was delighted to catch-up with the team at WDCT and hope to see them serving the communities of West Dunbartonshire for years to come.</p>



<p>“The charity’s community driver scheme is currently on the lookout for volunteers – I’d encourage anyone interested in volunteering to get in touch.”</p>



<p><em><strong>If you’d like to book transport with WDCT – or are interested in helping out as a volunteer driver – you can contact the charity by email on <a href="mailto:wdctag@gmail.com">wdctag@gmail.com</a> or call 07990 825 754.</strong></em></p>

<p>I started the week in Uxbridge supporting the efforts of Labour’s candidate Danny Beales in the by-election that is taking place next week.<br />
It’s clear that the people in Uxbridge are annoyed and frustrated with what they see as an absentee MP and want an MP who will representative them to Parliament and be a real party of their community.</p>
<p>Listening to voters in Uxbridge, there were lots of overlaps with the issues I am contacted about by my constituents in Bristol South. From the Cost-of-Living Crisis, particularly rising mortgage and rent costs, food price rises and soaring energy bills to concerns about our health service and police numbers. Only a Labour Government can now give the country a fresh start and deal with the issues that ordinary people are facing every day.</p>
<p>In Parliament this week, I was pleased to speak on the importance of pharmacy services, the way they can help ease pressure on GPs and A&amp;Es and highlight the challenges that people are facing when trying to find a local pharmacist.</p>
<p>Across the country, those who rely on local, accessible pharmacies are finding it more and more difficult to access the services they need. Whether it is because of the closure of pharmacies on the high street or supply problems leading to situations where women are having to chase around to find the correct prescribed dose of hormone replacement therapy drugs, it is not good enough.<br />
The repeated announcements from the Government’s plans to expand the role of community pharmacies have not been followed up with action and the needed updates to legislation that could help has not been brought forward.</p>
<p>The House of Commons keeps ending earlier than normal and there is plenty of time for MPs to consider the rule changes that could help pharmacies so there is no good reason for this problem to continue.</p>
<p>Continuing the focus of pharmacies, I was able to speak at the launch event for the Pharmaceuticals sponsored report on ‘Model of Pharmacy in Years 2025-2030’.</p>
<p>There has been some fantastic research from Sigma Plc and the University of Bath into the work that pharmacies can offer. I’m pleased that the Labour Party has committed to ensuring that community pharmacies will be a key part of our reforming agenda if we win the next election.</p>
<p>I met students from Bedminster Down, Merchants Academy and Bridge Learning Campus. The students visited London and Parliament as part of the South Bristol Youth programme to help young people find out about apprenticeships, higher education and high-quality employment. Unfortunately, the timetable meant I didn&#8217;t get to see the pupils from Ashton Park and St Bernadettes. These visits happen because of great work done by South Bristol Youth and Parliament’s Democratic Access tours and the students were great at quizzing me about my work and role and key issues for Bristol South. Top of the issue list being buses.</p>
<p>The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) met this week to talk to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to examine standards and the appointment processes in Government.<br />
We also spoke to Darren Tierney, the Director General of the Propriety and Ethics Team.</p>
<p>There has been concern recently with appointments to the House of Lords after the former Prime Minister’s resignation honours list provoked controversy. It is unclear how many of his appointments will contribute to just and effective law-making and highlights the need to reform the House of Lords and bring much needed openness and transparency.</p>
<p>Today, I had a wonderful visit to Knowle DGE, a specialist academy for young people with additional educational needs. I am always pleased to see students thrive in an environment where their individual needs and challenges are understood. The staff are supportive and allow the learners to achieve their potential while meeting the demands of the national curriculum in areas such as speech and communication and emotional mental health.</p>
<p>The school is a caring and enthusiastic place with happy students.  I can only say “Thank you” for having me!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to another hectic weekend in the constituency – I’ll be visiting the Holy Nativity ‘Open Church’ event and the Wilmott Park Bowls Club. If you’re also going to be there, please come and say hi – I’d love a chat!</p>

<p>Mr MacNeil has been in contact with the Scottish Government calling for a staggered release of vehicle bookings which would improve access to ferries for all, including islands residents who need to travel at short notice.</p>



<p>Commenting on the response he received from the Transport Minister, Mr MacNeil said: “I am very pleased to hear that Calmac are working with Transport Scotland and island communities to investigate a pilot to hold back some vehicle deck capacity for short-notice travel.</p>



<p>“I have been suggesting that, regardless of where people come from, there be a staggered release of space on car decks. 70% in the beginning, then 20% the month before and the last 10% in the week before the sailing. This gives different types of travellers, regardless of where people live, the ability to make these bookings. It gives businesses and people who need to travel at short notice or attend hospital, the hope of being able to travel.”</p>



<p>As part of the Islands Connectivity Plan (ICP) alongside the wider Fair Fares Review, Transport Scotland will consider all issues raised around this proposal. Engagement and consultation will be central to the ICP and will provide the opportunity to ensure that the ferry policy addresses the needs of island residents, businesses, and communities.</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">Since being elected in 2015, it has been my absolute privilege to serve the diverse communities of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency. Therefore, today’s Boundary Commission announcement brings both personal sadness and a wider concern for our region.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The changes mean that at next year&#8217;s General Election, our region will only be represented by two constituencies, reduced from the current three, and that is bad news for us all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, the re-drawn boundaries mean that, regardless of the wishes of the voters at the ballot box, I will no longer represent some of the communities I hold dear in the next election.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While the plans to reduce representation without fully considering our region&#8217;s unique geography and distinct needs are disheartening, the Commission did see sense and made some changes from previous proposals. In that regard, I want to thank everyone who shared their views with the Boundary Commission.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our concerted campaigning means the communities of Culloden, Balloch, and Smithton have been returned to the Inverness constituency where they rightfully belong, and new constituency titles now rightly include other communities such as Skye, Nairn, and Strathspey.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to the opportunity to continue serving the City of Inverness, Aird &amp; Loch Ness and other neighbouring communities while establishing new friendships with the residents of Skye, Fort William and Wester Ross communities as I seek to represent their distinct needs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the challenges these changes bring, I remain dedicated to serving all our communities. Your voices and your needs are at the heart of my work and, together with my SNP colleagues, I will continue to strive for the very best outcomes for our communities.</p>

Barnardo’s staff told me they are very concerned that the UK Government’s Illegal Migration Bill will deny children the help and protection they desperately need because in its current form it would prevent children from putting forward their case for asylum in the UK, as well as disqualifying some groups of children who have been identified as victims of trafficking from receiving protection and support. In 2014, the UK Government rightly banned detention of children for longer than 24 hours and its deeply worrying that this Bill would reverse this by allowing children arriving alone or with their families to be detained for longer periods.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.arcouk.org/">Association of Retirement Community Operators</a> (ARCO) held an event to launch its manifesto “<a href="https://www.arcouk.org/press-release/arcos-manifesto-for-older-peoples-housing-an-irc-in-every-town">An IRC for the provision of Integrated Retirement Communities (IRCs) in the UK</a>”. ARCO is the principal body representing private and not-for-profit operators of housing with care schemes in the UK. An IRC sometimes referred to as “housing-with-care”, “assisted living”, or “extra-care”, and is specialised housing for older people, distinct and separate to both residential care homes, as well as traditional models of retirement housing such as “sheltered housing” with a visiting warden or manager. The key features of an IRC are: every resident has their own front door, kitchen, and bathroom; 24/7 online support; shared facilities including, lounges, restaurants, gyms, hairdressers, shops, leisure facilities; with the option to buy, rent, or social rent. IRCs are operated by charities, housing associations, and private companies. People are living longer than ever before, and need housing that improves their well-being, with access to services. ARCO maintains that IRCs would save the NHS and Social Care budget up to £1 billion per year and alleviate loneliness, and urges the UK Government to increase IRCs across the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I had the honour of meeting Andy, a survivor of suffering cardiac arrest, and Bernie, who had saved a person’s life who was having a cardiac arrest by administering CPR, at the Resuscitation Council UK (RCUK) drop-in at Westminster. RCUK want to raise awareness of the urgent need to have a recovery plan to ensure people who have a cardiac arrest get the follow-up care they urgently need. A cardiac arrest is the ultimate medical emergency when the heart stops beating, and the person is clinically dead. But cardiac arrest survivors are not offered the same well-established rehabilitation services that stroke and heart attack survivors receive. Andy told me that he and his family struggled with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, and there needs to be a consistent formal care pathway across the UK. I support the RCUK campaign “<a href="https://www.resus.org.uk/get-involved/my-right-cardiac-arrest-recovery">My Right to Cardiac Arrest Recovery</a>“.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended Unison’s and the RAC’s launch of their report “<a href="https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2022/11/mileage-rate-rise-needed-urgently-for-public-sector-staff/">Driven out of work: the impact of mileage rates on frontline public service workers</a>”, which highlights the effect of out-of-date rates and the cars they drive: one-in-five is required to drive to do their job; they are paid significantly lower average wages; drive significant distances and can be left thousands of pounds out of pocket; and many use food banks and take out loans. The report recommends that: the UK Government should increase mileage rates to 63.4p per mile; HMRC approved rates be restructured to remove the 10,000 miles cap; urgent action on public sector pay and low wages so staff are not in a vulnerable situation; and investment in public sector electric vehicles.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met some wonderful hard working, dedicated members of the Prison Officers Association (POA) at their Parliamentary reception to launch their “<a href="https://www.poauk.org.uk/support/68-is-too-late/">68 is Too Late</a>” report. The POA has been concerned for many years about violence in our prison system and disagree with the UK Government’s view that prison officer grades along with operational support grades in public sector prisons should have their pension age linked to the state pension age, which will eventually rise to 68. The POA also call on the UK Government to hold a Royal Commission into our prisons and the whole criminal justice system, from probation to courts to policing. The POA want to partner with PCS, NAPO, Police Federation, Community, GMB, Unite, Howard League, Prison Transform Trust, and others to urge the UK Government to have a root and branch review into the state of the justice system. The campaign will be cross-party to make sure that a Royal Commission will be in their manifestos for the next General Election. The Conservative Party included it in its 2019 Manifesto but has failed to deliver so far. General Secretary of the POA, Steve Gillan, introduced the launch and Secretary General of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) Mick Whelan was the guest speaker.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was elected as a vice-chair at the AGM for the APPG Limits on Growth, which was followed by a briefing from MEP Philippe Lamberts on the impact of the <a href="https://www.beyond-growth-2023.eu/">Beyond Growth Conference</a> held last month in the EU Parliament. The conference was opened by EU President Ursula von der Leyen and presented a step change on political thinking on limits to growth. Philippe summarised the findings of the conference, and highlighted the appetite for post-growth thinking across politics and civil society, and the strength of the new youth movement campaigning for change. He spoke about EU green investment plans and how they compare with the Inflation Reduction Act in America.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.asdafoundation.org/">ASDA Foundation</a> event to highlight how Asda impacts on local communities through its 391 community champions who operate across the UK. They focus on local grass roots groups, and have a monthly goods donation budget which they use to support local good causes or help to fundraise. Over £550,000 was donated in 2022. And Asda Foundation awarded £750,000 to support 60 projects across the UK. Asda stores have food donation trollies to support food banks, food waste programmes which donated over 5 million meals in 2022. The champions organised litter picks, chatty cafes, and improved community well-being.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate secured by Dame Meg Hillier MP on <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-06-20/debates/8C2B8255-EEEB-4982-8A67-4C8FCBC62352/Co-OperativesAndAlternativeBusinessesLocalAuthoritySupport#contribution-33F8C2D7-2EC1-437E-A1DF-F353FA28F64A">the role of cooperatives in local authorities</a>. I paid tribute to the co-operators who have encouraged and supported me in my co-operative endeavours over the years – Alun Michael, former MP and PCC for South Wales; members of the Wales Co-operative Council, especially former secretary KC Gordon, who has recently stood down after over 20 years’ service; chair and former Wales MEP Cllr Jackie Jones; David Smith; who has campaigned for many years for the co-operative history of Robert Owen to be included in Welsh Curriculum; Karen Wilkie, former General Secretary of the Wales Co-operative Party, who worked to raise the profile of the Wales Co-operative Party for many years; and former MP Huw Irranca-Davies MS, who has campaigned with me for many years for a UK and Welsh Marcora Law, which gives workers the right and the financial support to buy out all or parts of an at-risk business and establish it as a worker-owned co-operative. Huw and I believe that the future of businesses would be greatly improved with a Marcora-type law. I commended <a href="https://cwmpas.coop/">Cwmpas</a>, formerly known as the Wales Co-operative Centre, for its work since 1982 to build a fairer, greener, economy and a more equal society where people and the planet come first. Cwmpas has been very successfully led by my friend Derek Walker for many years until he was recently appointed the Future Generations’ Commissioner. Cwmpas works with local authorities and other organisations to advise and support start-up businesses, and also provides ongoing support, recognising that this is an essential pilar of economic development in Wales.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the chamber was the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-20/debates/985E7922-AE41-48A6-B007-75F4BF0409C4/Finance(No2)Bill">Finance (No 2) Bill</a> remaining stages. Labour Amendment 1 reinstates the lifetime allowance charge on pensions by deleting clause 18, it was pushed to a vote, and was lost by 192-294 votes. Labour New Clause 7 requires the Chancellor to keep the House of Commons updated on progress implementing the OECD agreement on a global minimum corporate tax rate was voted on and was defeated by 202-296.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice-chair of the APPG for Trade Justice I attended presentations by Dr McNamara and Dr Richardson on the consequences of the UK Government signing the CPTPP agreement next month in New Zealand. After which there will be several months in which the Trade and Agriculture Commission will report on the agreement followed by the GRaG period. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/381/bmj-2022-073302">Dr McNamara had some key messages about the implications of the CPTPP for health</a>, which needs urgent assessment: it contains many of the same provisions that made a potential US-UK free trade deal controversial for public health; it could increase industry influence in setting public health standards, making it more difficult for governments to regulate for health benefits, raise cost of medicines and generate economic insecurity and potential job losses; the UK Government has not conducted a health impact assessment so it needs to listen to public health scholars and professionals. Dr Richardson spoke about the context of the agreement regarding Labour Rights. Parties must: not derogate from or fail to enforce national Labour laws; discourage imports of goods made from forced law regardless of whether from a CPTPP country; maintain fundamental rights defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) as well as national minimum wages, working hours, and occupational health and safety; a Labour Council of government officials will report on implementation, oversee co-operative activities, and receive public submissions; and Parties can request a panel under the agreement’s Dispute Settlement chapter in event of non-compliance which can lead to compensation, fines, or suspension of benefits. The problems are: no external monitoring of compliance with Labour Chapter; government officials have discretion over response to public submissions; the route to dispute settlement process involves sustained government pressure on a CPTPP trade partner, challenging legal terrain, and potentially small economic disincentives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Baroness Maggie Jones to thank her again for taking my Shark Fins Bill through all the stages in the Lords on my behalf, and for an update on its final stage, Report Stage, on 16th June. Then hopefully it will receive its Royal Assent before Parliamentary recess on 20th July.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dwr Cymru held a Parliamentary event to promote its “<a href="http://dwrcymru.com/SupportWithBills">Here for You, Not for Profit</a>” cost of living support stakeholder pack, which sets out supporting the most vulnerable in society, because they don’t want any customers to worry about paying their bills. Dwr Cymru wants to raise awareness of its “Our Here for You” campaign, which helps people pay their bills through social tariffs, debt schemes, plus expert support and advice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Russia and Ukraine APPGs held a joint meeting with Evgenia Kara-Murza, the wife of Vladimir Kara-Murza, Russia’s second highest profile political prisoner and Bill Browder, who introduced and campaigned for the role of Magnitsky sanctions. Evgenia is a pro-democracy activist and has spoken across the world about her husband’s trial, and her activism against the Putin regime. Vladimir is an opposition politician, journalist, human rights activist, and a British Russian dual national. He was convicted for spreading knowingly false information about the Russian armed forces, involvement with an undesirable organisation and treason. He is serving 25 years in a Russian penal colony since April 2023 for this vocal opposition to Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine, which is the longest sentence to date for a Putin critic. Vladimir was poisoned in 2015 and 2019 in Moscow and was in a coma. He could not walk, talk, or feed himself because he’d had a stroke whilst in the coma. Evgenia nursed him back to health and she told us that unlike her husband she is not a politician and was happy working from home looking after their children, but she took up her husband’s work after his detention last year. She is calling on politicians not to let Putin win the war he caused against Ukraine, not force Ukraine to donate part of its territory to the Russia Federation, not allow him to behave like a bully. Tens of thousands of people are being arbitrarily detained in Russia and their stories must be heard. Evgenia said that the Kremlin has its hands full and don’t notice her going around the world campaigning for Vladimir, but she receives a lot of hatred on social media. If her husband survives and the Putin regime collapses, they will want to be part of building a new democratic Russia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.allwynentertainment.com/">Allwyn Entertainment Ltd</a> is the new operator for the National Lottery, and held a Westminster event so that parliamentarians could find out about its ambitions, values, and plans.  I met Anna Mellit, Director of Public Affairs, who told me that Allwyn aims to grow the National Lottery to be bigger, better, and safer, by implementing its social values of raising more money for good causes, and running its own business in an environmentally and socially-responsible manner. Allwyn plans to create new games that are more fun, better value, with more winners, build the best National Lottery team by integrating Camelot employees to take its vision forward, grow a strong supply UK chain, invest in IT, and enhance retail. Anna told me that they believe it’s a “Win for All”.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a vice chair of the APPG for MND, I attended the Global Motor Neuron Disease (MND) Awareness Day 2023. MND is a fatal, rapidly progressing neurological condition affecting more than 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. The disease causes messages from nerves (MD) in the brain and spinal cord that control movement to gradually stop reaching the muscles leading them to weaken, stiffen and waste away. People become locked in a failing body unable to move, talk, and eventually breathe. MND kills a third of people within a year of diagnosis. The MND Association focuses on funding research, improving access to care, and campaigning for people with MND in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There are over 11,000 members which forms a network for people with MND, families and carers to get information and support. On Global MND Awareness Day the <a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/">MND Association</a> sought to highlight the issues and challenges, including accessing benefits, housing adaptations, and the disproportionate impact of the cost-of-living crisis on MND sufferers and their families and carers whilst trying to manage MND.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was an absolute pleasure to meet the courageous Afghan Women’s Development Football team who had played against and beaten the Women’s MPs team. I was honoured to sign a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/20/uk-parliament-calls-on-fifa-to-support-exiled-afghanistan-womens-team">letter to the President of FIFA</a>from UK, Australia, Portugal, and Italy parliamentarians in support of the National and Development teams who have been in exile since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The Taliban immediately banned women’s representation in sports, denying women from national, senior and youth teams to represent their country at international level, in addition to abolishing sports for women at grassroots level. The Afghanistan women’s senior team is in exile in Australia and the development team is in exile in the UK. This year, the World Cup is being co-hosted by Australia, so the time for action is now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Sepsis it was a pleasure to meet Sarah Hamilton-Fairley of <a href="https://sepsistrust.org/">UK Sepsis Trust</a> to finalise arrangements for World Sepsis Day on 13th September. I have applied for a Westminster Hall debate on World Sepsis Day to highlight all the issues and challenges that Sepsis sufferers and survivors face to combat the effects of this serious condition. There is so much that we do not know about Sepsis, and UK Sepsis Trust provide comprehensive support for every person and their families affected by the trauma of Sepsis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was the return from the Lords of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-21/debates/258A03B6-4C90-4CE2-83D9-B0BF35545FF8/Strikes(MinimumServiceLevels)Bill">Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill</a> and we voted on Lords Amendments 5B, 5C, 5D, 4B, and 2B. Lords Amendment 5B would remove the stipulation that Trade Unions have an obligation to ensure that their members comply with a work notice and the responsibility to do so. 5C and 5D are consequential on 5B and will protect trade unions from having to undermine their own otherwise unlawful strikes, and will also remove an employer’s recourse to secure injunctions to prevent trade unions conducting a strike that has been legally balloted. The UK Government voted to disagree with all Lords Amendments – 5B/C/D was defeated by 280-214; Lords Amendment 4B was defeated by 277-209; Lords Amendment 2B was defeated by 283-205.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Official Opposition Day debate was on the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-21/debates/C94A8B18-2565-4AF4-9204-6DC455FDB268/AnimalWelfare(KeptAnimals)">Kept Animals Bill</a>. The UK Government tabled an amendment and the opposition parties did not participate in the vote. Their amendment was won by 262 to 0 votes (253 Conservatives, 2 former Conservatives, and Jim Shannon DUP). The Official Opposition moved their motion to a vote, and lost by 256 to 183 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG Rail in Wales held its AGM and I was honoured to be re-elected chair. The APPG will be holding another event in September with all the railway stakeholders that operate or will be operating in Wales – GWR, Grand Union, Network Rail, Avanti, Transport for Wales, the Global Centre for Rail Excellence, plus Professor Mark Barry, Rail Minister Huw Merrimen MP, Shadow Rail Minister Tan Dhesi MP – to update APPG members on services, infrastructure, and future plans they each have to improve rail transport all across Wales and interconnecting border travel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the APPG on Compassion in Politics, chaired by my friend Debbie Abrahams MP, to meet, listen and question, one of the Democratic Candidates for the 2024 US Presidential elections, <a href="https://marianne2024.com/">Marianne Williamson</a>, who spoke about the challenges presented to US and UK democracy and the choices ahead for those who want to save it. Marianne provided frontline insight into US politics. She has written 13 books, including 4 New York Times Bestsellers and in the 2020 elections she was the most Googled candidate in 49 of 50 states, and received 4th most attention on Twitter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I joined my dear friend Baroness Anita Gale at the <a href="http://activewales.org.uk/">Active Wales Conference</a>. Anita is its President, and I have had the honour to have known Anita for over thirty years. Chair of Active Wales, Cllr Barry Stephens, opened the conference. The guest speaker was another friend, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Care, Julie Morgan MS, who spoke about the challenges facing the over-sixties and the support provided by Welsh Government. The conference delegates and branch officers discussed health, transport, digital exclusion, TV licences, and many other issues facing the elderly in Wales. Anita made the closing remarks and the attendees stayed for an afternoon of entertainment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few weeks, my <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-06-29/debates/8AD2CB57-7BC3-43F9-945D-E16373A503C5/BusinessOfTheHouse?highlight=shark%20fins#contribution-DA7A1EBA-4B3A-43C0-A2B9-2B0527EB4BC1">Shark Fins Private Members’ Bill has successfully passed</a> through all its stages in the Lords and last week received its Royal Assent to become an Act of Parliament. My gratitude to Baroness Maggie Jones for taking it through the Lords on my behalf, and to all its supporters, particularly Bite-Back Shark Conservation, The Shark Trust, and Shark Guardian. It’s not often that a backbencher has the opportunity to make law, and my Bill to ban the practice of catching live sharks, cutting off their fins to sell in the global market, and returning the sharks to the ocean to die barbarically by suffocating or bleeding out, gained cross-party support in the Commons, the Lords, and the UK Government supported it through all its stages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed meeting old friends and making new friends at Party in the Park, which was held in Victoria Gardens. It was a pleasure to be with Neath Town Councillors, Sheila Penry, Jan and Alan Lockyer, Bob Price, and Lauren Heard to meet and chat with families and individuals enjoying the wonderful displays in the lovely sunshine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was a privilege to welcome Huw Merriman, UK Government Minister for Rail, to visit the <a href="https://www.gcre.wales/">Global Centre of Rail Excellence</a> (GCRE). I invited Huw to visit the GCRE when he responded on behalf of the UK Government to my Westminster Hall debate on Rail Infrastructure in Wales, in which I spoke extensively about the potential and my privilege to be involved in the creation and development of the GCRE since its inception many years ago. The GCRE is a purpose-built site for world class research, testing and certification of rolling stock, infrastructure and innovative new rail technologies. Nowhere in Europe will offer the range and breadth of services provided by GCRE. The 700-hectare site is the same size as Gibraltar and has the potential to offer significant commercial opportunities in complementary areas such as: renewable energy, hydrogen and battery; communication innovations such as 5/6G and spectrum testing; carbon capture projects such as space for up to half a million trees; on-site training in partnership with Further and Higher Education. Huw was given a comprehensive briefing on the history and progress of the GCRE before being given a tour of the site so that he could experience the vast potential of this unique facility that is scheduled to open next year.</p>

			<p>Oldham East and Saddleworth MP Debbie Abrahams marked World Wellbeing Week this week by calling for people’s wellbeing to be a key objective of Government, and not just economic growth.</p>
<p>The theme of 2023’s world wellbeing week is anxiety.</p>
<p>Before being elected as the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Ms Abrahams was a public health consultant focusing on health inequalities and Chair of an NHS Trust.</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams MP said:</p>
<p>“World Wellbeing Week is a chance for policymakers to reflect on the centrality of wellbeing in policy decision-making. For too long, policies have chased economic growth at all costs, without considering the importance of the wellbeing of people. Most importantly, we must focus on the equity of this wellbeing – being working 3 jobs while still being poor, cold and hungry will clearly not contribute to people’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>“This year’s theme is anxiety, which is particularly relevant given last week’s rise in interest rates. Constituents across Oldham East and Saddleworth have been in touch with me to express their anxiety about the impact of this on their household finances, and how for many this has increased their anxiety.</p>
<p>“The World Wellbeing Movement has set a challenge to Governments but also local authorities, businesses, schools and individuals to think ‘beyond GDP’ as a success measure, and to look at what gives us fulfilment and enjoyment – our relationships, our green spaces and so on. I hope you can join this movement to a greater enjoyment and fulfilment.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Nottingham Labour is very pleased that the castle has re-opened today Monday 26th June. On Exec Board meeting we announced that the re-opening of the castle would take place in June and we are delivering on our promise.<br>We have announced a new general admission price of £12 per adult, allowing people to return as many times as they like for a year, along with free entry for up to three accompanied kids aged 15 and under. This is in response to the rising cost of living, which is a serious problem for many of our communities, and will ensure that all families in Nottingham can once again access the castle.</p>



<p><br>We are also proud to be opening the castle with an exhibition to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Windrush in cooperation with Museumand and the National Caribbean Heritage museum and to recognise the massive contribution of the Windrush generation and their descendants on our city’s society and economy.<br>Today the reopening of the castle, was marked by Robin Hood and a merry band of local schoolchildren storming the gates, reclaiming the castle for the Nottingham people. Lots of people benefited from a special £1 ticket for the opening day to make our popular heritage site to all.<br>The opening will include access to:</p>



<ul>
<li>the newly reinvigorated Brewhouse Yard that showcases life of Nottingham through the ages from the 1500s to 1900s,</li>



<li>the launch of ‘70 Objeks &amp; Tings,’ to celebrate Windrush, brought to one of the Museum’s temporary galleries by Museumand (The National Caribbean Heritage Museum)</li>



<li>a series of artist commissions and interventions on display around the museum, by Jemisha Maadhavji and Tim Fowler.</li>



<li>A visitor centre and café at the entrance</li>



<li>Access to the Robin Hood and Rebellion Galleries</li>



<li>Use of the land train for the first time after a few years</li>



<li>a Hood’s Hideout adventure playground in the dry moat for children to enjoy</li>



<li>access to the caves- Mortimers Hole and King David’s dungeon for £5 per person</li>
</ul>



<p>We will develop a programme of events, exhibitions, gallery talks and school visits, and offer the site for events such as weddings and corporate functions to ensure that the castle provides a wide range of activities for all to enjoy in the months and years ahead.</p>

<p>The City Council’s Portfolio Holder for Leisure, Culture and Planning, Cllr Pavlos Kotsonis, said: “We are thrilled to reopen Nottingham Castle for the people of Nottingham and for visitors from beyond the city. The castle belongs to the city’s residents and to all our diverse communities and it gives me great joy to be delivering on the promise made for a June reopening.</p>



<p>“We worked hard to achieve this in such a short time and we are looking forward to seeing people reconnect with a site that is so important to local people and to the city. We feel sure that the reinvigorated offer available will encourage many people to come back time and time again, with the new ticket allowing people to pay £12 once and visit all year round!”</p>

<p>Our fantastic Space Park is bringing together our world leading university research with business and industry in state of the art facilities. It aims to create 2,500 high skill, high paid jobs and generate £750m for the wider East Midlands economy.</p>
<p>Last week I helped host a “Leicester West Secondary School Takeover” day. &nbsp;We put on a series of events and talks to inspire students from Babington, Beaumont Leys, Castlemead and New College to think about pursuing a career in the space sector including in engineering, science, IT, data and design.</p>
<p>It was an absolutely amazing day and I am so grateful to the Space Centre for helping to put it on!</p>

<p><strong>As many people die from preventable hip fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes, Judith Cummins MP has revealed.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking on Tuesday in the House of Commons, Bradford South MP Judith Cummins called on the Government to step up its game on bone fracture prevention and save lives.</p>



<p>Judith has been vocal on the issue of Osteoporosis, which affects half of all women and a fifth of all men over 50. It is characterised by a loss of bone density, leaving people vulnerable to breaks and fractures. Because symptoms often aren’t noticed until a serious break, osteoporosis has been called the ‘silent disease’.</p>



<p>Raising the issue in Parliament, Judith highlighted the shocking reality of the condition:</p>



<p>‘Many of these will be serious hip fractures, and as many people will die from these fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes.’</p>



<p>Questioning the Minister, Judith asked why such a serious condition is so often overlooked in healthcare:</p>



<p>‘Can the Minister explain why not even one of the 63 key performance indicators set by NHS England for Integrated Care Boards sets a target for fracture prevention?’</p>



<p>Responding, Maria Caulfield MP, Minister for Women’s Health Strategy, thanked Judith for her longstanding work on bone health. The Minister also highlighted measures the Government is undertaking to tackle Osteoporosis:</p>



<p>‘NHS England is expanding fracture services for higher risk women who do have Osteoporosis to prevent falls in the first place.’</p>



<p>Despite the Government’s claims to be stepping up fracture services, the limits of the current services mean that 74,000 preventable fractures will occur over the next five years, costing the NHS £665 million.</p>



<p>Making fracture prevention a key performance target could lead to stronger delivery of these services, preventing unnecessary pain, giving patients the level of care they deserve, and saving vital NHS resources.</p>



<p>Following the exchange, Judith said that Government support for fracture prevention was still inadequate:</p>



<p>‘Whilst Bradford offers a trailblazing service for those with Osteoporosis, this is not always the case nationally.’</p>



<p>‘The argument for investing in the prevention of fractures is clear: To save money and save lives, we need a government with the sense to invest in the future of women’s health in this country.’</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>

<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudy.email/app/uploads/1684233937.JPG" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking after the visit <strong>Matt Warman MP commented</strong> ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith</strong> who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<br />
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.<br />
<br />
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.<br />
<br />
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.<br />
<br />
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.<br />
<br />
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.<br />
<br />
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.<br />
<br />
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.<br />
<br />
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.<br />
<br />
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.<br />
<br />
We have a historic debt of honour to them.<br />

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br />
<br />
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br />
<br />
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br />
<br />
Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br />
<br />
<i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br />
<br />
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br />
<br />
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br />
<br />
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br />
<br />
