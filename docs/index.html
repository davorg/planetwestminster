			<p>Yesterday, I took part in a Long Covid debate secured by my colleague Layla Moran MP.  It&#8217;s important that we recognise that we need a societal not just a healthcare response to Long Covid. Working age people with Long Covid must be provided with support by their employer and the Government through the Department for Work Pensions and not stigmatised.</p>
<p>You can read my speech in full below.</p>
<p class="hs_Para"><em>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) on securing this very important debate.</em></p>
<p class="hs_Para"><em>It is understandable that in the middle of the covid pandemic, the focus has been on primary prevention and managing the symptoms of those who become infected, but given that, as has already been said, the covid tracker survey suggests that more than 4 million people—about 12% of the population—have symptoms beyond the acute phase, which typically lasts just four weeks, with one in 10 having symptoms beyond 12 weeks, we also need to develop healthcare management responses that recognise that covid can have effects way beyond that acute phase. On top of that, we need an appropriate societal response to long covid, where people are supported during their illness and do not feel stigmatised. That is incredibly important.</em></p>
<p class="hs_Para"><em>I am pleased at the speed with which NICE has brought forward its guidelines for managing long covid. I particularly like the recommended holistic healthcare approach when assessing patients with symptoms between four weeks and 12 weeks, and after 12 weeks, with the emphasis on empathy and acknowledging the impact that the symptoms may be having on the patient’s day-to-day life, including their ability to work. However, I was surprised that there was no reference to immunology or immune therapies. I hope that we have learned from the mistakes made in how we prevent, treat and care for people suffering with chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as ME, and post-viral syndrome.</em></p>
<p class="hs_Para"><em>We know that covid-19, like other viruses, attacks multiple systems—respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal—as it attacks epithelial cells, which are distributed throughout the body, but our body’s ability to fight the virus depends on our immune system reacting appropriately and not overreacting. The British Society for Immunology and a number of other researchers have suggested that, in addition to long-term damage to multiple organs, the pain, muscle weakness, fatigue and even brain fog often associated with long covid may be due to inflammatory issues associated with our immune system itself rather than covid.</em></p>
<p class="hs_Para"><em>There is still so much we do not know about the virus, and I support calls for more research, as well as for the establishment of a disease register. More research is needed, and I am a strong advocate of evidence-based medicine, but it is important that we never let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</em></p>
<p class="hs_Para"><em>Finally, we must ensure, as I mentioned, that we have a societal response, not just a healthcare response. Working-age people in particular must be supported by their employers and by the Government, through the DWP. We must ensure that adequate support is provided to those with long covid who are not able to work. Stigmatising those with long covid should not be tolerated.</em></p>

<p>A contributor asked for an update on government debt.</p>



<p>The UK had a difficult borrowing problem in the IMF crash of the mid 1970s when the country ran out of foreign currency to borrow and had to make emergency cuts. The IMF   supervised a programme of lower public spending in return for loans. </p>



<p> It had a bit of a domestic borrowing problem in the 1980s as a Conservative government tackled the large inherited borrowings. Interest rates rose to high levels to persuade people to take state debt as investments.  As spending came under better control so rates came down, helping economic recovery. </p>



<p> It had a worse borrowing problem during and after the banking crash of 2008. State debt was high going into the crash alongside very high levels of private  sector borrowing. Both sectors reined in in the last months of the Labour government. The incoming Coalition, contrary to media reports, raised the levels of state borrowing over their tenure. </p>



<p>On each of these occasions debt interest was over 3% of GDP or  6-7% of total public spending. It was considerably higher immediately after the war when state debt was 250% of GDP reflecting the need to spend and borrow to win the war. Patient work  brought the debt under better control in the 1950s.</p>



<p>People ask me if we can afford the sharp build up in gross debt brought on by the policies chosen to deal with the pandemic. I am pleased to report that we can afford it, because interest rates have tumbled so much and because the Bank of England is buying in substantial quantities of the debt. The latest official predictions show net debt interest as a percentage of GDP falling to a tiny 0.8% of GDP next year as debts are rolled over at low rates and as the Bank completes its buying programme. This means debt interest will be at its lowest for the post 1945 period. There is no need to count the interest paid on the debt owned by the Bank of England, as taxpayers and government get that receipt. </p>



<p>The Uk government today can borrow money for 10 years at 0.29%. The stated debt is a large 105% of GDP, but the state itself will  own £875bn of that so the true figure for the actual net debt owed by the state is around two thirds of GDP.</p>



<p>These are unusual times when the US, UK, leading EU countries and Japan can all borrow at around zero very large sums of money. It is still not a good idea to go on borrowing at scale for too long, and never  a good idea to waste money borrowed. The immediate need for high borrowing is necessary to subsidise people and companies that are prevented from working by lock downs. The sooner we can unlock, the sooner we can get our finances under better control. </p>



<p>The good news is there is no need to worry yet. Markets are allowing all the major countries to borrow plenty at ultra low rates of interest, underpinned by Central Banks buying up a lot of  the debt. This only has to change were inflation to pick up, which so far it has not. Japan has been doing this now for several decades with  no inflation, with gross state debt at 250% of GDP but net state debt around half that and the interest burden very low. </p>

<p><br>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has written to the UK Prime Minister following Boris Johnson&#8217;s acknowledgment of the difficulties faced by the Scottish fishing industry as a result of his Brexit deal.</p>



<p><br>Commenting, Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP MacNeil said:</p>



<p><br>&#8220;I have contacted Downing Street following the Prime Minister&#8217;s appearance at the Liaison Committee where he talked about compensation. I am hearing from the fishing industry who are telling me scallop fishing has stopped, prawn boats are also tied up, white fish prices have crashed, and we know from DFDS that they are not taking any consignments to the continent for yet another 5 days.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;At the route of all this is people&#8217;s jobs, in processing and on boats, who are affected by this and affected badly. This situation is a catastrophe. </p>



<p><br>&#8220;The Republic of Ireland has been promised €1.051 billion in help from the European Union, as a result Irish politicians have been commenting about the result of it &#8216;consistent solidarity&#8217; from the European Union towards Ireland, in what is even for them a difficult Brexit process. <br></p>



<p>&#8220;For us in Scotland, the Brexit process is far far worse than anything Ireland is facing. The best we have had so far is to share a £100 million between England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a tenth of what Ireland alone is getting. It is time for the UK Government, who have caused this situation, to up their game and make sure that billions are coming into Scotland, particularly the Highlands and Islands which are the worst affected area in Europe due to Brexit. </p>



<p><br>&#8220;People&#8217;s lives should not be damaged because of the choices of Tory Westminster, Scotland clearly needs to be independent, the damage being done by being in the UK is very much on our doorsteps right now.&#8221; <br></p>

<p>South Lakes MP Tim Farron has written to DEFRA Secretary George Eustice urging him to intervene after local fishermen were told they will no longer be able to sell to their biggest market for the next four months.</p>
<p>Fishermen in the South Cumbrian village of Flookburgh earn much of their living by harvesting cockles and mussels from Morecambe Bay and selling them to France.</p>
<p>However, since January 1<sup>st</sup> they have been told by DEFRA officials that the Government has not got the proper paperwork in place for them to carry on selling to France, and the latest advice on the Government's website says that the matter will not be resolved until April 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>In his letter to the Secretary of State, Tim said: <em>"I am sure you will agree that this is unacceptable and l request that this is urgently resolved and all affected fishermen are communicated with as soon as possible and are offered every assistance, especially as their normal income has fallen off the cliff edge with no warning and most have families who are reliant on a regular income to survive."</em></p>

<p class="xmsonormal">If Family Fortunes asked one hundred people for things that they associate with the first national lockdown, I think that sunny weather would have been right up there with toilet roll shortages, Zoom calls and clapping for our carers. Being cooped up inside all day with only an hour allowed out in the sunshine for exercise in the local area gave many people a new appreciation for the green spaces around them.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">The weather this time is very different, but I still see many people out and about enjoying (in a responsible and socially-distanced manner) the parks, woods and open spaces of Tameside. We are lucky to have some really great green spaces, including Haughton Dale and Hulmes Wood Nature Reserves and parks like Victoria Park in Denton, Ryecroft in Audenshaw and Dukinfield Park. Also on our doorstep, we have Reddish Vale Country Park in the Stockport part of my constituency.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">I am very pleased that more and more people are discovering these fantastic local spaces and this just reinforces the need to protect them and the environment more broadly. That’s why I’ve been so adamant about opposing the extension of the Bredbury Industrial Estate into the precious greenbelt land of the Tame Valley. Being in an urban area, our green space is more limited than it might be otherwise and we need to protect what we’ve got.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">But it’s not just about keeping parks and nature reserves open, we need to think more broadly about our environment. One key element of this is cleaning up our air. Whilst we have move on a lot from the smoke-filled photos of years gone by, that doesn’t mean that we aren’t facing serious problems with pollution, which in turn has a very negative impact on public health. Russell Scott Primary in Denton have been trailblazing on how air quality can be improved in and around schools, improving both the health and education of children. We need more innovative thinking like this.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">I have a long list of things I’d like to see when we come out of this pandemic – better pay and conditions for key workers, an end to food poverty, proper funding for local councils and public services, and so on. Right up there, though, is a greater focus on the environment both locally and nationally. I believe we can all work together to see a greener and healthier Tameside when we leave Covid behind.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">Local MP Robin Walker has praised the volunteers at Worcester Talking News for their work over the past year to help blind and visually impaired people stay in touch with local and national news. The charity, based at Colin Chance House in Worcester, has existed since 1978, and their work has been particularly valuable over the past year as many people have been forced to stay at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Volunteers at Worcester Talking News provide regular recordings of current affairs and community news stories. In addition to this, they host a large collection of audiobooks which service users are able to borrow free of charge. They also offer advice and signpost to other services available to assist people who are blind and visually impaired.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Robin has previously visited Colin Chance House to meet the volunteers and has provided a recording so that listeners could hear a report directly from their local MP. Robin said:</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Worcester Talking News has been a great tool for people who are blind or visually impaired since it began over forty years ago. Without their sight people can understandably feel isolated from the rest of the community, but this resource ensures regular access to news and current affairs.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Coronavirus has added to everyone’s feeling of isolation, including people who are blind and partially sighted. That is why the service Worcester Talking News provides is more important now than ever. The service is only possible thanks to the committed team of volunteers who deserve praise for their work which improves lives in Worcester and the wider area.”</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>Philip Dunne MP for the Ludlow constituency today confirmed his understanding of the rollout of the COVID vaccination programme in South Shropshire.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In a statement released today he confirmed: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“South East Shropshire Primary Care Network was chosen to pilot community vaccination some two weeks before Christmas as soon as the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine became available. This has gone well with strong cooperation and support from all nine GP practices and a majority of residents over 80s are expected to have received their first dose vaccine by this weekend. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The vaccination programme in the South West Shropshire Primary Care Network area around Ludlow has been underway with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for those in Priority Group 1 (care homes and NHS staff) sequentially since 2nd January. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I am assured by NHS leaders in Shropshire that the programme for Priority Group 2 (over 80s) will commence <span>on 25th Januar</span>y as supplies of the vaccine become available. Vaccination pods will open at Ludlow Racecourse and local residents across South West Shropshire will be contacted by their medical practice by email or letter to be offered a date and time to attend. Please do not contact your GP, they will contact you. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If vaccine supplies are maintained as planned, the programme is expected to complete all care homes in South Shropshire by the end of next week, all Priority Group 2 (over 80s) by the end of January and all Priority Group 3 (over 75s) and Priority Group 4 (over 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable) by mid-February. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I know there has been frustration that vaccines have not been deployed earlier. This has been due to logistical challenges in supplying the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine to such a large and sparsely populated geography as the whole of South West Shropshire through a single hub. As more vaccine becomes available and with the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine requiring less challenging handling practices, it is now possible to deploy with all the very willing vaccinators and volunteers from the GP surgeries and others in the area. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>GP practices will be in a position to administer the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine much like they do the flu vaccine, since it can be transported more readily and has a shelf life of 6 months in a fridge whereas the Pfizer BioNTech has only a few days use following removal from freezer storage at -70C which made it very difficult to deploy for mass vaccination in a rural setting. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I also have to add that there has been some most unhelpful commentary and speculation suggesting the vaccines would not be available to reach the top four Priority Groups until the end of March. I have been assured by NHS leaders in Shropshire responsible for the vaccination programme that this is wrong and inappropriately misleading for local residents. I am appalled to learn that anyone should be stoking anxiety by spreading such ill informed speculation at this difficult time.” </span></span></span></p></div>

<p>From helping over 80,000 people stay active during lockdown, to reducing the sugar levels in its drinks, a new report highlights how Suntory Beverage &amp; Food GB&amp;I is helping consumers live active and healthy lifestyles.</p>



<p>In 2020, SBF GB&amp;I’s promotion of healthier lifestyles continued at pace, with the owner of Lucozade and Ribena helping 80,000 people stay active during lockdown.</p>



<p>Furthermore, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SBF GB&amp;I has supported disadvantaged 16-24 year olds with the provision of online sports sessions and mental health/outreach support to those struggling to cope as part of its ‘B Active’ sport-for-development programme.</p>



<p>Shadow Health Minister Alex Norris MP welcomes the company’s work: “Talking obesity must be a major national priority, it leads to long-term health conditions, limits opportunity and, as we&#8217;ve seen over the last year, makes us vulnerable to other diseases.”</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m glad to see the work that Suntory is doing and call on all of industry to do its bit,” says Mr Norris.</p>



<p>SBF GB&amp;I’s work throughout the pandemic is just part of its wider ‘Growing for Good’ vision which seeks growth in tandem with corporate social responsibility.</p>



<p>As well as inspiring more than 1.5 million to be more active through its “Made to Move” programme, fronted by Anthony Joshua, the company has delivered more than 238 tonnes of drinks to national food redistribution network FareShare since 2016.</p>



<p>Responding to SBF GB&amp;I’s achievements, Rt Hon Mark Harper MP said: “Suntory is an innovative company that has shown a vote of confidence in the UK post-Brexit with significant investments in my constituency and elsewhere in the country – showing their commitment to our country’s bright future and our talented workforce.”</p>



<p>SBF GB&amp;I’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lrsuntory.com/health-and-wellbeing/report/"><em>Moving on Health and Wellbeing Report 2019-20</em></a>&nbsp;shows a strong focus on empowering the communities in which it works and to whom it sells.</p>



<p>Chief operating officer Carol Robert says: “Just as everyone should have access to free exercise, we believe that everyone should have access to food and drink.”</p>



<p>Robert continues: “The vision captures our ambition to continue growing as a company, and to help build a better, healthier and happier society as we do so”.</p>



<p>Further work last year included bolstering the production capacity of its lower-sugar drinks with a £13 million investment in its factory and delivery of 107,000 cases of drinks to NHS frontline workers and vulnerable adults throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p>But it is the company’s efforts in spearheading a reduction in sugar levels in its drinks that has earned the company plaudits from politicians on both sides of the aisle.</p>



<p>Former Public Health Minister Steve Brine MP, who visited the company’s research and development lab in Uxbridge, says the decision to alter “beloved” recipes “raised eyebrows” among competitors, who were “likely rubbing their hands over what they presumed to be the outcome”.</p>



<p>“But it was an incredibly brave thing to do, taking some of the best-known brands in the market, Ribena, Lucozade, and turning them on their heads,” Mr Brine continues.</p>



<p>“They showed themselves to be ahead of the curve on what most other manufacturers have followed and have produced equally good products that are good for us, and good for business… Suntory really is one of leaders in this, and one of the pioneers on a mass scale.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, the move led to some really good staff relations within the company from people who wanted to work for a company pushing an agenda in such an enlightened way.”</p>



<p>Since the decision was first made in 2016, sugar content in SBF GB&amp;I’s drinks has been cut by 57%, achieving an average sugar content of 3.7g per 100ml, and a pledge that no new core drinks with sugar contents exceeding 4.5g per 100ml will be launched.</p>



<p>Responding to this move, Mark Harper MP said: “It was really encouraging that Suntory led the industry responding to the Government’s sugar tax, showing what was possible and successfully adapting to a changing regulatory environment.”</p>



<p>Having made progress on reformulating its core brands, the company says it is now turning its efforts to launch healthier choices to an ever-more health-conscious consumer.</p>



<p>Several new Lucozade brands were launched last year, with Lucozade Revive leading the way, which the company says provides a gentler uplift than other energy drinks on the market and contains just 4.3g of sugar per 100ml.</p>



<p>John Penrose, MP for Weston-super-Mare where the blackcurrants that make Ribena are processed, says: “Cutting the amount of sugar in hugely-popular family drinks like Ribena, without losing any of the flavour, is an easy way for all of us to live, eat and drink more healthily.</p>



<p>“That’s good for levelling up because trimming our waistlines reduces health inequalities, so more of us stay healthier and live longer too, no matter where we started from.”</p>

<p>Local MP for Beverley and Holderness, has echoed clinicians’ calls for patience as the long-anticipated Covid-19 vaccine continues to be rolled out across the East Riding of Yorkshire, after seeking updates on the progress of its distribution</p>
<p>The UK’s independent regulator, the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has now granted approval to three different vaccines shown to be effective against Covid-19 in clinical trials – the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are already being distributed to hospitals and GP practices across the country, while deliveries of Moderna doses are expected in the spring.</p>
<p>All seven Primary Care Networks (groups of GP surgeries) in the East Riding are now live vaccination sites, following news that Holderness Health had been chosen as a hub in December. In Beverley and Holderness, vaccines are being administered from Church View Surgery in Hedon, while Beverley PCN has begun vaccinating from Beverley Racecourse.</p>
<p>Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust is also administering the jabs, using the Pfizer vaccine – which must be stored between -80°C and -60°C – to reach NHS and care home staff as well as those over the age of 80. Meanwhile, GP surgeries are leading on immunising care home residents and other housebound patients using the Oxford vaccine.</p>
<p>Graham said, “Vaccines are key to exiting these restrictions and returning to a semblance of normality, so I can understand why people are so keen to see their friends and loved ones get the jab as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“But I think the key message at the moment is for people to be patient and not add to surgeries’ workloads by phoning up to ask when you’ll be getting yours. This is the biggest vaccination programme in the country’s history, so it’s impossible to fit everyone in within the first few days alone. Especially with the Pfizer vaccine, because of its storage requirements, GPs only have a short period of time in which to take delivery of the vaccine, book vulnerable patients in, and administer it before it expires.</p>
<p>“I contacted both the NHS Trust and the Clinical Commissioning Group to see if there was anything I could do to help at a political level, and I was very pleased to hear that vaccination sites in the East Riding are working hard to ensure that every last drop is being used to protect people from this terrible virus.”</p>
<p>Over 2.6 million Covid-19 jabs have been given out to people in the UK as of 12th Janaury, with around 200,000 doses a day being administered at current rates. Government data indicates that over one-third of people aged 80 and over have received their first jab.</p>
<p>Graham added, “The UK has vaccinated more people than anywhere else in Europe – but the programme is still in its early stages. It’s only going to get better as more of the vaccines become available and more hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies join up.”</p>

As early as 30 October 2018, I asked the Foreign &#38; Commonwealth Office, “what assessment have the Government made of extremely alarming reports of internment camps for Uyghur Muslims in China?”. This afternoon, the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, detailed the Government’s response to forced labour in Xinjiang.  The evidence of the scale and severity of the human rights violations being perpetrated in Xinjiang against the Uighur Muslims is extensive and harrowing. The Foreign Secretary confirmed these violations include: The extrajudicial detention of&#160;over 1 million Uighurs and other minorities [&#8230;]

<p>Ahead of the Nottinghamshire Local Government Pension Fund  AGM, Deputy Leader of Nottingham City Council. Cllr Sally Longford, has called on the fund to ensure the long term sustainability of the Fund and play its part in addressing climate change by divesting from fossil fuel to more sustainable, low carbon and renewable investments.<br> <br> The Pension Fund covers over 300 members including Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, the District Councils and many other organisations who are generally non-profit making, or are undertaking a service which was, or could be carried out by the Local Authority. It is controlled by County Councillors and the City Council has no voting rights on the Pension Fund.  Interested parties are able to submit questions to the AGM though which Cllr Longford has done on behalf of City members of the scheme<br> <br> Currently Nottinghamshire Pension Fund holds at least £170m in fossil fuel company shares and has no investments in sustainable, low carbon or renewable energy equity funds. Divestment from any fossil fuel related investments is part of Nottingham City Council’s <a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/media/2619917/2028-carbon-neutral-action-plan-v2-160620.pdf">Carbon Neutral Action Plan</a> which is aiming to make Nottingham carbon neutral by 2028.<br> <br> Outlining her argument at January Full Council, Cllr Longford said “We know that the primary responsibility of the pension fund is to protect the financial benefits of the scheme, and now that there is growing evidence that fossil fuel investments are performing less well than comparators it is the time to grasp the divestment nettle.”<br> <br> “Over 1300 institutions worldwide have committed to divestment, including at least 10 UK local government pension funds and a large number of UK universities and faith organisations and so I have submitted a question to the Pension Fund AGM asking them to agree to consult with its members on a divestment strategy and timeline before the next AGM, in order to ensure the long term sustainability of the Fund and to play it’s part in the prevention of catastrophic climate change.”<br> <br>The Pension Fund is set to have its AGM on 21<sup>st</sup> January.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p>Good news but please be patient.</p>



<p>Thanks to Hywel Dda health board for sharing with us today plans to share as much of the vaccine as they can get hold of ASAP. </p>



<p>Great that Wales &amp; Hywel Dda have received their fair share, &amp; you’ll have given 8,416 vaccine doses by this weekend, &amp; expect to get 4,000 Pfizer and 2,800 Oxford by next week, but understand that the main roll-out of the vaccine to our 45,000 over 80s and health / care workers will be from 11th January. Then it will be all systems go ……. </p>



<p>Please make sure you are registered with  GP, and you will get your invitation. But also please remember the vaccine takes time to be effective and gives no guarantee you will not pass the disease on to others. </p>



<p>In the meantime, please stay at home unless you have to go out. </p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">Hard-working volunteers with the Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company have pulled another iron from the fund-raising fire – a £9,300 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to take the project to a new level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Part of the cash will be used to create a digital guide to the history of Neath Abbey – including not only the world-famous ironworks but the impressive remains of the Cistercian monastery close by.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">And with open days, guided tours and personal presentations all off-limits while the corona virus pandemic continues, digital outreach has become an essential tool in raising awareness of the project by allowing people to visualise the ironworks at its world-beating peak – when it powered the industrial revolution of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Data will be posted on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and People’s Collection Wales, creating a virtual guided tour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">In addition, new interpretive panels at the ironworks will explain the history and function of the various structures and buildings on site.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The remainder of the money will be used to renovate an old BT telephone kiosk – which cost £1 – and convert it into a heritage centre at the nearby Longford housing estate where local people can, via a display book and works of art, discover the area’s history.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The artworks will be created by children of the local Dwr y Felin Comprehensive School. Other community groups such as Bryncoch Environment Group, Dyffryn Clydach Community Council, Dyffryn Clydach and Bryncoch Historic Group will also display community news, events and information in the kiosk.<a href="https://www.christinarees.org/?attachment_id=2344"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2344" src="https://www.christinarees.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8DCDF1DF-42F0-4CD0-97E0-3676E4E7186B-560x297.png" alt="" width="560" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:560px;max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Last week I spoke in the Westminster Hall debate entitled <strong>Future of fairs and Showgrounds</strong>. I wanted to support those showmen and women here in South Shields which has a long history of welcoming traveling showmen and women that dates back almost 100 years. It is imperative that the Government stops ignoring the fairground and showmen community and steps in to provide vital support before it is too late. As a longstanding supporter and advocate for show people and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fairs and Showgrounds, I will continue to be a voice for this community and press the Government at every opportunity for better support and recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the outset of the pandemic, many fairs were either cancelled or postponed – from summer fetes to Christmas Markets. As a result of the closures and postponing of fairs, many show people suffered huge financial loss, plunging them into financial insecurity.</p>



<p>The heart of the issue is that the financial support offered to the tourism industry during COVID-19 continually excluded the fairground community. Showmen and women also did not qualify for the assistance announced in the recent budget for retail, leisure and hospitality firms relating to business rates in the coming year, due to the way that the Show people operate, which falls outside the scope of static leisure providers.</p>



<p>Show people across the UK and particularly those here in South Shields, now face losing their businesses and livelihoods if the UK Government does not step in.</p>

<p>2020 has left us with many legacies as we’ve coped with a set of circumstances none of us would have imagined. As we look to the light provided by new vaccines and as we approach a new year, there is yet another nasty legacy sting in the tail of 2020 – a rise in feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p>Research from Age UK has shown that this Christmas is set to be the loneliest yet for older people. Over 160,000 people over the age of 65 will suffer from feeling lonely this festive season, with nearly 60% of them fearing that they won’t see any family and friends. Those are heartbreaking numbers, even one person feeling like this is one too many.</p>
<p>Our communities can carry another more positive legacy from 2020. The Age UK research also highlighted that over 100,000 older people were helped to get through the pandemic by the kindness of strangers. The simple act of checking on people made a life-enhancing difference for so many, we can never know for sure, but it’s probably safe to assume that in some instances, it was life-saving.</p>
<p>Of course, loneliness and isolation don’t discriminate; young people are also affected. The Office of National statistics were able to point out that, during the first month of the pandemic, 7. 4 million people, across the nations of the UK said that their wellbeing was affected through feeling isolated.</p>
<p>We all knew that these restrictions were essential to protect lives, but the collateral effect was, as predicted, substantial. Recently, we have become more aware of a problem that has existed for some time but rarely brought into public debate. Work undertaken for the charities MIND and Mental Health UK confirmed that young people are particularly affected by loneliness.</p>
<p>During the pandemic almost half of 18-24-year-olds experienced, and those aged 25-34 are twice – yes twice – as likely to be lonely at Christmas than older people. That’s a lot of lonely people out there feeling isolated.</p>
<p>While we cannot visit indoors, there are many other ways we can help people feel less isolated. Given that a third of people are too embarrassed to admit that they are lonely, it is small acts that make a difference; it might be a note through the door or a phone call to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. Simple offers of contact, help with shopping, a chat a few steps back from the doorstep could mean a big deal to reassure folk that they are valued and to feel a little less alone.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&nbsp;UK&nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’</p>

<p>Today in Parliament I pressed the Health Secretary Matt Hancock for answers on how the roll-out of an approved COVID-19 vaccine is likely to affect our lives and when it might be completed.</p>
<p>I will continue to intervene in debates to ensure the government carefully review the progress of the vaccine, and we can look safely towards an end to social distancing.</p>
