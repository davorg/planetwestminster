            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p><strong>We voted for Brexit because we once again wanted to live in an independent country. We want our laws and taxes settled in Parliament by MPs that we can vote out of office if they do not please. Elections empower voters to get change. A sovereign Parliament can do what it takes to promote the freedoms and prosperity of the British people.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>In 2019 we had to vote again to get Brexit through owing to the obstructions of all too many MPs. The voters showed they knew the way to get their will done by removing many of the MPs who were thwarting Brexit. Now we are legally out of the EU the government needs to do more to exercise the Brexit freedoms we have gained.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>There have already been some good wins from exit. We  no longer have to make large contributions to the EU. As promised NHS spending has increased, by  more than the savings from Brexit so far. We no longer have to accept the accumulating debts and liabilities of the EU. Since we left the EU has started to borrow large sums in its own name to spend mainly in the financially stressed  countries of the Union. All that debt becomes a burden on the taxpayers of all  the member states, the only source of money to pay for it.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Out of the EU we were able to pursue our own vaccine and covid strategy, getting to a vaccine earlier than the EU and allowing us to get out of lockdown before many continental countries. We are pressing ahead with different approaches to the regulation of science and medical advance, to assist in the development of UK excellence in those fields like gene editing. Faced with a shortage of drivers over lockdowns, we were able to flex our regulations temporarily  to help solve the problems. We cancelled VAT on female hygiene products and suspended it on green investments for five years.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The wild pessimism of Remain forecasts for the economy did not come true when we voted to leave. We did not see a rise in unemployment, a fall in house prices, a rise in interest rates in 2016 on the vote nor in 2020 on departing. Our trade with non EU countries is expanding, and we have completed a series of new trade deals with non EU countries. We may well soon join the  very large Trans Pacific Trade Partnership,something we could not do as members of the EU.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>We have been able to rebuild old valued friendships and alliances. The UK damaged important ties with Australia, New Zealand and Canada on joining the EEC. Today we are building a wider relationship on the back of our 5 Eyes Intelligence grouping and with new trade and investment links  possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Many of us are far happier now we are out. We are impatient to show more Brexit wins by changing laws and repealing taxes the EU imposed. Our happiness resides in the knowledge that our Parliament can  now make the right decisions and laws for us if it wishes, and we can change the Parliament if it refuses. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a week in Westminster can be momentous, some days even infamous &#8211; last week was something else!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the Tories passed a bill that was nothing short of an attack on workers&#8217; rights, specifically the basic right to withdraw labour in disputes. They were happy to clap nurses, but now they want to make it easier to sack them. Families in every community are struggling to put food on the table or heat their home because of the direct actions of this UK Government&#8217;s handling of the economy but instead of apology and support, they are looking for scapegoats.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday came, and with it, an attack on democracy and devolution. The UK Government chose to weaponise legislation passed by two-thirds of MSPs to flex its muscles over Scotland&#8217;s Parliament and seek to create a diversionary culture war.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed things couldn&#8217;t get much worse by Wednesday, but we still had the Retained EU Law bill to debate. Hundreds of you wrote to me to share your dismay at the contents of the bill, and these are concerns I very much share.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The sunset clause in this bill means that fundamental rights will be scrapped automatically if not first identified and replaced by the end of the year. Do you trust this Government firstly to have the competence to review thousands of pieces of legislation by the deadline and secondly to make decisions in the interest of the public rather than their donors, cronies and chums.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This UK Government seems intent on destroying hard-fought rights and legislation that protects those who need it most. They also seem determined to undermine devolution at every turn as they attempt to impose more and more direct rule.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s easy to forget how different decisions taken by the Scottish Parliament impact us every day. Just imagine if Westminster made all the choices?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;d be paying for every prescription, you&#8217;d be paying bedroom tax, we&#8217;d have fewer doctors, nurses, and police officers. Untreated sewage would be allowed to run into our rivers and coastline, just for a start. The list goes on, and it is long.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Make to mistake, this UK government is only getting started – they know they&#8217;ve lost voters because of the mess they have made and so are doubling down on their right-wing credentials to stoke division, and it is the most vulnerable who are left paying the highest price.</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has labelled the Government’s levelling-up agenda a ‘total scam’, after a new report laid bare the scale of regional inequality.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/uk-levelling-up/rishi-sunak-relaunch-government-funding-pledge-2023.html">Bloomberg’s 2023 Levelling Up Scorecard</a>, it was highlighted that since 2019 – when the Tories promised to ‘level-up’ neglected regions across the UK – inequalities have widened and key prosperity indicators have fallen.</p>
<p>Across Denton and Reddish, it was revealed that local people have seen their salaries, access to affordable housing, life expectancy and broadband coverage all fall or remain the same since 2019. The report also shows that overall Government spending has declined in the local area.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/levelling-up-fund-slammed-final-26017588">Gwynne slammed the Government</a> after Tameside Council’s levelling up bid to transform Denton Town Centre was rejected. Rishi Sunak’s own constituency was awarded funding, leading to accusations of favouritism being levelled at the Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“These findings reinforce what we’ve long suspected, that Tory levelling up is a total scam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Government explicitly promised that they would level up swathes of neglected regions across the UK, but instead they’ve actively made things worse – it’s shameful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Conservatives have been in power for 13 years, and we’ve nothing to show for it except lower salaries, worse living standards and skyrocketing bills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We need a General Election, and a Labour Government that works in the interests of local people”.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ministers will never deal with the record waits for NHS treatment until they stop older people being stuck in hospital because they cannot get decent social care in the community or at home.</p>
<p>Yet after 13 years of the Conservative Government there are now 540k people waiting to have their social care needs assessed &amp; reviewed. Ministers haven’t got a plan to sort this crisis and to stop people ending up in hospital when they don’t need to be there.</p>
<p>I called on the Government to put this right today in Parliament.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h3>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>In Parliament last week, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron called for urgent action to prevent sudden unexpected deaths in children.</p>
<p>During a Parliamentary debate, Tim spoke of a constituent who sadly lost their two-year-old son, Wilfred, as a result of complications caused by a febrile seizure. Wilfred had suffered from febrile seizures throughout his life which had not been investigated seriously.</p>
<p>Speaking in Westminster Hall Tim said: <em>"I spoke last night to my constituent Charlotte and her husband Andy regarding their little son Wilfred, who was two years and 10 months old when he died a little over a year ago.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Charlotte and Andy refer to Wilfred as a 'vibrant, energetic little boy who had a vivacious and fearless lust for life'. She goes on to say, 'The shock that reverberates into every aspect of your life when your child dies unexpectedly and suddenly is unimaginable'.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Unimaginable it is to those of us who have not personally experienced that tragedy. As I seek to honour Wilfred, perhaps the best thing that I can do is speak briefly about actions that could spare other families from experiencing the grief and tragedy with which Wilfred's family continue to live."</em>
</p>
<p>Tim called for a pathway for NHS Trusts which would allow them to deal with children who suffer febrile seizures and investigate the source of the issue.</p>
<p>Tim also made reference to the charity 'Cardiac Risk in the Young' (CRY) who carry out cardiac screenings of young people at schools in the North West of England: <em>"Thousands of people have been assessed by Cardiac Risk in the Young, which is a wonderful charity that works across the North-West and further - indeed, it has done sessions in Kendal.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"I encourage the Minister to look into how we can screen young people particularly if there is any family history, to ensure that we do not lose them to undiagnosed heart conditions."</em>
</p>
<p>This is important work as, due to their age, young people are often not screened for heart conditions even if they have an extensive family history of cardiac issues.</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim said<em>: "This is a devastating issue that we have to be doing everything in our power to combat.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"To experience the loss of a child and have that loss left unexplainable must be prevented at all costs. NHS trusts should be granted the resources that would allow them to investigate febrile seizures in infants and young people.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Furthermore, we must continue regular screenings of young people for cardiac issues so as few parents as possible suffer such utterly tragic unexpected bereavement."</em>

<p><em>Martin led a Backbench Business Debate in the House of Commons on the arbitrary detention of his constituent Jagtar Singh Johal (19 January 2023). Here is the opening speech transcribed from <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-01-19/debates/D6F2F3B1-FF9E-4E3A-9958-4335CB2568E1/details#contribution-C41BE501-82C9-4311-A23C-5A1F3DDFBB0F">Hansard</a>…</em></p>



<p><strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes MP (SNP, West Dunbartonshire): </strong>I beg to move, that this House has considered the imprisonment of Jagtar Singh Johal.</p>



<p>Let me begin by thanking the Backbench Business Committee for allowing this debate to proceed today. I noticed, while going over my notes in preparation, that it is almost a year since I first submitted the request, yet the Committee has indulged my requests to delay owing to the changing circumstances of the case. I think it was more in hope than expectation that my friend, the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns), offered me the slot last week, and I am delighted to see them in their place today, as well as other members of the Backbench Business Committee.</p>



<p>I do not intend to spend much time today going over the specifics of the case. These are a matter for the public record, following: the Adjournment debate that I was granted in November 2018; the Westminster Hall debate of June 2021; and, indeed, the urgent question heard by the House in September last year. Indeed, in the five years since Jagtar’s arrest, I have brought up his case on the Floor of the House on more than 30 separate occasions. This, along with the excellent work of my colleagues from other political parties across the House who have continued to raise my constituent’s case in parliamentary questions.</p>



<p>The engagement across parties in debates and in meetings with Ministers shows the strength and durability of the feeling in this place to address what is becoming one of the most—at least I would say—prominent injustices in modern UK foreign policy. That is, essentially, the purpose of this debate. Through the speeches and interventions made in the House today, I want the Government to see: that Members across this House, across parties, and across the nations of these islands, have no intention of forgetting Jagtar Singh Johal; that the choice that they made not to deem his continued detention an arbitrary one until recently to not be without consequence; and that even five years on, we will be here, and for another five years if that is indeed necessary. Once again, we ask them, through the Minister, to call for his immediate release.</p>



<p>The United Kingdom Government are, of course, not the only relevant party: the Government of the Republic of India, their judiciary and their police forces are the ones who continue to hold my constituent in a fashion that is consistent with arbitrary detention. I would like them to watch this debate and recognise that this has not escaped international attention and nor will it do so.</p>



<p>Last May, when the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention submitted a report on the case, it could not have been clearer. It said:</p>



<p><em>“Mr Johal’s arrest and detention are arbitrary…as there is a lack of legal basis or justification, and amount to unlawful abduction, incommunicado detention and unreasonable pretrial detention.”</em></p>



<p>It continues that <em>“none of the domestic or international law requirements was complied with during Mr Johal’s arrest. Mr Johal was bound, hooded and taken by unidentified police officers. During that time, Mr Johal was never informed that he was being arrested, nor was a family member with him. Under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, no person is to be deprived of life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”</em></p>



<p>We subsequently heard last year, following the excellent work of the charity Reprieve, that this arrest was almost certainly the result of intelligence shared by the British Government. There is, of course, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Steven Bonnar), an ongoing legal case. I hope we will one day be able to establish the circumstances that set this terrible personal tragedy into motion, although it would save the family the stress of the court process if the UK Government were to be up-front about their role in the case as soon as possible—but I am afraid I do not think that will happen.</p>



<p>We are here one week before 26 January, when India celebrates Republic Day and marks the 73rd anniversary of the constitution’s coming into force, effectively heralding the culmination of a long and often bloody struggle to create the modern Indian state out of the unjust and rapacious reality of British colonial rule. Standing in this Chamber, within this Palace constructed partially with the proceeds of the wealth extracted from India during the colonial period, every one of us must be mindful of so much when addressing the actions of the Indian Government, as I hope I have always been when referring to this case.</p>



<p>The Republic of India is a great state—indeed, it is more than that; it is a great civilisation. During my Adjournment debate in November 2018, I ended with an appeal that, transparency, due process and the rule of law be upheld in this case. The course of time has certainly not altered those sentiments, but it allows us to reflect on whether they have been upheld. I am afraid that not only do I, the majority of hon. Members present, the Johal family and countless legal experts hold the view that transparency, due process and the rule of law have not been upheld in Jagtar’s case, but so does the United Nations.</p>



<p>In the week before Republic Day, I made a plea to the Indian Government, and the judiciary, which is quite correctly independent, to reflect on the preamble to the great foundational document of the Republic of India that they will celebrate next week. Let us recall the words:</p>



<p>“JUSTICE, social, economic and political;</p>



<p>LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;</p>



<p>EQUALITY of status and opportunity;”</p>



<p>and then of course:</p>



<p>“FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the Unity and integrity of the Nation.”</p>



<p>Those are fine words, befitting a great global state, which, if trends continue, stands to become a great global leader of the 21st century, but that will require not only economic might and demographic advantage but translating great sentiments into great actions: fair and open institutions that have the trust of the people.</p>



<p>This week we saw Jagtar’s case again adjourned until March due to witnesses not being presented, just as it was in November, and those more well-versed than me in Indian legal matters think it could continue to be adjourned at eight-week intervals for some time. If the prosecution cannot produce witnesses, they are not only wasting everyone’s time, but wasting the best part of my constituent’s life.</p>



<p>Goodness knows we still have our problems with institutions on these islands, but that should never stop anyone or any political state striving to be better. In that spirit of self-reflection, I will bring my remarks to a conclusion by asking the Minister to think about changing their strategy. Neither the family or I doubt the commitment of the Government to raise this often and at the highest levels; yet here we are, five years on, having seen very little movement in the case. Indeed, only one of the nine cases involving Jagtar has advanced in any meaningful way. The current approach simply is not working.</p>



<p>When the then Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson), conceded in a letter to the Leader of the Opposition that it was the Government’s view that Jagtar had been arbitrarily detained, the family and all the many people interested in Jagtar’s welfare naturally expected that that would be followed by action from the British Government. We know that the Government have called for the release of UK citizens arbitrarily detained abroad: will they now do so for Jagtar?</p>



<p>I hope by the time we hear from the Minister—maybe rather quicker than we hoped—we will have an answer to this straightforward question and others that will be brought forth by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber. With miscarriages of justice such as this, it is often some time before victims and families see action; when we are seeing one continuing to take place before our eyes, then we must redouble our efforts to stop it. I put it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the Government can do their bit too.</p>



<p>That is the spirit of this debate. I look forward to hearing the voices of those who contribute, and they have the gratitude of the Johal family. I hope their voices will echo not just across the road to King Charles Street, but across the globe to India. We will not give up on Jagtar. It is time to set him free.</p>

<p>I started the week celebrating the Samaritans Brew Monday. This was a chance to enjoy a cuppa and a catch up with friends and colleagues in Parliament. It was excellent to meet with Samaritans volunteers to hear about the work they have been doing and to learn so much more about how people often just call them to talk and share. Please remember how important it is to share with someone.</p>
<p>It’s important that we take the time to pause, put the kettle on, and have a chat with those around us. It’s too easy to ask, “How are you?”, receive the answer, “Fine, thanks,” and to move on. Sometimes we need to ask more and make it clear that we have the time and the willingness to listen and care. Saving lives cannot wait – the Government have to take action now. As a society, we need to start listening.</p>
<p>The news that serving Met police officer David Carrick commited dozens of rape and sexual offences has shocked society and caused anger at vetting procedures and code of practice. I have previously taken part in the police service parliamentary scheme with both the Metropolitan police and the Avon and Somerset police. During that scheme, I joined police officers going into the homes and situations of the country’s most vulnerable people, overwhelmingly women. That women cannot be confident about police officers is abhorrent. In some of the worst situations that you can imagine, women must be able to trust police enough to reach out for help. The Home Office needs to get a grip, ensure that proper vetting procedures are in place, and that the culture within the police changes so that monsters like Carrick cannot get away with committing such heinous crimes.</p>
<p>This week the UK Tory Government triggered Section 35 of the Scotland Act following the passing of the Gender Recognition Reform Act by the Scottish Parliament. I’m proud that the last Labour Government secured devolution via the Scotland Act, and also passed the Gender Recognition Act and the Equality Act. It’s vital that these laws work with each other in harmony. This means we need to have a grown-up discussion on how we achieve this. This is now looks set to be debated in the courts.</p>
<p>The second issue that is related to the above is that this serious and complicated debate is not being held in the respectful and calm way the issues warrant. It is not acceptable for people who stand up for women’s rights and who raise legitimate concerns about the fears of women to have their safe spaces removed to be constantly badgered, attacked, and treated as bigots. We, of course, have to ensure that transgender people are supported and protected in law. This is a complete mess created by the UK Tory Government and SNP Scottish Government playing party politics over the rights of individuals. We must ensure that rights are balanced and not made enemies of each other.</p>
<p>Parliament also focussed on two important laws this week. The first is technically known as the EU (Retained Law) Bill. But would better be described as a Whitehall power grab. All laws passed by British MPs, whilst we were members of the EU to ensure everything was compatible, will be scrapped in one fell swoop under this Bill. Not only is this unworkable – many public bodies have said as much – it will see the biggest move of power from you to the Government. I can see this causing so much chaos and confusion for Bristolian businesses and individuals. What’s being advertised as a bonfire of red tape is likely going to spread and set fire to things we desperately need to keep. </p>
<p>The second Bill Parliament focused on this week was the Online Safety Bill. It’s clear for all to see that social media has become a Wild West when it comes to bullying, discrimination and harassment. There are very few levers of accountability and this must change. The Bill is a missed opportunity to right many wrongs. It has achieved the seemingly impossible of both letting social media giants mark their own homework and grant the UK Government unprecedented powers to determine what you can and can’t see. The ‘legal but harmful’ clause is so vague it will allow a minister to determine content not acceptable in the UK when it’s perfectly fine. Freedom of expression campaigners are seriously concerned and so we should. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to hear that Filwood Broadway has received over £14.5 million in funding. It will be used to build more homes, community and business spaces in the heart of Knowle West. Our high streets and local areas outside the centre are the beating heart of our cities – they are where we raise our families, where we spend time with friends, where we shop and eat. Levelling up areas like this is vital for improving outcomes across the city and for helping everyone raise their families in safe and pleasant environments. </p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you concerning a couple of local issues.</p>
<h2>ULEZ</h2>
<p>Firstly many of you will be aware that the Mayor of London has decided to widen London’s ultra low emission zone from later this year. This has significant implications for our area.</p>
<p>I won’t get into the politics of this now, except to say that I am strongly opposed to the change at this time because of its impact on our area, on pensioners and people on low incomes with older cars and most significantly those seeking treatment at St Helier or the Marsden. I have asked him to reconsider this aspect of the scheme in particular.</p>
<p>But I thought that I should give you a picture of what the change means for us locally.</p>
<p>The first thing to say is that the plan does not include extending the zone right to the London boundary everywhere. For us the outline ULEZ map says it will not cover the route from Epsom to the M25 via Malden Rushett or from Ewell to Tolworth and the A3 going southwards. There has been some confusion over the status of Rushett Lane and I am checking that with TfL.</p>
<p>It will also not include the north end of Stoneleigh and parts of Worcester Park.</p>
<p>Full details of the plan and what cars are included are here, together with Transport for London’s map of the new extension.</p>
<p><a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ulez-expansion-2023"><strong>https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ulez-expansion-2023</strong></a></p>
<p>The target date for the launch is August 29th, though that may slip as some councils are refusing to work with the Mayor to install the cameras that will be needed to make it operational.</p>
<h2>Epsom &amp; Mole Valley Local Plans</h2>
<p>There have been two new developments on the Local Plans which shape the future of housing development in our area – in Epsom and Ewell and Mole Valley.</p>
<p>Epsom and Ewell Borough Council is due to publish its draft plan in the next few days, and this will show the degree to which it has decided to push for development on local green belt land. I very much hope they have chosen to focus on brown field sites and particularly on the potential for the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas.</p>
<p>If you have not previously seen my proposal for the area, you can find it on my website page <strong><a href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/shaping-the-right-plan-for-epsom-and-ewell-a-proposal-from-chris-grayling/">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I will include links on my site to the Council’s local plan documents when they are published. Please do take part in the public consultation. This will affect us all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Mole Valley, the Council has asked the Planning Inspector to delay consideration of their plans, following the Government’s revision of its national planning policies. It is too early to know if this may affect the plans for Ashtead, but I will keep you posted.</p>
<h2>Energy Support Scheme</h2>
<p>Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Energy Support Scheme. In total we have raised about £45,000 and this is being used by the Good Company, which runs the food bank, and Citizens Advice, to help people struggling with high bills this winter to deal with short term problems with their bills and to buy low energy appliances. I am really grateful to all who have contributed.</p>

<h2>Epsom Citizens Advice</h2>
<p>Finally a word of congratulation to Epsom and Ewell’s Citizens Advice team for putting together a very good financial awareness training programme for local sixth formers, which has been trialled initially at Epsom and Ewell High School. This is a really important area, and hopefully other schools locally will be able to benefit soon as well.

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p>Dunne welcomes Health Secretary, Steve Barclay’s announcement that over £200m will be invested in supporting discharge of patients from hospitals across the UK. This will relieve pressure this winter and has been provided to integrated care boards for immediate use.</p>

<p>A further £50m has been allocated for the creation of modular units in hospitals which will help free up bed spaces – meaning ambulances can get back onto the road sooner to deal with emergency one calls and enabling faster response times.</p>

<p>The announcement means £1.7m has been provided to Shropshire NHS Integrated Care Board to help facilitate the new national discharge process to reduce risk and improve patient safety. This in turn will increase capacity to discharge patients and create improved flow in acute hospitals in Shropshire and Telford.</p>

<p>Funding for Adult Social Care will contribute towards four weeks of a new extended care package following discharge for patients who no longer meet in-patient criteria. Additionally, clinical advice or therapeutic will be available where appropriate in step-down facility to help patients with recovery, reconditioning and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>The Government is running a national campaign to recruit extra staff needed to support more packages of care. The £500m social care discharge fund announced last September can be used for the recruitment and retention of the care workforce. A further £15m was set aside to further boost overseas recruitment opportunities.</p>

<p>Commenting on the update, Philip Dunne said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Government recognises current winter pressures on the NHS and is helping the NHS deal with discharge some 10,000 elderly patients who occupy beds, while medically fit for discharge. Fixing the link between discharge and after care, whether in social care settings or at home, is imperative.</p>

<p>“I am glad the Department for Health is using medical advances like virtual beds, artificial intelligence, and better analytics to better understand the use of time between admittance and discharge.</p>

<p>“This should help with the delays to ambulance response times and patient handovers as it will improve patient flow through our acute hospitals”.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last night, the Government announced that Bradford had not been successful in its levelling up bid to regenerate the Odsal area of Bradford South</p>



<p><strong>Speaking in Parliament in response to the announcement, Judith asked:</strong></p>



<p>“Would the Minister agree with me that the British people have an innate sense of fair play?</p>



<p>“Independent analysis of the largest cities and towns in England identified Bradford as the UK’s number one Levelling Up opportunity – given that none of the four Bradford bids were successful in this round – does the Minister believe that the people of Bradford will think this is a fair outcome, or indeed that this process stinks?”</p>



<p>Responding, Lucy Frazer MP, Minister for Housing and Planning said:</p>



<p>“As I mentioned earlier, as somebody who grew up in Leeds, I understand how important that area of the country is, and how much more we can do. We were only able to allocate in this round £2.1 billion, but there is further funding available and Levelling Up Round 3 will be coming in due course.”</p>



<p><strong>Speaking afterwards, Judith said:</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;This is yet another example of this Government leaving Bradford and West Yorkshire behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is hugely disappointing that Bradford&#8217;s ambitious £50m levelling up bid to regenerate the Osdal area has not been successful. The transformative plan would have brought significant investment and hundreds of jobs in to Bradford.</p>



<p>It is a damning indictment of this Government&#8217;s lack of vision and support for Bradford when not one of the city&#8217;s submitted bids in this round was successful.”</p>



<p>Judith added: “This is not the government levelling up, it is the government messing up. The government needs to fix the process to ensure fairness, so that public funds are targeted to places that would benefit the most like Bradford.”</p>

<p>When will this government address the problems of damp and mould in housing, so starkly revealed by the coroner’s findings in the tragic death of two-year-old Awaab Ishack?</p>



<p>I’m horrified at the condition of properties which constituents of mine, with young children, are being forced to live in. It reminds me of the BBC drama <em>Cathy Come Home</em>, a play which shocked a nation and resulted in the charities Crisis and Shelter being established and the 1969 Housing Act.</p>



<p>After 13 years of Tory government our housing situation is as bad today as it was in 1969. The rogue landlords, who exploit temporary and exempt accommodation, are every bit as wicked as the Rachmans of the 1960s. They’re on a get-rich-quick, gravy train, making money out of homeless and vulnerable people.</p>



<p>Last week I sat on the Committee Stage of a Bill designed to tackle some of the worst excesses of exempt accommodation, a problem I’ve been raising for several years. It’s aimed at those ‘mini hostels’ springing up all over Birmingham which destroy family homes and threaten local communities. It allows for licensing, a fit and proper test for landlords, and a power to restrict the concentration of such hostels in local communities. They’re all things I called for in my own Bill two years ago, which the government refused to back. In the intervening period things have got much worse.</p>



<p>Latest figures show 3.4m homes in England failed to meet the decent homes standard and about 164,000 rented dwellings are affected by damp. It’s worse in private rented homes, where more than 10% have damp and 23% fail to meet the decent homes standard.</p>



<p><em>Cathy Come Home</em> forced action from the government of the day and last week a small number of MPs made a little progress, but there’s been no corresponding response from this government to Awaab Ishak’s death. Instead, our PM has abandoned the target of building 300,000 homes per year, making homeless people more dependent on temporary accommodation, while cynically switching resources from deprived areas, where housing issues are most acute, to well-heeled Tory shires.</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Nottingham Labour is disappointed that Nottingham City Council has not been successful in three bids for funding from the Government’s Levelling Up Fund. These bids were for:</p>



<ul><li>The £20m Broad Marsh bid&nbsp;to prepare the frame of the derelict shopping centre to be retained and reimagined as a unique space for play, performance and food.</li><li>The £20m Bulwell town centre bid&nbsp;was to create a&nbsp; Bulwell Promenade with enhancements of green space and public realm alongside the River Leen. It also included improvements to the marketplace and the restoration of heritage buildings and easier access and better connectivity between Bulwell Bogs, the tram stop, bus station, the market place and high streets.</li><li>The £17m Island Quarter bid,&nbsp;submitted on behalf of developers Conygar, focused on renovating three heritage warehouse buildings at the heart of the 36-acre site near to Nottingham Station as well as improving access for pedestrians, cyclists and vehicle users with an upgraded junction connecting the site to the Sneinton community.</li></ul>



<p>All three bids put forward a strong case for national funding to help regenerate areas of the city in a way that was progressive, clean, green and sustainable. Nottingham City Council officers worked hard on putting forward these bids, which clearly fell under the scope of the Levelling Up Fund.</p>



<p>The Levelling Up Fund is about making the country more equal, giving increased amounts of funding to areas that have been overlooked or not received their fair share in the past. Cities like Nottingham should be the prime targets for the fund. Under the current Government, this is not the case.</p>



<p>The rejection of all three bids does not make any clear economic sense. Cities are the drivers of the economy, they draw in people from suburbs and towns to work, to study and to relax. The Broadmarsh and Island Quarter bids would have created jobs, built new homes and revived the city centre. Not only that, but they would have helped the transformation of one of the entrances to the city, into a green and welcoming area, an area that would be modern and innovative. The Bulwell bid would have helped regenerate one of the more economically-deprived areas of the city, enhancing and improving the marketplace and area alongside the River Leen.</p>



<p>Nottingham needed this funding, but instead it went to places like Rutland, somewhere that would be difficult to describe as deprived or needing more money for improvements. Indeed, it seems as though economic sense was not the key driver of the decisions around which bids were successful. When looking at the areas that received funding, more often than not the local MP is Conservative. This is one more example of the Government making decisions based on political benefit instead of what will benefit people who need help the most. The most damning evidence of this is that of the 80 successful bids in England only half are in the 100 most deprived parts of the country.</p>



<p>This is made even more obvious by the fact that Prime Minister Sunak’s own constituency of Richmond in Yorkshire had a £19 million successful bid, while the nearby city of Leeds was unsuccessful.</p>



<p>It is clear then that the decisions for funding were political decisions. Despite this disappointment, work will still be able to start on the Green Heart, and the first phase will be completed. The new Central Library will be completed this year, improvements are currently ongoing to Bulwell Bus Station and Conyger is continuing work on the Island Quarter.</p>



<p>Nottingham Labour will continue to work and push for improvements and funding for Nottingham City. More Levelling Up funding will become available and bids will be submitted. Nottingham Labour is committed to seeking all available funding to help Nottingham residents and to help improve and grow our city.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil says Scotland has been utterly conned by the UK Government as Levelling Up Funding is announced today (Thursday).</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has been informed by the UK Government that local applications to the Levelling Up Fund &#8211; which was marketed as the replacement to EU funding lost through Brexit &#8211; have been unsuccessful.</p>



<p>The applications submitted by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar were for ‘Eilean Siar Spinal Route &amp; Connecting Infrastructure’ and the ‘Eilean Siar Cultural Heritage and Regeneration Project’. Both projects would have brought major benefits to Na h-Eileanan an Iar through transport upgrades and cultural projects.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “It is a huge blow for Na h-Eileanan an Iar to miss out on funding for these two projects. I know this has involved a huge amount of work from Comhairle staff.</p>



<p> “Since Brexit, we have lost EU funding which contributed a lot to development over decades. EU structural funding was about £3.5m a year &#8211; Tory Brexit is short-changing the islands with less than a third of the money.</p>



<p>“The UK Government gave assurances that Brexit would not lead to a loss of money to rural areas. &nbsp;However, now we see the magnitude of that lie with today’s announcement that the Comhairle’s bids to the Levelling Up Fund have been unsuccessful.”</p>



<p>Scotland’s share of the Levelling Up funding is just £177 million out of £2 billion.</p>



<p>Around £1.1 billion out of the £1.6 billion total levelling up funding in England has been given to areas with a Conservative MP.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil he added: “People have been utterly conned by the UK Government and their Brexit. If ever there was a time for Independence, it is now.”</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Today I joined Alzheimer’s Society Ambassadors Vicky McClure and Dame Arlene Phillips as well as Elliot Colburn MP and Ananga Moonesinghe, who lives with dementia, to deliver an open letter to PM Rishi Sunak at Downing Street, demanding the Government urgently fulfil their promises on dementia.</p>
<p>Launched by leading dementia charity Alzheimer’s Society, the open letter has been signed by over 36,000 members of the public and famous names including Choreographer Dame Arlene Philips and actor Vicky McClure. We were joined at the hand-in by my colleague on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, Vice-Chair Elliot Colburn MP, showing cross-party support. It urges Rishi Sunak to deliver on previous Conservative Party commitments to dementia and not let the UK’s biggest killer fall down the political agenda.</p>
<p>Previous Conservative Prime Ministers have actively committed to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. Now Rishi Sunak must deliver on promises to reform social care, double dementia research funding and release a ten-year plan for dementia which gives the condition the priority it deserves. The 36,000 people who signed the open letter are making themselves clear &#8211; they don’t just want to hear empty promises, they want to see action. People with dementia can’t and won’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates still sitting below pre-pandemic levels, national figures reveal people are waiting up to two years in some areas for a diagnosis, thereby missing out on vital treatment and support. Alzheimer’s Society research also shows three in five people affected by dementia struggled to get social care in the past year, with half of family carers revealing they ended up in crisis, such as rushing their loved one to A&amp;E due to lack of support</p>
<p>The charity is concerned the deepening workforce crisis in social care – with vacancies sitting at 165,000 – risks leaving people with dementia desperate for help while living costs soar. Alzheimer’s Society say it’s more important now than ever for the Government to prioritise dementia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Government has made many commitments on dementia, promising to deliver a ‘visionary ten-year plan’ for dementia, to reform the social care system and double spending on dementia research by 2024.  Alzheimer’s Society says the delivery of these will be transformational for the lives of the 900,000 people living with dementia but calls on the Government to urgently make these a reality to prevent a deepening crisis in dementia care.</p>
<p>This follows the news last year that a new drug, lecanemab, was shown to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this breakthrough will mean little if diagnosis rates remain stagnant and often inaccurate. This treatment works best for people with early Alzheimer’s disease. Without early and accurate diagnosis, we risk hopeful advancements like this having minimal effect.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Boston Borough Council has successfully secured £14.8m from the Government Levelling Up Fund to kick-start regeneration and secure further investment to the heart of the town centre. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">The Levelling Up Fund is specifically designed to secure capital investment in infrastructure that has the potential to improve lives and give people pride in their communities. Boston&#8217;s Rosegarth Square masterplan, forming part of PE21, seeks to revitalise and repurpose the area between the River Witham and the bus station – particularly focusing on the area of the former Dunelm/B&amp;M building and the vacant Crown House building.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">A new public park, spanning the area between the river and the Len Medlock Centre will provide a new place for people. New green spaces, improved pedestrian routes, artwork and other features seek to create an inviting, safe, accessible and enjoyable place for all, as well as offering significant environmental enhancements. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Alongside this, works to convert Crown House to provide a mix of residential and other uses to support young people and families, will see this building visually improved and positively enhance its presence. </span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Works to demolish the existing B&amp;M building as enabling works to future re-development will also be undertaken; taken together these interventions will improve the appearance of the area and address some local challenges from anti-social behaviour and crime.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In conjunction with the proposed works, a programme of community engagement will be undertaken, including a linked archaeology project, to better understand the history of the site, influence the emerging designs, and link the areas past to its future.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Collectively these interventions are intended to be high-quality, and make significant impact both for the short and longer-term. They will revitalise this large brownfield site and act as a catalyst for further positive inward investment and the regeneration ambition for the area. The aim is to change the character and appearance of this area, create opportunities for new uses and homes, create jobs, support the economy and the community, and create a place where people want to live, work and enjoy.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Securing this level of public investment, supplemented by further match funding, will act as the catalyst for the wider re-development of this prominent, and unique place so that it makes a positive contribution to the area and becomes a place people can be proud of and which complements the setting of Boston Stump and the core of the town centre around the Market Place. It comes on top of Boston Borough Council&#8217;s successful bids to the Towns Fund.</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;"> </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The proposal was initially submitted in August 2022, and the Council will now seek to mobilise quickly to access and draw down the funding from Government and seek to re-engage with our partners to move the scheme on to the detailed design and delivery phases. Further engagement will also be undertaken as the proposals are developed.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Cllr Nigel Welton, Deputy Leader and Portfolio Holder for Economic Growth at Boston Borough Council said: “Since submitting the bid in early August, we have been eagerly awaiting to hear the result – and we are absolutely thrilled to be able to say that we have been successful in our bid, and have been allocated £14.8million from the Levelling Up Fund.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“This is another great example of the public and private sector working together to help bring investment into Boston. This forward-thinking council is focussed on doing all that it can to help improve the economy, create new job opportunities and install a sense of pride for residents in the town. This is an ambitious scheme which we hope to bring real change for Boston for future generations. We want to continually improve the town and help to raise aspirations and this investment will play a key role in that.”</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The funding announcement comes as several regeneration and improvement projects start to take shape in Boston following Town Deal funding from the Government, also part of the Levelling Up agenda. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Historic shop fronts are being renovated as part of plans to attract more investment; improvements at Boston Railway Station are proposed; and other projects to transform the health, wellbeing and education through the Boston Leisure and Mayflower projects all seek to create new opportunities for residents as well as attracting new visitors to the area. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Matt Warman, Member of Parliament for Boston and Skegness, said, &#8220;The government has backed the Council&#8217;s bold, ambitious vision for Boston, and awarded major funding that many other towns were also bidding for. The success of Boston Borough Council in securing their full £14.8 million bid in the face of stiff competition across the UK demonstrates the transformative quality of this comprehensive plan to regenerate a currently neglected and run down part of our town in a sustainable way. Linking with improvements made within the £21.9 million Boston Town Deal, residents and visitors to Boston will see their route through the town renewed with both new high quality building projects and sympathetic renovation and reinstatement of historic features. Council leaders and officers have worked in partnership with government and business to bring contemporary housing, hospitality and retail options within a newly created urban green space. And with every £1 of public money spent here bringing a benefit of £2.80 to our local area as well as creating jobs it’s great value for taxpayers too.&#8221;</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Simon Dancer, Director at AMION Consulting, said: ““This much-needed government investment will enable the regeneration and revival of Boston Town Centre, playing a critical role in levelling up locally.  It will create both a green corridor, as well as a catalyst for redevelopment.”</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Caroline Killeavy, Chief Executive Officer of YMCA Lincolnshire: “The plans for the masterplan area, developed through strong partnerships between the public, private and voluntary community sectors who all have local residents needs in and, are both inspirational and ambitious.   </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“In addition to enabling new quality housing and employment opportunities in the Town, this funding will be used to enable an enhanced quality of life for those who live and work locally. We want everyone to have pride in Boston – it’s a great place to be and deserves this investment.   YMCA Lincolnshire is thrilled to have the opportunity to work alongside such innovative and skilled partners, and looks forward to contributing to the much needed regeneration of this area of Town.”</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Steve Moore, Senior Preconstruction Manager of Willmott Dixon said:</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“I am delighted to hear that South &amp; East Lincolnshire Councils’ Partnership’s LUF2 funding bid has been successful.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“It’s now just a matter of time before the regeneration project becomes a reality, which is hugely exciting for us at Willmott Dixon after supporting the bid. This vital funding will transform the area into a vibrant space, improving access links to Boston town centre and providing more health and wellbeing resources for local people.”</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Council hopes this investment will unlock further opportunities in this area to deliver homes, health-facilities and new employment spaces.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Paul Kelly, Group Development Director at Scarborough Group International (SGI), commented: “SGI has a long-standing relationship with Boston Borough Council as a result of our ownership of a major retail asset located in Boston town centre, which forms a significant part of the PE21 Masterplan.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"></span><o:p></o:p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">“We’re delighted to have worked in partnership with the Council and other key stakeholders to support the now successful bid, which will significantly accelerate the development of this strategic regeneration project, by unlocking the full potential of uses, driving footfall into the town centre and acting as a catalyst for wider investment.”</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP John Penrose is celebrating today&#8217;s announcement that Ministers have approved the town&#8217;s multi-million pound Levelling Up Fund bid for Government cash.</p>



<p><br>In summer last year, John supported North Somerset&#8217;s Levelling-Up Fund bid to turn Weston into a year-round destination by upgrading underused and vulnerable local heritage sites into “must visit” destinations; reinventing the town centre and high street; creating more attractive routes within the town; improving the visitor experience; and encouraging footfall and spending.</p>



<p><br>John said: &#8220;This is brilliant for Weston. The cash should boost investment in local jobs and growth, create opportunities for people who never had them before, and make our town look better for local residents and visitors alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>  Vetoing this legislation is an unprecedented attack on the Scottish Parliament, which passed the Gender Recognition Reform Bill <strong>86 to 39</strong>, including MSPs from every single party.</p>



<p>Gender recognition is a devolved policy area, and this does not change the 2010 Equality Act or give any additional rights to those with a certificate.</p>



<p>It shortens and simplifies the process and particularly ends the requirement for a psychological diagnosis of gender dysphoria.</p>



<p><em>This </em>is in keeping with the guidance from the World Health Organization and UN, which recommends change to a legal statutory process <strong>based on self-identification</strong>.</p>



<p>This change has already been made by many countries over the last decade, including neighbors Ireland, Belgium, Denmark.</p>



<p>But this government is threatening to end UK acceptance of international certificates.</p>



<p>I find it bizarre considering the former Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Member for Maidenhead suggested a similar proposal in 2017.</p>



<p>So can the Secretary of State explain exactly <strong>which parts of the Equality Act </strong>are changed by this bill?</p>



<p><strong>Why did he not raise specific concerns</strong> during the two consultations carried out by the Scottish Parliament, or in response to the Cabinet Secretary&#8217;s letter in October, rather than a response that came three days before the final debate on the bill?</p>



<p><strong>What modifications is he suggesting to the bill</strong> that wouldn&#8217;t include a return to the outmoded medicalized process?</p>



<p>Why is he using one of the most marginalized groups in society <strong>to pick a fight with a Scottish Parliament?</strong> </p>



<p>Is he seriously. Is he seriously, after 300 years of different marriage ages and voting ages, <em>suggesting there can no longer be legal or age differences north and south of the border</em>,</p>



<p>and does he recognize that vetoing this bill simply highlights the <strong>hollow reality of devolution</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Sec of State for Scotland</strong>:  <em>Well, Mr Speaker, uh, the Honourable Lady won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that I don&#8217;t recognize very much of what she said as being correct, and I would point her to, I would point her to the Statement of Reasons, which will be laid alongside this order today, today, today. Which will, which, and it&#8217;s, and, and our legal advice is very clear.</em></p>



<p><em>The Equality Act 2010 is reserved. And there are adverse effects. There are adverse effects, and they will be there in the Statement of Reasons. And I, and, and, and I, I listed some of those in my, in my statement I made only moments ago, I listed them areas around associations, women&#8217;s safe spaces, single sex clubs, single sex schools, et cetera, et cetera.</em></p>



<p><em>It was very clear. It was very clear what I said. And you will see what legal counsel have determined when you see the Statement of Reasons.</em></p>

<p>I have long campaigned for stronger protections for children and the public online. </p>



<p>The Government have made a mess of the Online Safety Bill. Rishi Sunak is so out of touch he’s completely misread the room. There’s a parliamentary majority to strengthen the Bill and ensure company directors are liable for their failures to protect children.</p>



<p>I will be voting today to: </p>



<ul><li>strengthen criminal sanctions for senior managers who fail to make their platforms safe.  </li><li>allow Ofcom to set minimum standards for platforms’ terms and conditions on online harms and hold them to account for changing them on a whim. </li><li>introduce an ombudsman, for better redress for individuals when a platform fails to deal with their complaint. </li></ul>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the funeral of my dear friend Ceridwen Rogers, known as Crid. Many years ago I met Alan Rogers, former MEP and former MP for the Rhondda, and his wonderful wife Crid. We saw one another often from 1983 until 1998, but we have lost touch over the subsequent years. However, I was delighted to meet their daughter Catherine, Acting Principal of NPT College Group, chair of Welsh Netball, and their son-in-law Mark Dacey (married to another daughter, Alison), Principal of Neath College, in 2014 and we have become close friends. Crid was a pillar of the local community wherever they lived all over the world. A socialist, feminist, Alan’s office manager, member of Cefn Hengoed Ladies Choir (who sang at her funeral) and so much more. Gelligaer Church was full of Crid’s family, friends, and members of community organisations. RIP my friend.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the Stonegate Group’s annual investment programme, it has invested £174,000 into the Castell-Nedd Arms in Neath town centre. I was delighted to take my staff to visit and see the improvements. We met with the operator of the pub Kayleigh Strinati, the Group’s area manager Danny Cross, and the bar staff. Kayleigh told us that she had worked in the pub trade for a number of years, and she felt that it was time to take that step up to managing the Castell-Nedd. She completed the training requirements, and then Covid struck. But when the pub re-opened again, the customers gradually came back to what had become a social hub for many people who live in Neath. The new challenge is the “cost of living crisis”, but Kayleigh is providing a very warm welcome for people to gather, talk, listen, watch TV, use the Wi-Fi, as well as great refreshments. The refurbishment includes new windows and seating area overlooking Angel Street, a pool and darts section, and many more facilities.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I visited the Churches Together Nativity Scene which this year is displayed in the Greyhound Trust Charity Shop Window, instead of in the Town Square. It is secure and able to be seen by all passers by. Massive thanks to the charity shop.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I met with Mark Fisher, NPT Council Unison Representative, to discuss Fair Funding for the council. Mark has always done a fantastic job representing Unison members, and although it was announced this week that NPT has received a better than anticipated settlement of 7.1% from Welsh Government, he shared his concerns about pressure on future budgets, and the continuing “cost of living” challenges faced everyday by every one of his members. Mark will be holding a Fair Funding Event at NPT Council for local elected representatives and his Unison members on Friday 13th January 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Mark and I joined the Royal Mail workers who are striking for a fair pay settlement and no diminishing of their terms and conditions, on their Picket Line which was outside the Royal Mail Sorting Office in Neath. There was a great turnout, and many passers-by supported the strike. People were dropping off food to keep the workers going in the freezing, sub-zero temperatures. In solidarity, I bought all the strikers coffee from our superb local coffee shop, Brew &amp; Co.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mynydd Fforch Dwm Windfarm is a proposal by <a href="https://mfdwindfarm.co.uk/about-us/">Naturalis Energy</a> to provide clean, carbon free energy to homes and businesses across South Wales, including a renewable energy park near Tonmawr. Naturalis is a joint venture between Falck Renewables and REG Windpower energy companies. A number of constituents have contacted me regarding the proposal, asking me to call into the one of the Naturalis public consultation sessions. I dropped into the one held at Neath Little Theatre to view the plans and listen to a presentation by Naturalis staff. As part of the Development of National Significance (DNS) planning process Naturalis are required to undertake a comprehensive programme of pre-application engagement consultations. As an MP I have no remit over Welsh Government or Local Authority Planning applications. My role is to pass on the views and concerns of all my constituents to the stakeholders involved in a particular planning application. Please email me and I shall make sure that your questions are passed onto the stakeholders involved in this application.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My brother James was suddenly taken seriously ill and was rushed to Basingstoke Hospital. My daughter Angharad and I visited him in hospital, but James died following his fight against his illness which turned into pneumonia. My big brother was always there to look after me, after the death of my father, when I was seventeen. James was an industrial pharmacist, worked all over the world, and had many friends and colleagues. James was brought up by my grandparents who owned the Walnut Tree Pub in Kenfig Hill. He was a product of Bridgend Grammar School, Loughborough and Cardiff Universities. James organised the old boys network for former pupils of his old school. My grandfather was a founder of Kenfig Hill RFC, and my parents managed the bar. Rugby was part of James’ life, and he was proud to play number 8 at schoolboy rugby for Wales. I have lived with my brother all over the world at various times during my life. He was my mentor, my hero, my rock. I am devastated at the passing of my beloved brother.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Being a member of the congregation of St David’s Church Neath has been a great source of comfort to me. The people who go to my church are genuine, caring, supportive, never forget that life is very challenging, and we are always there to help each other through the good and the not-so-good times. It was so good to see my friends at the Choir Coffee Morning at St David’s Church, Neath. Many thanks to everyone who came to help and support. Coffee, cake, festive music with loyal friends in the beautifully Christmas decorated church.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an honour to be a patron of YMCA Neath and I really enjoyed the Christmas Fayre. There were stalls, arts and crafts, jewellery, face painting, glitter tattoos, pottery painting, tombola, lucky dip, raffle prizes, and refreshments. It was so good to catch up with Centre Manager Claire Hicks, and Admin Officer Jessica Kennedy. As a lifelong vegan, it was good to meet YMCA staffer Rhys Oliver who has recently started her delivery business “Vegan Kitchen – Food with a conscience – Made in Wales”. Rhys was selling a taste of her produce, vegan sausages, pasties, and chocolate cakes. Her menus are changed weekly and are made freshly on the day of delivery. And all packaging is environmentally friendly. Please email Rhys on DaffodilBach@gmail.com or telephone 07947715435 to place your orders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I dropped into The Haven to meet my dear friend Major Mary Wolfe, her successor Major Neil Duquemin, and Skills Coordinator Christina Davies. On the day of my visit, The Haven had provided 48 Christmas lunches to their regular clients, but their door is always open to anyone who wants to call in and have a substantial breakfast for 50 pence, and a choice of lunch for a pound. On Wednesdays, agencies are based in The Haven for the day to offer help and advice, including Citizens Advice, the Wallich, Medical Staff, and Jobcentre Plus. Christina delivers skills courses including “budgeting on benefits”, and “cooking on a limited income”. My heartfelt thanks to Mary, Neil, Christina and all the volunteers who give up their time everyday for the homeless and people in need.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was an absolute delight to meet the winner of my Christmas Card 2022 Competition Caitlin Vaughan, aged 6, and her mother Hannah. Thank you to all the children who sent in their designs. It is always a very difficult task to select a winner, but Caitlin’s card was exceptional for one so young. Special mention for Gorazd Trajkovski from Skopje, Macedonia, aged 10 who won the International Prize.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the last day in the Neath Office, I took my wonderful Neath Office staff for Christmas lunch. This is our first Christmas lunch since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. My I take this opportunity to wish all my constituents a very merry Christmas and a happy, healthy New Year!</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my November&nbsp;email newsletter. The focus is on yesterday&#8217;s Autumn Statement delivered by the Chancellor, with details on what this means for you, but there are also updates on local campaigns and on the ongoing issue of the Channel Crossings.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Autumn Statement:</h1>



<p>Yesterday, the Chancellor delivered the Government’s highly anticipated Autumn Statement. In which he detailed how the Government intends to restore economic stability and tackle inflation.</p>



<p>Like many countries around the world, the UK is facing profound economic challenges. Supply disruption caused by the world’s economies emerging from lockdown has been compounded by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and deliberate interference with Europe’s energy supply to create massive increases in the cost of energy. This has led to high inflation and high interest rates across many of the world’s major economies, and the UK is no different.</p>



<p>I welcome the proposals in the Autumn Statement. To achieve long-term, sustainable growth we need to grip inflation, balance the books, and get debt falling as a share of GDP. The plan presented by the Chancellor yesterday takes the tough decisions to face up to this situation without passing the buck onto future generations. What’s more, it protects the hard-working majority by enacting no headline tax increases, and protects the most vulnerable by maintaining the pensions triple lock and raising benefits in line with inflation – something I have personally been campaigning for. All while protecting and maintaining public spending for the next two years at the levels set out in 2021.</p>



<p>The plan involves a roughly equal split between tax rises and spending cuts, with the greatest burden falling on those who can afford it most. Specifically, the plan:</p>



<p><strong>Increases taxpayer funding for our NHS and schools by an extra £11 billion over the next two years.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; The Government will provide £4 billion in additional funding to schools and £7.7 billion in additional funding to the NHS and social care sector over the next two years. Prioritising the public services that matter most.</p>



<p>&#8211; £2–3 billion in additional funding for the NHS in each of the next two years so we can bring down ambulance waiting times, tackle the Covid backlog, and improve access to GPs. Also providing £2.8 billion next year and £4.7 billion the year after for adult social care, which aims to double the number of people leaving hospitals on time and into care by 2024, addressing unmet needs and boosting low pay in the sector.</p>



<p>&#8211; £4 billion in additional funding for schools over the next two years. We are increasing the schools budget by £2 billion this year and £2 billion next year to help schools with rising costs as a result of inflation. Which is more than Labour has pledged to give schools.</p>



<p><strong>Introduces no headline tax increases.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; The Autumn Statement raises £25 billion in additional taxes over the forecast period but there are no increases in the headline rates of tax. By targeting tax rises toward businesses, wealthier households, and the oil and gas industry, the Government has ensured that it can honour its manifesto commitment not to increase Income Tax, National Insurance, or VAT.</p>



<p>&#8211; Instead of raising rates, the Government is freezing personal tax thresholds for a further two years. There are also reforms to the Additional Rate threshold, so that a taxpayer who earns more than £150,000 will pay £1,200 more in tax per year.</p>



<p>&#8211; It is only fair that companies who have made genuine windfall profits as a result of the war in Ukraine make an additional contribution to pay for the support we have outlined. So from 2023, the Energy Profits Levy rate will rise from 25per cent to 35per cent and will continue until the end of March 2028. A 45per cent Levy will be applied to extraordinary returns made by electricity generators. In total these windfall taxes will raise £52 billion over six years. This is more ambitious than Labour’s proposal.</p>



<p><strong>Protecting and maintaining public spending.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; For the next two years public spending will remain at the levels set out in 2021 and then increase by one per cent in real terms each year until 2027–28.</p>



<p><strong>Supporting every household with their energy bills.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; The Energy Price Guarantee will continue to support everyone for another year. This winter, the price households pay for the energy they use will be capped, so that a typical household will pay £2,500. From April 2023, the price cap will rise so that a typical household will pay £3,000. The Energy Price Guarantee will then end in April 2024.</p>



<p><strong>Supporting the most vulnerable through maintaining the pensions triple lock and raising benefits in line with inflation.</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; I have been publicly campaigning for benefits and pensions to be increased in line with inflation for some time now, and so was very pleased to see the Chancellor yesterday confirm that this would be part of the Government’s plan.</p>



<p>&#8211; To protect the most vulnerable, benefits will now be increased in line with inflation for 2023–24. More than 10 million households in receipt of working-age and disability benefits will see an increase in their benefit payments.</p>



<p>&#8211; The pensions triple lock will also be protected. Because of the difficult but necessary decisions the Government has taken elsewhere, the triple lock for pensions will be protected in full. This means that in April, the State Pension will increase in line with inflation, which is the biggest cash increase in the State Pension ever.</p>



<p><strong>Additional support for the most vulnerable.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Over £12 billion of additional targeted support is assigned to help the most vulnerable households. The Government will continue providing this year’s cost of living payments and next year it will provide extra one-off payments of £900 for the 8 million households on means-tested benefits, £300 to pensioners, and £150 for disability benefit recipients. The Government is also providing £1 billion of extra funding by extending the Household Support Fund for another year.</p>



<p>The OBR has confirmed that these plans will restore the public finances to a sustainable position and help reduce inflation and unemployment. And I look forward to engaging with my ministerial colleagues as these policies are rolled out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Remembrance Sunday:</h1>



<p>This year for Remembrance Sunday on 13th November, I was honoured to lay wreaths in Ripley and Kilburn in memory of those who have served our county, and in honour of those who are still serving. There are a multitude of remembrance services held across our constituency every year, so it is unfortunately impossible for me to attend all of them. However, every year I try to rotate which services I attend. This year it was a memorial service at Ripley War Memorial in the morning and another in Kilburn in the afternoon.</p>



<p>This has been a particularly important period of remembrance as we mark 40 years since the end of the Falkland’s war, and we commemorate the 255 British personnel who lost their lives in defence of the islands. Their courage and sacrifice must never be forgotten. Thank you to everyone who organised or supported the remembrance services and parades across Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Alfreton Solar Farm Update:</h1>



<p>On 21st October, I spoke at the public inquiry into plans from Kronos Solar to build a 50-megawatt solar farm between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. Many of you will remember that Amber Valley Borough Council’s (AVBC) planning authorities rejected the proposal last December, stating that the project’s scale and impact on the landscape outweighed any environmental benefits the site would provide. However, Kronos Solar have since filed an appeal to overturn the decision of AVBC and get the site approved, resulting in this enquiry.</p>



<p>I have been opposing the project on behalf of local residents and businesses throughout the process, a great many of whom have contacted me about the proposals. I very much support the expansion of our clean energy network, and in the right place a solar farm would be an asset. However, there are good reasons why this site was refused planning permission. We all want renewable energy expansion but not at any cost.</p>



<p>To begin with, much of the land is north facing, which means the site would need to be overly large. The impact on the amenity of local residents, the impact on the countryside area, and the impact on the various heritage assets is just too great. And that is before we consider Alfreton Park and Alfreton Park Community School, which looks after children with the very highest level of need, very close in the vicinity.</p>



<p>It is clear to me that this is a totally unsuitable site for this intensity of development. Frankly, I believe this proposal was not based on a thorough search for suitable land for a solar farm, instead, it looks to me to be based on a search for a suitable sub-station, with the proposal then trying to force some land to suit.</p>



<p>I will continue to keep residents updated on any developments. And at present, a decision is expected at some point in the next few months.</p>



<h1>Pollution and our waterways:</h1>



<p>I have recently welcomed the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs’ (DEFRA) plans to raise the civil penalty for water companies who pollute our environment by one thousand times, from £250,000 up to £250 million. I am hopeful that increasing the penalties the Environment Agency can enforce without a lengthy and costly court process will enable swifter and stronger action to be taken against water companies that illegally pollute our environment.</p>



<p>Many residents have contacted me about pollution and the use of storm drains in our sewage system. There has also been a great deal of misinformation circulating on social media regarding the Government’s campaign to address these issues.</p>



<p>Last year, the Government introduced the Environment Act 2021 which was a bill designed to tackle this problem and reduce sewage pollution ignored by previous Governments. When the Environment Act was going through Parliament the Duke of Wellington, a hereditary peer, introduced an amendment that would legislate the complete elimination of storm drains and therefore of storm overflow sewage into our waterways. This of course sounds admirable, and indeed is something I support in principle. However, this amendment came without a plan for how it could be delivered and how such a vast project could be funded.</p>



<p>Initial assessments suggested elimination would cost between £150 &#8211; £650 billion. To put those figures in perspective, £150 billion was more than the entire schools, policing, and defence budgets put together. Therefore, the Government did not support the amendment, and I did not vote for it. In my view, the last thing people wanted was for their water bill to go through the roof.</p>



<p>Twitter mis-informers seized this opportunity and claimed we had all voted in favour of water companies dumping raw sewage into our rivers. Which was totally false, and ironically punished the Government for actually trying to do something about the problem ignored by previous Governments.</p>



<p>With this most recent announcement by DEFRA, I am glad to see the Government continuing the campaign to improve the quality of our waterways. To hold water companies to account, and ensure any polluter pays for the environmental harm they cause, the Environment Agency must take advantage of these new powers.</p>



<h1>Illegal crossings over the Channel:</h1>



<p>Many of you have contacted me about the number of small boats illegally crossing the English Channel in recent months. I appreciate the strength of feeling on this alarming issue and want to outline my position to you and explain some of the challenges we face in tackling this problem.</p>



<p>The number of illegal entries into the United Kingdom via small boats crossing the English Channel is too high. It endangers the lives of those making the journey, puts money into the pockets of ruthless and brutal people smuggling gangs, and puts undue pressure on our existing asylum system as well as our public services. I remain committed to an immigration policy that welcomes people to the UK through safe and legal routes, and an immigration policy that allows us to provide asylum to those in genuine need. However, it is clear many of those arriving in small boats are not here in genuine need of asylum, and as a result, the current situation cannot go on.</p>



<p>One reason for small boat crossings increasing in frequency is the success the Government has had in tackling other forms of illegal immigration. Such as increased checks and security for lorries and freight crossing the channel, effectively reducing the number of illegal entries into the UK through these means, and increasing the number of people turning to small boats as a way to enter the UK. The problem that now presents itself is how to police and secure hundreds of miles of coastline 24/7.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Parliament passed the Nationality and Borders Act which overhauled our approach to asylum and illegal migration. The legislation includes fairness towards those who need our help, and in welcoming people through safe and legal routes, but firmness in tackling abuse of the system and expediting the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection. It is worth noting that Labour opposed this Act designed to toughen our immigration system.</p>



<p>Further to changing the law in this country, the Government has recently signed a joint UK-France arrangement on tackling small boat crossings in the Channel which includes a 40% increase in the number of UK-funded officers patrolling French beaches. The new agreement lays the foundations for deeper UK-French co-operation to tackle illegal migration. The arrangement means, for the first time, specialist UK officers will be able to observe French officials at work in control rooms and on the ground patrolling the coastline.</p>



<p>It is clear, however, that big challenges still lie ahead, and that the number of small boats currently crossing the channel is unacceptable. The Prime Minister speaking recently on GB News said that tackling illegal immigration was a huge priority for his Government, and that while the recent joint UK -France arrangement was a big step in the right direction there was more that needs to be done. I share the Prime Minister’s view, and will continue engaging with my ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues to make the case for further measures to reduce cross channel migration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world&#8217;s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
