<p>Nia Griffith MP said:</p>



<p>“We encourage everyone who will be affected by this proposal
put forward by the Plaid Cymru&nbsp;Carmarthenshire County Council Cabinet to
make their voice heard during the consultation.</p>



<p>Pupils, parents and staff at the schools, as well as
everyone living nearby, have an important role to play in the future of
education provision in the area and their input will be vital when any decision
is made.</p>



<p>This is the sort of far-reaching decision which needs
proper community consultation, and a realistic appraisal of the needs in years
to come. There has been a very large number of new houses built relatively
recently on the Mynyddygarrreg side of the by-pass, and full account needs to
be taken of the impact of these new developments on future school numbers. Even
in a couple of years the situation could have changed significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every child deserves the best education and the best start
in life that can be provided.&nbsp; This proposal will impact on many future
generations as well and needs to be considered very carefully by everyone
involved. This consultation needs to be the start of a conversation about
what’s best for children in the area and I hope that the Council will listen to
what local people have to say about it.”</p>



<p>Lee Waters MS added:</p>



<p>“I know this is an issue which the school Governors have
wrestled with for some time and there is clearly a delicate balance to be
struck between maintaining a strong sense of community with a school at its
heart, and allowing children access to the best facilities and a teaching body
with enough capacity to give them the best education.</p>



<p>“It’s important the
Council don’t rush into making any decisions here. I’m particularly concerned
about the impact closing Mynyddygarreg will have on travel patterns. Just at
the moment when we’re trying to help people leave their cars at home more
often, the relocation of educational facilities could have the opposite effect.</p>



<p>The issue of small
rural schools and their future viability is a really difficult one. I think the
case of Mynyddygarreg is far from settled, so I hope the Council do their
upmost to listen to residents.”</p>



<p>The proposal under consideration is:</p>



<ul><li>Discontinue Mynyddygarreg primary at the end of
August 2021.</li><li>From September, all pupils to be registered at Gwenllian
primary, which would operate on both sites and increase its capacity.</li><li>Alter Gwenllian primary&#8217;s catchment area to
include that of the Mynyddygarreg area.</li><li>Relocate Gwenllian primary to a new site and
increase its capacity to 210 pupil and 30 nursery places, with the new school
ready in 2023.</li></ul>



<p>The consultation process on the proposal is due to commence
on 11<sup>th</sup> January 2021 for a period of six weeks.</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has congratulated local charity Syria Relief for their charitable efforts during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Syria Relief, based in Denton, is known for their charity and humanitarian work in Syria, but during the lockdown, they have raised over £10,000 and set up a foodbank from scratch in order to support families in Tameside.</p>
<p>Syria Relief were driven to do this during the early stages of lockdown after some of Tameside’s foodbanks were forced to close (often due to panic buying and demand outstripping supply) and helped fill food provision gaps.</p>
<p>They set up <a title="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/ui_lCXL8Eioy1wmTrFyGM?domain=covidemergencyresponse.com" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/ui_lCXL8Eioy1wmTrFyGM?domain=covidemergencyresponse.com">www.covidemergencyresponse.com</a> to fundraise for local individuals most impacted by the pandemic and have, at the time of writing, fundraised over £10,500. They have also been involved in supplying hot meals to homeless and vulnerable families and distributing healthcare packs.</p>
<p>The project was led for Syria Relief by Dr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, a medical doctor with years of experience working in the NHS.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Syria Relief is an absolutely fantastic local charity that does amazing &#8211; and often dangerous &#8211; work supporting those caught up in the Syrian Civil War.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst the charity is very well known for their work in Syria, I&#8217;d like to congratulate them on all that they have done locally here in Tameside to help people through the difficult period of the lockdown &#8211; running a foodbank, providing vulnerable people with essentials and hot meals, and distributing healthcare packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very lucky to have such a fantastic charity right here in Denton, and I&#8217;d particularly like to thank Dr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar for all her hard work co-ordinating this lockdown work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

  <em>"These are the entrepreneurs we need to build Britain back as we recover from the economic wreckage of the coronavirus.</em>

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness and parliamentary sponsor of a bid for funding to help restore the direct rail route from Beverley to York, has said that he remains ‘optimistic’ about the project’s future, despite the proposal being initially turned down by the Government.</p>
<p>Back in June, the MP submitted a bid to restore the 32-mile length of track from Beverley to York to the Department for Transport’s Restoring Your Railway Fund. Billed as an opportunity to reduce traffic along the A1079 – boosting job opportunities and tourism in the area – the project has been rejected at the second funding round.</p>
<p>In total, 111 bids have been submitted by 219 MPs, all of which have been evaluated by a panel chaired by the Rail Minister, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, which also included the Chair of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy, and Isabel Dedring – the former London Deputy Mayor for Transport.</p>
<p>Despite this setback, the Rail Minister has described the proposal as having ‘potential’, and there will be an opportunity to strengthen the bid before submitting a revised case to the next round of funding. There remains strong local backing for the scheme in the area with East Riding of Yorkshire, City of York, Hull City and North Yorkshire County Councils all expressing their support, as have York MPs Julian Sturdy and Rachael Maskell and Humber MPs Dame Diana Johnson and David Davis.</p>
<p>Graham said, “This is of course disappointing news, particularly after the hard work of the Minsters Rail Campaign and East Riding Council to work up and submit the bid back in the summer.</p>
<p>“But this is definitely not the end of the line. Support for the project is still there, and there’ll now be opportunities to strengthen our bid and submit an even better case in a future funding round with the help of feedback and workshops from the Government.</p>
<p>“I will continue to do all I can to support this bid as I want to see greater investment into infrastructure in our area.”</p>
<p>Success in the Government fund would mean the Department for Transport covering up to 75% of the costs of carrying out extensive transport and economic studies so that a comprehensive business case can be created. Future funding to develop projects would be subject to agreement of the business case.</p>
<p>The proposed Beverley-York line would branch off the existing Hull-Scarborough route which runs through Beverley, with stops at Market Weighton, Pocklington, Stamford Bridge and Haxby – which has just been successful in the Government’s New Stations Fund.</p>
<p>Graham added, “The most recent census indicated that about a quarter of East Riding residents commute to either Hull or York, so I really think this train service would provide a popular alternative to the congested roads and sparse bus services we have at the minute.”</p>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Worcester MP, Robin Walker has celebrated the positive news that the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for nationwide vaccination, as Worcestershire moves out of national restrictions into Tier 2.</p>
<p>The decision made by the UK Regulatory Authority (MHRA) was made with advice from the Commission on Human Medicines, the government&#8217;s independent expert scientific advisory body, after carrying out a rigorous, scientific, and detailed review of all the available data.</p>
<p>The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week and elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.</p>
<p>With regular reviews of the tiered system, Robin is hopeful that the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be a significant step in making restrictions a thing of the past, however recognising the need to ensure that we reduce the impact on people’s lives and on the economy in the meantime by taking a careful approach.</p>
<p>The rate of infection in Worcestershire has been falling in recent weeks and Robin has spoken to Ministerial colleagues to make the point that Worcestershire’s rates are below the England average, which will give the area the best chance to get into a lower tier sooner. The roll-out of mass vaccination will help to provide a pathway for Worcestershire to move into Tier 1.</p>
<p>As well as the positive news of the approval of the vaccine, Robin is pleased that the Government has taken on-board some of the lessons of earlier approaches which needed to be reviewed, such as the 10pm curfew and the closure of gyms &amp; pools and adjusted the tiers accordingly. He has consistently pressed for support to ensure that as many people as possible keep their jobs and livelihoods and Robin will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Speaking after the news of the vaccine approval, Robin said:</p>
<p>“I strongly welcome the news that the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for roll out starting next week. It is a phenomenal step forward and a moment the UK should be extremely proud of. It is a testament to the UK’s scientific expertise and commitment to produce this vaccine.”</p>
<p>“I voted for the tiered system yesterday because I think it is the best-balanced approach to support lives and livelihoods for the time being and to prepare for the roll out of vaccines and mass testing which will hopefully take us out of this situation entirely.”</p>
<p>“Hospital admissions tend to trail the peak of infections by about two weeks so whilst it is welcome news that the number of covid-19 infections has been falling locally for the last couple of weeks, it is sadly the case that the number of people in hospital with covid-19 has remained high over this period and is now higher at 82 than it was one or two weeks ago. This has been a key factor for me in accepting that a position in tier 2 is justified for Worcester at this stage.”</p>
<p>“The Opposition’s approach of abstaining on the vote in the Chamber rather than proposing any alternative shows a complete lack of conviction and whilst I respect many of the colleagues who have decided to vote against the measures for one reason or another, I note none of them have proposed a viable alternative. Governments do not have the luxury of sitting on the side lines and commenting, they must take decisions and recognise that those decisions have consequences. I can assure you that I have thought through the consequences of mine.”</p>
<p>“As the Prime Minister rightly said this morning, it is the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get our economy moving again.”</p>
<p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:</p>
<p>“The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for use. This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.”</p>
<p>“The Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations (JCVI) will shortly publish its final advice for the priority groups to receive the vaccine, including care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.”</p>
<p>“The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week. The NHS has decades of experience in delivering large-scale vaccination programmes and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.”</p>
<p>“To aid the success of the vaccination programme it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>MHRA Chief Executive Dr June Raine said:</p>
<p>“We have carried out a rigorous scientific assessment of all the available evidence of quality, safety and effectiveness. The public’s safety has always been at the forefront of our minds – safety is our watchword.”</p>
<p>“I’m really pleased to say that the UK is now one step closer to providing a safe and effective vaccine to help in the fight against COVID-19 – a virus that has affected each and every one of us in some way &#8211; and in helping to save lives.”</p>
<p>“We are globally recognised for requiring high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness for any vaccine. Our expert scientists and clinicians worked tirelessly, around the clock, carefully, scientifically, robustly and rigorously poring over hundreds of pages and tables of data, methodically reviewing the data.”</p>
<p>“Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases. They save millions of lives worldwide.”</p>

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday (01/12/20), Parliament was presented with a simple, for or against, choice to vote on the renewed ‘Tier’ restrictions which have subsequently come into place this morning and the additional financial support package on offer to businesses, workers and households across Gateshead and the North East.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I wanted to take some time to explain my position on this matter and why I voted against the imposition of this package yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>At the outset, I absolutely agree with experts here in Gateshead and Nationally that we must prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout our communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>I also agree that the best way to do this is through limiting social interaction especially among meetings of multiple households.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The package of restrictions are not perfect, they appear to be ever more complicated and the allocation of tiers to different regions appears to be unequal at first glance, with areas in the North and North East subjected to greater levels of restrictions compared to other parts of the UK with similar or higher rates of incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>To this end, I have formally requested the Government publish the criteria used and set out some clarity on how regions will move between tiers while we await the rollout of a number of vaccine programmes.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The restrictions in place since the spring, closing large numbers of businesses across Gateshead and limiting the trade of so many others, have had an incredibly damaging impact on the lives and livelihoods and overall wellbeing of so many people.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government has a duty and the means to provide proper financial support to these businesses and their employees, and to this end, I firmly believe they have failed. While the initial business rate grant scheme and the furlough scheme seemed generous, many millions of people have been left without any support whatsoever and continue to be ignored 9 months on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>In addition, businesses in Gateshead which have either had to remain closed or have been once again forced to close – hospitality, fitness suites and retail particularly – alongside many self employed workers; have been left with meagre amounts of support, if any, as many businesses enter what would traditionally be their busiest trading period.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government appear to have prioritised funnelling billions of pounds of tax payer money into, sometimes selective, elements of the private sector to provide inadequate PPE and an ineffective test, track and trace system. Instead, they should be prioritising financial support for businesses, employees and families affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Failure to do so has not only had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of so many people, but it has had a detrimental impact on adherence to the restrictions. The Government must understand that many people can not work from home and do not have ready access to utilities and food, and many can not afford to withstand repeated periods of self isolation without proper financial support – Statutory Sick Pay is simply totally inadequate.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Notwithstanding the urgent need to restrict the spread of Covid-19, I voted against the motion yesterday evening, as I firmly believe the Government can and must do more to provide adequate financial support for every person and business affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have raised the inadequate financial support with the Government since the spring and will continue to do so until they meet their responsibility in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Now that the North East is officially subject to tier 3 restrictions, I would urge all residents to follow the rules closely, as this is the only way we can reduce the spread of the virus enough to move down the tier system. With our infection rates declining, because of everyone’s efforts and with positive news of vaccinations in the very near future, it is imperative that we all do whatever we can to further drive down the spread of Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I hope this sets out my view clearly, however, if you have any further questions please do contact my office.</span></p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

<p><span><span><span>Britain is the first country in the world to have a clinically authorised vaccine, following testing by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The UK has secured 40 million doses, with the first 800,000 arriving within days. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, a panel of independent experts, will shortly advise on the way in which the vaccine will be prioritised, including for care homes, health staff, over 80s, and the rest of the general public. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The vaccine has an efficacy of 95%, and has been tested on over 43,500 people in six countries, with no safety concerns raised. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: “This is fantastic news, and is a credit to the UK that we are the first country to clinically authorise a vaccine against COVID19. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>On a day where more freedoms are returned to us, this offers even greater hope for the future, and the return to some sense of normality we all crave. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I pay tribute to all the scientists and volunteers who have helped to bring about this success, and to the Vaccine Task Force for identifying this as the most promising candidate and securing doses at scale. To go from discovering a new virus, to an approved vaccine rolling out safely across the UK, in less than a year, is a truly incredible feat.”</span></span></span></p>

<p>“Weston has a long and valued tradition of making visitors feel welcome and included, no matter whether they’re arriving from Birmingham or Bangladesh. Hospitality is central to who and what we are, and the multi-cultural friendship association is an important part of our warm Weston welcome. Whether it’s a friendly face, or advice on how to get on your feet and find your way in an unfamiliar new place, their work creates communities where people know and value their neighbours, rather than just living alongside them. If they didn’t exist already we’d want to create them, and you can’t say better than that!”</p>

<p>Yesterday in the debate I urged the government to take those measures which both help control the virus and allow economic recovery. </p>



<p>I pressed the government again on where are the results of the tests of other drugs that might help treat CV 19 patients. After the good break-through with the steroid it would be good to hear about other possibilities.</p>



<p>I urged them to work harder with the hospitality industry on air extraction and other measures which would enable safer working in inside spaces, as many hospitality businesses will only survive if they can earn more money soon.</p>



<p>I asked them to reconsider the issue of compensation and support for the self employed, where many small business owners who work in their own business do not qualify for the support. </p>



<p>I have regularly raised the issue of creating specialist isolation hospitals for CV 19 so there is more capacity in the District Generals for all other medical problems. This of course means continuing the extra recruitment of staff the government has promised, and requires suitable Training and protective clothing for the volunteers staffing the CV 19 facilities. </p>



<p>I raised the issue that many of my constituents feel  strongly about. Why are West Berkshire and Wokingham in Tier 2 when numbers are quite low and we were in Tier 1 before the lockdown.  I voted against the Regulations.</p>

<h1>Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah: “the PM is misleading us about how much he really knows about Covid-19 transmission.”</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the news that Newcastle will be placed in Tier 3 restrictions, Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah has written to the PM accusing him of misleading her in how much he knows about COVID-19 transmission in Newcastle</p>
<p>Chi Said: <em>In October I asked the prime minister, in an oral question, if he knew where transmission was occurring in Newcastle, he said he did, so I then addressed three written questions to ministers </em><em>to find out what they knew. The final question was eventually answered on Friday, over six weeks after I asked, and the responses to all three show that no, they do not know where transmission is occurring in Newcastle. Is it in bars or shops? Is it in the student community or front line workers?</em></p>
<p><em>“It is important that we do everything we can to crush the rate of transmission of COVID-19. But the Government need to come clean with us about what they really know.</em></p>
<p><em>“The data the government is using to impose Tier 3 restrictions on Newcastle is from the 23<sup>rd</sup> of November, when data leading up to the 27<sup>th</sup> shows a marked decrease in Newcastle’s infection rate</em>.  <em>Why does it take them so long to process and collect the data?</em></p>
<p><em>“In summary the, the government don’t know where COVID-19 is transmitted, are using old data, and are misleading the country on how much they know.</em></p>
<p><em>“Today, I am asking the Prime Minister: </em></p>
<p><em>“Why did he pretend he knew where transmission was occurring in Newcastle?</em></p>
<p><em>“Why won’t they judge us on up to date data?</em></p>
<p><em>“Why don&#8217;t they give resources and data to local authorities who know local communities?</em></p>

              <h3>Drew Hendry (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Highland MP, Drew Hendry has praised the Inverness, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey Citizens Advice Bureau and Nairn Citizens Advice Bureau for their local Fair Delivery Charges campaign; which seeks to raise awareness of the detriment caused to local people by delivery surcharging and the lack of transparency around the use of surcharges. The campaign led by Citizens Advice Scotland also seeks to promote the Scottish Government’s ‘Fairer Deliveries for All’ map tool, which allows consumers to explore delivery prices charged by different companies and create a more transparent system.</p>
<p>With online shopping rates growing by 129% in the U.K. during the pandemic, there is a real shift in how consumers are purchasing goods. However, consumers living in affected Highland areas still pay an average of 30-50% more for receiving items bought online than in the rest of the mainland UK. Further analysis carried out by the Scottish Government in 2019 found that consumers in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch &amp; Strathspey paid over £7,000,000 in delivery surcharges, relative to the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>Mr Hendry has long campaigned against rip-off delivery charges and previously took a fairer delivery charges bill to the UK Parliament as part of his campaign to end excess delivery charges to rural areas. He also helped the Highland Council launch the national reporting tool it spearheaded as part of the ongoing work to end rip of delivery charges <a href="http://www.deliverylaw.uk/">http://www.deliverylaw.uk/</a>.  The SNP MP praises the CAB for their renewed efforts to support ongoing work to highlight the unfairness of excess delivery charges.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mr Hendry said:</p>
<p>“Every one of us living in the Highlands is familiar with the problem of unfair delivery charges; whether it’s surcharges being added to deliveries, or simply no delivery option available, despite offering delivery to mainland UK.</p>
<p>“Whilst I would always urge folk to support local where they can, we all know this is not always possible and consumers should not have to pay the price for companies shortcomings.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to see our local Citizens Advice teams prioritising this campaign and I would urge everyone in the Highlands to get behind it too, to raise awareness of ongoing unfair delivery surcharging faced by folk in the North of Scotland.”</p>
<p>“For my part, I will continue to press the UK government for legislation to end unfair delivery charges and take on companies charging constituents outrageous delivery charges. We can all play our part by reporting instances of excessive delivery charges at deliverylaw.uk, and folk can also make use of the Scottish Government’s Fairer Deliveries For All tool at <a href="https://fairdeliveries.scot/explore-your-postcode">https://fairdeliveries.scot/explore-your-postcode.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Today I asked the UK Secretary of State for Health a series of questions about the UK Government&#8217;s response to the Covid crisis; specifically, the suitability of the new tier approach to restrictions in England and how much support is being made available for Covid contacts to isolate.</p>



<p>A recent King&#8217;s College study found the vast majority of Covid contacts are failing to isolate. Failing to improve the existing &#8216;test, trace, isolate&#8217; strategy risks limiting progress in suppressing new Covid cases.</p>



<p>He also completely ignored my question about the logic of allowing 1000 people at indoor events in high risk areas in England from next week. With only 15 allowed to attend weddings, it is hard to grasp the logic of this.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Dr Philippa Whitford</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Many scientists have expressed concern that the easing of restrictions at Christmas could lead to another surge of&nbsp;<em>covid</em>&nbsp;cases in January. With cases still over 80% of the level at the start of lockdown, is the Secretary of State not worried that allowing outdoor events of 2,000 participants and indoor events of 1,000 in level 2 high-risk areas could drive up infection rates ahead of Christmas? Although lateral flow testing is very welcome, given how it increases capacity, the Secretary of State previously stated that the mass testing in Liverpool was a pilot and would be evaluated before being rolled out elsewhere. As the city has also been under tight restrictions and then lockdown, how will the impact of mass testing alone be evaluated? How does he plan to counter the lower uptake among deprived communities—the very ones at highest risk, as seen in Liverpool—and with no clinical evaluation yet published, how can he justify putting out contract tenders for an eye-watering £43 billion and rolling out this approach to 67 other areas? Should this strategy not be compared with investing money and energy in getting the traditional test, trace and isolate system working properly? Currently, over 40% of contacts in England are still not even informed that they should be isolating.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Finally, the Secretary of State knows that it is not testing, but isolation, that stops the spread of the virus. If people who are infected or could be carriers are not isolating, no amount of testing will stop viral spread. A study by King’s College London that suggested that fewer than a quarter were isolating when advised was incredibly worrying, so what assessment are the Government doing to clarify current isolation rates and understand the reasons why people may not follow the advice they are given?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Matt Hancock</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Of course, we are constantly evaluating the impact of people isolating, and how many people isolate when asked to. I would encourage the hon. Lady to look at a broader range of studies than just that one from King’s College, especially those dealing with the self-isolation of those who test positive, for whom the rate tends to be higher.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The hon. Lady asked about the use of these lateral flow tests to have a negative impact on the number of cases in an area. Of course, we have been evaluating this all the way through the study in Liverpool, which is why we can have confidence in rolling out more broadly across tier 3 areas. I included in my statement a high-level assessment of this. The number of cases in Liverpool city region is down by two thirds, but in the city itself, where the testing took place—the testing was of people who live in the city and of people who work in the city and live largely in the wider city region—the number of cases is down by over three quarters. That is one piece of evidence. It is clear that it is the combination of people following the rules and community testing, with appropriate incentives to get people to take up that mass community testing, that can help to make this work. We want to work with local directors of public health to understand how this can work effectively in their areas, precisely to reach those hard-to-reach people whom the hon. Lady mentioned.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Finally, I echo the hon. Lady’s request that we be cautious this Christmas. However, I am delighted that we have agreed an approach across the whole UK, including with the SNP Administration in Edinburgh, with the Welsh Labour Administration and the cross-party Administration in Northern Ireland, because there are so many ties that bind us together and mean that we are stronger as one United Kingdom, working together to tackle this virus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

<p>Isles MP Angus MacNeil is backing calls by Prospect Union to protect island jobs by opposing the centralisation of Air Traffic Control functions to Inverness.</p>



<p>Prospect members in Air Traffic Control at Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) are to be balloted on industrial action over HIAL’s plans to push on with its remote towers project.</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “This is an inevitable consequence of HIAL’s high handed approach to people’s jobs and livelihoods and damaging the island economy by taking critical, well paid jobs out of the area.  It is time now for the Scottish Government to step in.</p>



<p>“HIAL’s answers have not been good enough. Air Traffic Control staff and the public deserve better. The Transport Minister needs to get involved and our Air Traffic Control services need to be kept in Benbecula and Stornoway.”</p>



<p>Prospect have stressed that any industrial action will have no effect on emergency services and if action is taken it will be after the Christmas holiday period.</p>

<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>



<p>I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.</p>



<p>It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. </p>



<p>However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.</p>



<p>Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121<sup>st</sup>
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.</p>



<p>Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.</p>



<p>Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.</p>



<p>It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.</p>



<p>We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.</p>



<p>We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.</p>



<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely<br>Cllr David Mellen<br>Leader, Nottingham City Council</p>

<p>Last week’s announcement of an additional £16.5 billion boost for defence represents the biggest spending boost for our Armed Forces for more than 30-years.</p>
<p>This will result in 10,000 new jobs a year, it will help revitalise UK shipbuilding, help the UK to become a world leader in cyber and space as well as allowing us to invest more resources in research and development.</p>
<p>Our Armed Forces do a tremendous job from keeping us safe to assisting with humanitarian operations. Their sense of duty and their professionalism is an example to us all and this additional support for defence spending is very welcomed news.</p>

			<p>As we approach the halfway point of the Government’s nationwide lockdown, I want to thank constituents and businesses for abiding by the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The Government has lost control of the virus, and my first duty is to keep my constituents safe. That is why I voted for the lockdown. Nobody voted for the regulations with anything but a heavy heart. I did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>This period must be used to undertake the transfer of test and trace to local public health departments, including a full resource transfer. In addition, the Government must ensure that the NHS and social care are fully prepared with adequate PPE, as high as possible uptake of flu vaccinations and regular testing regimes.</p>
<p>I have proposed measures to protect the clinically vulnerable and providing ‘supportive shielding’ so that people don’t experience the devastating isolation that happened last time. We must also make sure we have simple, coherent messaging with local community engagement as well as monitoring and enforcement capacity to support people complying during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Local restrictions have had a devastating effect on people living in care homes and their families.  As co-Chair of the APPG on Dementia I have received heart-breaking stories from Oldhamers, unable to visit their loved ones for months on end, and who have seen a marked deterioration in their condition, particularly for those living with dementia.</p>
<p>I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the impact of coronavirus on people living with dementia, their families and carers last week, where I challenged the Minister on these issues. I pressed the Minister to report back to Parliament on her trial of visitor testing which starts on 16<sup>th</sup> November in 30 care homes, with the intention of rolling out testing for visitors across the country in December.  It is essential that family members are able to safely visit their loved ones in care homes, especially as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>I have also been challenging the Government on how they’ve been awarding Covid-related contracts. Billions of pounds of public money has been awarded to private companies often with no experience in delivering medical supplies. The Government’s repeated refusal to come clean about where this public money has left no option but to compel the Government to come clean through the courts. This is why I partnered with Caroline Lucas MP, Layla Moran MP and the Good Law Project in legal action to force the Government to publish details of private covid and PPE related contracts.</p>
<p>Whilst we recognise that at the beginning of the pandemic we needed to move quickly, this does not justify the Government’s wholesale disregard for transparency including the publication of contracts awarded. The Government has now disclosed that at least £17 billion worth of Covid-19 contracts have been awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care since April, with over £4 billion of these contracts being hidden. The transparency gap is therefore growing.</p>
<p>I am pleased that last week the High Court granted our judicial review to challenge the Government’s persistent failure to publish these contracts. The hearing is scheduled for mid-January 2021 and I’ll keep you informed of our progress.</p>
<p>Do look after yourselves and stay safe.</p>

<p><a><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Earlier this month I was delighted to be personally invited by renowned businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist, John Mills to join the advisory board of his new Institute for Prosperity recently. The nine person advisory board is made up of a group of cross-party MPs, former MPs and Peers. All of whom have Ministerial or Shadow Ministerial experience.</span></a></p>



<p>The Institute was set up earlier this year by Mr Mills who is also the founder and Chairman of South Shields based consumer goods company JML, which sells high-volume consumer products in the UK and 85 countries worldwide.&nbsp;The Institute’s aim is to increase prosperity, growth and equality by putting a more successful economic future at the heart of British political discourse.</p>



<p><em>South Shields, like many towns across the country have been decimated by lack of investment and deindustrialisation and many have been forgotten by successive governments. Growing up I watched this powerful and prosperous industrious town slowly wither and as a result 100’s of skilled jobs, like that of my fathers disappeared too along with much needed investment. So, I am delighted to work alongside John and parliamentary colleagues to do all we can to find a consensus, to provide a platform to bring people with fresh ideas together and to find new solutions to Britain’s economic problems.</em></p>

<p>Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. </p>



<p>Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: </p>



<p>“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.</p>



<p>“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.</p>



<p>“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.</p>



<p>“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” </p>



<p>Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25<sup>th</sup> November. </p>

<p><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP and Ex-RAF Serviceman Steve McNamara Remark on Remembrance Sunday 2020</strong></p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional remembrance memorial services have halted by the coronavirus pandemic, preventing gatherings around memorials and cenotaphs.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>However, Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps believes that this should not lessen our commitment to remembering those who have died in war.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Visiting the Hatfield Memorial Garden, Mr Shapps said: “Today cuts very deep inside really because it makes you recall…the ultimate sacrifice that so many have given to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have today.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s so easy to forget what they went through- the horror of it all- so that we could live in peace.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Steve McNamara, an RAF veteran from Welwyn Garden City with grandfathers who fought in both First and Second World Wars, said:</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“I think every generation has historic, cataclysmic events that define them.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“For this generation, it is probably COVID. It has produced heroes and victims, and I think these will be remembered in the future.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps also spoke of the vital role of the Armed Forces in the battle against the virus:</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“This is a Remembrance Sunday like no other, as we battle this coronavirus.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“But the thing to remember is that a lot of the people that we’re here commemorating and thanking, are actually out there serving right now.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Thousands internationally, but also at home in the battle against the virus- for example in Liverpool, helping with mass-testing.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps laid a wreath at the Hatfield memorial. He said: “I think in the Armed Forces we have as much to thank today as we ever have.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s why Remembrance Sunday- even remembering it slightly differently than usual is so important.”</p>
<p>A video of the visit was produced, which you can view below:</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>This month sees the end of the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, which was put in place at the start of lockdown to avoid mass job losses. It leaves many people in Bristol South facing a very uncertain future.</p>
<p>I, and my Labour colleagues, have been pushing to see the scheme extended for those hardest hit sectors which are still unable to operate properly due to ongoing restrictions. Disappointingly, the Government chose to ignore the calls from us, from business owners, trade unions, think tanks, the cross-party Treasury Select Committee and some of its own MPs; in doing so, it has let down hundreds of thousands of people working in vulnerable industries such as hospitality, leisure, travel and the arts.</p>
<p>Bristol South does not have lots of large employers which can accommodate mass remote working set up. Families across Bristol South rely on paid work with Bristol Airport and in cafes, bars and restaurants as well as the creative sector. It’s home to lots of small businesses, many of which were struggling before the pandemic hit and this has made things a hundred times harder. I’ve heard from local business owners and self-employed people with heartbreaking stories of their family business, in the community for decades employing local people, suddenly facing financial ruin and closure as a result of this pandemic.</p>
<p>The percentage of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Bristol South has already risen from 3.6% in March to 6.2% this summer, and this is likely to increase further. I’m hearing from lots of people who’ve always worked and have never had to apply for government support before. And it’s hitting women and young people particularly hard. We must act now to avert the biggest jobs crisis of a generation.</p>
<p>The Government announced the launch of a Kickstart scheme to support younger jobseekers in August, but we’re yet to see this in action and there appears to be no job guarantee at the end of it. I welcome the offer of extra paid incentives for businesses taking on new apprentices and would encourage employers in Bristol South to explore this further, but they too will need jobs at the end of their training and, at the moment, there is no guarantee there either.</p>
<p>This piecemeal approach is not enough. We need a national plan for job retention and creation as well as retraining. I will continue lobbying the Government on this and am working on plans for my 2021 jobs and apprenticeships fair to help link local people up with jobs and training opportunities. In the meantime, there is help available locally to support people with job hunting and employability skills, see <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/16/support-for-employers-and-jobseekers/"><strong>here</strong></a> for more details.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/10/28/opinion-karin-smyth-mp-on-a-rise-in-unemployment-in-bristol-south/" target="_blank">OPINION: Karin Smyth MP on a rise in unemployment in Bristol South</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p>

              <h3>Alec Shelbrooke (Elmet and Rothwell)</h3>

<p>Network Rail is preparing the final stages of delivering step-free access at Garforth Railway Station, it has been announced. </p>
<p>Alec had been campaigning for new step-free access at Garforth for over a decade before finally securing funds direct from the Department for Transport. Alec will continue to work closely, cross-party, with Garforth&#8217;s Independent Councillors to represent the views of residents through the planning process. </p>
<p>Announcing the scheme in 2014, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “After years of false starts and broken promises under Labour, it is a testament to the local Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke’s persistent campaigning that I can announce that this scheme is finally happening for the people of Garforth”.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Alec has been in regular contact with Transport officials pushing for firmer plans and no further delays. He also raised the matter several times in the House of Commons Chamber. </p>
<p>But today it has been announced that the final stage before construction is now underway.</p>
<p>Alec said: &#8220;Today I&#8217;m delighted that Network Rail has formalised a plan with four options for stakeholders to choose from before the submission of a full planning application to Leeds City Council. It is my hope that Leeds City Council can deal with the application swiftly to avoid no further delays&#8221;.</p>
<p>“I have been campaigning for step-free access at Garforth Station for many years. We had an original plan submitted but this then incurred unnecessary delays along the way but I have been committed to providing disabled people and pushchair users with the same access to travel as everyone else &#8211; and delivering step-free access at Garforth station will help thousands more people travel easily and without additional cost, time or stress&#8221;.</p>
<p>Previously, Garforth resident Mrs Morris said: “We’ve waited far too long for disabled access at Garforth. The elderly, disabled and those with pushchairs have not been able to use the station so we’re extremely grateful to Alec for fighting alongside us to deliver this disabled access”. </p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s Access for All programme was first launched in 2006 and has delivered more than 200 accessible routes into selected stations so far.</p>
<p>A further 1,500 stations have received smaller scale improvements such as accessible toilets, platform humps to reduce stepping distances and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment.</p>
