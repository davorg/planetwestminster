<p>I, like so many others, have been appalled by events in recent weeks in Ukraine. It has however, been inspiring to see how, yet again, our City has pulled together to show support to those most in need. </p>



<p>It has today been reported that two million people have so far been displaced by war in the country, with fears this could considerably rise. </p>



<p>BirminghamWorld has put together a article with a number of ways you can help out: <a href="https://www.birminghamworld.uk/news/where-in-birmingham-can-i-donate-clothes-to-ukraine-how-to-help-refugees-with-donations-and-volunteering-3591888" rel="nofollow">https://www.birminghamworld.uk/news/where-in-birmingham-can-i-donate-clothes-to-ukraine-how-to-help-refugees-with-donations-and-volunteering-3591888</a> which includes; </p>



<ul><li>Donating clothes to <strong>Bearded Broz</strong> in <strong>Smethwick </strong>&amp;</li><li>A drop off point for goods at <strong>The Hive</strong> in <strong>Moseley </strong></li></ul>



<p>For those who can, you can donate to the The Disaster Emergency Committee, a coalition of 15 leading UK aid charities, Ukraine appeal here: <a href="https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal" rel="nofollow">https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal</a> </p>



<p>I will continue to press the Government to do more. I recently wrote in the Birmingham Mail that we must stop trading with all Russian banks, close our airspace, block all investment and freeze their assets. I have also asked the Home Secretary what progress has been made on the implementation of the humanitarian community sponsorship route for Ukrainians with no ties to the UK.</p>



<p>I shall also keep residents updated with the best ways they can get involved to help out. </p>

<p>Readers of last week’s edition of the <em>Barnsley Chronicle </em>will have seen the story of Darfield Councillor Pauline Markham, the victim of a despicable and cowardly attack in a local park, simply for serving the public to the best of her ability. In her own words she summed up the injustice, “I was simply a woman who was walking her dog.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly, Pauline’s story is part of a much wider issue – our collective failure to take violence against women and girls seriously. We’ve seen it locally in the rising instances of girls’ drinks being spiked on nights out, soaring cases of stalking in the last year; and the devastating statistic that 86% of women aged 18-24 in the UK have been sexually harassed.</p>

<p><strong>Rt Hon Sir John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con)</strong>: The Home Secretary has a lot of support on the Government Benches for the compassionate and sensible way in which she is going about this. Will she confirm that she is listening both to what the refugees want, which is often not a long-term settlement a long way from Ukraine, and with regard to the security issues that this all poses?</p>
<p><strong>Priti Patel, The Secretary of State for the Home Department</strong>: My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. I must emphasise that every single crisis requires a bespoke and unique response. There are two very big calls coming from the region and from our counterparts. First and foremost, they are asking for help on security measures right now; that consistent theme is coming over. That comes down to checks—they are undertaking checks—but they are also very concerned about wider security issues, some of which I simply cannot discuss in this House, for clear reasons. The second point—even the Ukrainian ambassador made this point to me yesterday and I hear it every single day from my counterparts—is that there is a call to keep people in region. There is a big demand for that, and that is where the wider aid effort has to focus, in addition to the work that we are doing on humanitarianism.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend—by the way, I support enormously what he has been saying about the banking frauds—is making a very important point in relation to whistleblowers in a domestic context. In this context, we are talking about sanctions against people who potentially undermine the law of this country, as we saw in Salisbury, by taking action into their own hands against whistleblowers—trying to take them out. It is entirely appropriate to defend the personal safety of people who undertake whistleblowing.</p>

<p>I am writing to you with information about local help for those affected by the situation in Ukraine as well as how you can contribute to the national fund being collected to support people affected by the War.</p>
<p>A local team has set up a collection centre for local donations in the old H&amp;M unit in the Ashley Centre. That’s the original unit near House of Fraser and not the double floored one which has closed recently. They are in the process of setting up a formal charity to do so, and have an organised plan to move donations out to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their biggest ask right now is for donations of medical supplies, and in particular things like bandages, as well as over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen. If you have items that you do not need, or are willing to buy some and drop them off there, I know that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>They are also asking for donations to help pay for fuel costs to get van loads of supplies to the Polish/Ukrainian border, and are able to take cash or card donations at the centre in Epsom.</p>
<p>If you want to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee/Red Cross national appeal the link to the appeal site is here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dec.org.uk">www.dec.org.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>Your donation is being match funded by the Government.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me about providing accommodation locally for Ukrainian refugees. I am in discussions about this at the moment and will provide a further update later in the week.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

<p>The Ukrainian people are showing great courage and strength in the face of an appalling Russian onslaught and we need to support them &#8211; including through giving sanctuary to those fleeing war in Europe as we have done in generations past.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Ukraine Family Scheme is now live, to support Ukrainians in joining family in the UK. You can find more information <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people in Leicester are asking how they can best support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. Estimates suggest there are already over 2.9 million people in need, and this is only going to increase. City of Sanctuary have put together a list of suggestions on how to support the people of Ukraine. Read it <a href="https://cityofsanctuary.org/2022/03/02/how-you-can-support-the-people-of-ukraine/">here</a>. Leicester&#8217;s Ukrainian club are also doing a huge amount to arrange for donations to be sent to those in need. You can find out more about how you can get involved <a href="https://www.facebook.com/leicesterukrainianclub">here</a> and <a href="https://linktr.ee/KalynaHome?fbclid=IwAR2fGqE4m41ZJ98k4rTYA_smpYFpj--8cDHBP_lguO1i7TsiF8Mj5Uh5dtY">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government is also matching public donations to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukraine-what-you-can-do-to-help">this</a> appeal pound-for-pound up to £25 million.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>The past fortnight has seen hundreds of emails, letters and calls to my office from constituents about the need for the UK to do more following the shocking, barbaric and disgraceful attacks by the Kremlin forces on an innocent democratic European neighbour.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>That’s why, with events moving fast, I took the time to read through them all and consider a number of very important points that I want to address in turn now:</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><strong>1) Sanctions </strong><br /><br />
Firstly, it is clear that the only language that Putin and the Kremlin respect is power and money. NATO has been clear that our priority must be to give as much indirect support as we can to Ukraine without breaching NATO’s treaty undertakings.  <br /><br />
Individual nations are free to decide and supply weapons and assistance unilaterally and I’m proud that the UK has been an early, leading and vital defence supplier to Ukraine with large amounts of anti-tank and anti-aircraft technology, as well as technical support, provided to the Ukrainian defence. UK support for Ukraine so far has included measures such as:<br /><br />
--- The UK has trained over 22,000 members of the Ukrainian army through Operation ORBITAL and, since 2019, assisted Ukraine to build up and sustain a naval capability.<br /><br />
--- In the months prior to the invasion, the UK provided extra support in the form of 2000 anti-armour missiles.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br /><span><span><span>--- The UK has sent further military support (lethal aid in the form of defensive weapons, and non-lethal aid such as body armour and helmets) to Ukraine since the invasion.<br /><br />
--- The Defence Secretary recently hosted 25 countries as part of an international conference of donors for lethal and non-lethal military aid to Ukraine, coordinating donations and organising aircraft and support for donations to be delivered.<br /><br />
--- More than 1,000 British troops have been made ready to support NATO and allies in the event of a humanitarian crisis. These troops are at readiness in the UK to support a humanitarian response in the region should it be needed. <br /><br />
--- On his visit to Poland on 1 March, the Prime Minister announced that the UK is committing another £80m in aid to Ukraine to save lives, protect vulnerable people inside the country and in the wider region and to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis.<br /><br />
--- After the £100m economic package for Ukraine and £40m in humanitarian aid announced in February, this brings the UK’s overall aid support for Ukraine during the current crisis to £220 million.<br /><br />
--- The UK is also guaranteeing up to $500 million of loans to Ukraine through Multilateral Development Banks.<br /><br />
--- The Government is also matching the first £20 million donated by the British public to the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. (For more information, please see: </span><a href="https://donation.dec.org.uk/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal">https://donation.dec.org.uk/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal</a><span>.)</span></span></span><br /><br />
 </p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>2) Deeper UK and NATO Military involvement</span></strong><br /><br /><span>To prevent escalation of further military horrors, however, NATO, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet have decided not to take the huge step of providing air cover via the RAF or troops on the ground which the advice from the armed forces has been would risk massive escalation and the risk of a Russian declaration of hostilities directly against UK citizens and assets. The UK continues to provide active support for Ukrainian defence forces which we can and should all be proud of. </span></span></span><br />
 </p>

<p><br /><span><span><span><strong>3) Visas</strong></span><strong> </strong><br /><br /><span>Many are understandably asking why we aren’t processing visas and doing more, faster. Please be assured that I have raised this with Ministers in the Home Office as a matter of the greatest urgency and I am currently liaising with them on this. Along with other colleagues in Parliament, I will be doing all I can to find a resolution as quickly as possible.<br /><br />
So far, the Government has already announced changes which will allow an estimated one hundred thousand close family members of British nationals or other people settled in the UK to come here immediately alongside two further routes to the UK potentially for tens of thousands more. The Ukrainian Family Scheme, which will significantly expand the ability of British Nationals and people settled in the UK to bring family members to the UK, extends eligibility to adult parents, grandparents, children over 18, siblings, and all of their immediate family members. Under this scheme, which will be free, those joining family in the UK will be granted leave for an initial period of at least 12 months. They will be able to work and access public funds. <br /><br />
Eligible Family members who have already made applications under the existing family rules will be considered under the Ukrainian Family Scheme if they do not meet the family rules. They will also have their application fee and any applicable Immigration Health Surcharge Payments refunded. The Government is also opening a Ukrainian Sponsorship Humanitarian Visa Offer which will provide a route to the UK for Ukrainians who do not have family ties with the UK but who we will match with individuals, businesses, community organisations, or Local Authorities willing and able to act as a sponsor.</span></span></span><br />
 </p>

<p><br /><span><span><span><strong>4) Humanitarian aid for refugees </strong><br /><br />
The scale of the horror of Russian violence is driving a massive refugee and humanitarian crisis out of Western Ukraine, principally to Poland in the EU who have opened their borders. <br /><br />
It’s been truly striking and heart-warming to see the scale of humanitarian support from UK citizens - including many here in Mid Norfolk - wanting to reach out to Ukrainians. Only this week I was liaising with Paul and the team at the Railway Tavern in Dereham as they looked to get their articulated lorries of aid to Poland. </span></span></span></p>

<p><br /><br /><span><span><span><strong>5) Russians in London / UK </strong><br /><br />
The issue of sanctions on Russians living in London, donations to all political parties and other causes and business interests is serious. <br /><br />
Whilst none of us want to trigger unjustified attacks on innocent Russians here as emigres from the Putin regime, or as legitimate students or artists or scientists escaping from Putin’s Russia, I do think we need to start getting much tougher on known allies of Putin like the owner of Chelsea FC Roman Abramovich, and the others who have huge houses in central London and enjoy all the trappings of London and its financial services to help launder and conceal their often criminal wealth.  <br /><br />
We need to be careful not to criminalise legitimate dissidents who have fled Putin to come to London and become UK citizens and work and invest and pay taxes here. But we should stamp down hard on the Putin Kleptocrats who have treated London as a playground. <br /><br />
That's why, in lockstep with allies around the world, the UK is:<br /><br />
--- Sanctioning Russia's Central Bank, banning the Russian State and all Russian companies from raising funds in the UK, and freezing the assets of all Russian banks. <br /><br />
--- Shutting off Russian banks' access to the global financial system by blocking access to SWIFT.<br /><br />
--- Sanctioning President Putin, his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, leading oligarchs and hundreds of individuals, entities and their subsidiaries at the heart of his wicked regime. <br /><br />
--- Strengthening export controls against Russia by banning the export of high-end and critical technical equipment and components in sectors including electronics, telecommunications, and aerospace, thereby degrading Russia's military and economic development. <br /><br />
--- Sanctioning members of the Russian Duma and National Security Council for their support for the invasion.<br /><br />
--- Banning Aeroflot, Russia's national airline, and all other Russian commercial and private jets from UK airspace.<br /><br />
--- Denying access to UK ports to ships owned, controlled, charter of operated by anyone connected to Russia as well as any vessel registered in Russia or flying the Russian flag.<br /><br />
--- Imposing new restrictions to cut off wealthy Russians’ access to UK banks.<br /><br />
--- Imposing sanctions on Belarus for its complicity in Putin's invasion.<br /><br />
--- Extending a Crimea-type embargo to occupied territory in the breakaway Ukrainian republics.<br /><br />
--- Intensifying sanctions enforcement, with new powers for law enforcement and a specialised Kleptocracy unit to crack down on companies that breach sanctions.<br /><br />
--- Bringing forward measures from the Economic Crime Bill early which strengthen Unexplained Wealth Orders and broaden their scope, cracking down on corrupt elites in the UK.<br /><br />
With news breaking by the hour, I am monitoring the situation very closely and ensuring that all your concerns are raised at the very highest levels of government.<br /><br />
Thank you once again for taking the time to contact me on what is a profoundly tragic issue for the UK, Europe and the world.</span></span></span></p>

<p>On Monday I attended the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-02-28/debates/2c650227-ac66-4819-aeb2-4b2bf74e56d2/DraftGoodsVehicles(LicensingOfOperators)(Amendment)Regulations2022">Second Delegated Legislation Committee</a> to discuss the Statutory Instrument (SI) “The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022, which was laid by the Department of Transport of the UK Government to amend legislation governing the goods vehicle Operator licensing regime. The UK is obliged to implement these changes following commitments included in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) which come into effect this year.</p>
<p>The purpose of this SI is to extend the goods vehicle operator licensing regimes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to include light goods vehicles (LGVs) such as vans and pick-up trucks which weigh more than 2.5 tonnes up to 3.5 tonnes in maximum laden weight alone or combined with a trailer, and which operate internationally for hire or reward.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport Trudy Harrison MP stated that the original SI did not correctly achieve policy aims, because it should only apply to goods vehicles, but one part inadvertently applied to passenger vehicles, and so disrupts the Public Passenger Act 1981.</p>
<p>The Minister had already sent a letter to all members of the committee on Monday morning which stated that she was extremely disappointed that this issue had occurred and the causes are being addressed as a matter of urgency within her department. She also hoped that any issues could be covered in the committee debate.</p>
<p>There was quite a heated exchange between our Labour Shadow Spokesperson Gill Furness and the Minister about the need for this urgent amending SI, without actually stating that the DfT had messed up by not including this in the original SI. We did not oppose the amendment which is necessary to re-align the regulations.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, the main business in the Chamber was consideration of Lords Amendments to the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-02-28/debates/6254EF37-9538-4A42-94DD-7EACBC5EA9E4/PoliceCrimeSentencingAndCourtsBill">Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill</a>, and we had a series of votes which started at 8pm, in which we supported all the Lords Amendments. The last 4 votes were taken at midnight, finishing at 1am, which meant that MPs were trying to get home, or to their London lodgings, an hour after the London tube strike had started. As you are aware the security of MPs has been of concern again following the murders and threats to MPs, but the UK Government did not take this into consideration, and pushed the amendments to a Division so that they could vote against all the Lords Amendments.</p>
<p>Tuesday was dominated by Dydd Gwyl Dewi Sant, St David’s Day.The celebrations started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1498727269493211139?cxt=HHwWhoCsldqgxswpAAAA">choir of primary children</a> from Ysgol Gymraeg Llundain, beautifully dressed in traditional Welsh costumes, who met Welsh MPs and the Speaker in Westminster Hall to serenade us with Welsh songs. The children were absolutely amazing and their teachers were so proud of them. After listening to the beautiful voices of the children, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1498693056400433157?cxt=HHwWioC94Z7ZtswpAAAA">the Speaker raised the Welsh Flag</a> in Parliament Square. It rained throughout the flag ceremony, but we are used to rain in Wales.  Then we attended an Eisteddfod hosted by the Speaker in his official rooms, where we <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1498708393644593158?cxt=HHwWjMCokf7VvcwpAAAA">listened to choristers</a> and speeches.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday I celebrated the forthcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1499360942915686402?cxt=HHwWhMCsia215s4pAAAA">25 years of World Book Day</a> due to take place on 3rd March by attending a drop-in event held in Westminster. The theme was “changing lives through a love of books and shared reading”. The OECD has found that reading for pleasure is the single biggest indicator of a child’s future success, more than family circumstances, parent’s educational background, or income. The National Literary Trust survey indicated that 3 in 5 children said that reading during lockdown made them feel better. Last year 55% of primary school children said that they read more books as a result of World Book Day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I chaired the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-02/debates/c04082cc-a91d-4650-8972-1e4b9bc54790/DraftSocialSecurity(Scotland)Act2018(DisabilityAssistanceAndInformation-Sharing)(ConsequentialProvisionAndModifications)Order2022">Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which discussed The Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (Disability Assistance and Information-Sharing) (Consequential Provision and Modifications) Order 2022, which makes consequential amendments to legislation to provide for the treatment of various social security payments made under the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018. The SI will create a new disability benefit Adult Disability Payment (ADP) which will replace PIP, extend a 50% discount or exemption for road tax, those in receipt of ADP can acquire a driving licence at 16, and can apply to vote by proxy and sign by proxy a petition for the recall of an MP, without the need for attestation of an application. The SI also provides information-sharing between Scottish Ministers and the Secretary of State for Transport (DVLA), in order to implement these provisions. The SI was not opposed.</p>
<p>Wednesday at midday, I attended PMQs, and all MPs gave a very emotional standing ovation to the Ukrainian Ambassador who was in the Public Gallery. There is a Parliamentary rule against applauding in the Chamber, but we clapped for many minutes to show that we support the bravery and resolve of the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister, and its people.</p>
<p>After PMQs I attended a virtual briefing hosted by the New Democracy Project and Labour Friends of Ukraine. We heard from two Russian experts, Lincoln Pigman, a Russian-American fellow at the Foreign Policy Centre, and Dr Jade McGlynn of Oxford University, both of whom have been closely following the developing situation in Ukraine. The event was chaired by Sir Tony Lloyd MP with a speech from Labour Shadow Europe Minister Stephen Doughty MP.</p>
<p>Following on from a joint meeting between the APPG for Sport of which I Chair and the APPG for Mountaineering, chaired by Derek Twigg MP, when we discussed the effects of Brexit on the sport and recreation sectors, I arranged for the UK Government Minister for Sport, Tourism, Heritage, Civil Society and Youth Nigel Huddleston to meet virtually with Tom Cloke, chair of Alpine Sports, which represents: GB Snowsport, Snowsport Scotland, Snow Sport Wales, DSUK, Ski Club of GB, British Association of Ski Instructors, British Association of International Mountain Leaders, British Association of Mountain Guides, Snowsport Industries of GB, Max Nicholls, Policy Officer for the Sport and Recreation Alliance, and myself. Tom explained the loss of revenue of his sector who used to operate in the EU, but cannot now do so, because work permits, local laws and protectionism, and cross-border service provision have raised barriers. Also, there has been a loss of reputation and influence because UK Snowsport bodies are now perceived as being outside the circle of influence in the EU, and relationships which have been developed over many years have been lost. Coaches and athletes cannot perform because they can’t train in the EU states. Insufficient time in the snow with a coach will result in loss of medal results. Tom asked the Minister to consider changing the system to allow: applying for short term work permits; increasing mobility for named seasonal professionals from 90 in 180 days to 180 in 360 days; and UK-EU Youth Mobility Schemes. Max Nicholls stated that there were similar problems with other sports who wish to continue training and participating in the EU, and provided alpine mountain biking and road cycling as examples. The Minister said that he was aware of the situation because he has been approached by many sports in a similar situation, but he would liaise with other Government Departments to assess the current situation, and report back. I thanked the Minister for granting us the meeting and for listening to our concerns.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Back Bench Business Committee granted a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-03-03/debates/170D494A-BA3E-4909-84C1-B7DA6753F0FA/WelshAffairs#contribution-C191B026-CBFF-4889-92F2-3B7795F63F93">St David’s Day Debate</a> on Welsh Affairs led by Wayne David MP for Caerphilly. Wayne and I went to the same comprehensive school, Cynnfig, and I thanked him for supporting me throughout my time in Parliament. I spoke about my dear friend Hywel Francis, who sadly and tragically passed away on 14th February 2021, and the influence that he had on the history of Neath, South Wales, and beyond. Sometimes words are not enough to express the legacy that Hywel created and I miss him more everyday. I also <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1499730788513951748?cxt=HHwWiMC5wZnNjtApAAAA">took the opportunity</a> to intervene on the Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart to ask him when the UK Government would be releasing the funding for the Global Centre of Rail Excellence which is to be built in Onllwyn, so that we can get on with it. Mr Hart promised to find out the date, so I followed up immediately with a written question.</p>
<p>Back in my Neath constituency, I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/NPT_YS/status/1498677554517000201?cxt=HHwWkoCy3fTSr8wpAAAA">Youthfest celebration of youth services</a> in the Upper Amman Valley, which took place at Cwmgors Rugby Club and Gawain-Cae-Gurwen GCG Community Centre. The Mayor of Neath Port Talbot Council, Cllr John Warman, opened the event, the Welsh Government Minister for Education, Jeremy Miles MS, presented awards to newly qualified youth workers, and I gave a vote of thanks to everyone who had worked so hard to make the day an overwhelming success. There was a full day of superb events including Warriors Martial Arts, Music Workshop with GCG Brass Band, and the famous Organised Kaos Youth Circus. I was delighted to meet members of the Neath Port Talbot Youth Council, Cllr Sonia Reynolds and candidate councillor Sarah Thomas, (both of whom will be standing in the May Local Government elections). I am very grateful to my friend Cllr Arwyn Woolcock, who will be retiring as Cllr for Lower Brynamman at the May elections after 33 years’ service to the residents of the Amman Valley. We will miss his hard work and dedication.</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is backing Labour&#8217;s plan to deliver professional careers guidance in schools. This pledge coincides with National Careers Week, and is part of the Party&#8217;s plan to ensure young people leave education ready for work and ready for life.</p>
<p>Labour has committed to ensuring every young person gets professional information, advice and guidance on their future study and career options alongside two weeks worth of work experience while at secondary schools, helping students to make informed choices about their future.</p>
<p>The government cut back careers advice in 2011, despite headteachers warning it could leave two million young people with the support they need. Pre-pandemic data showed that this had left two thirds of young people without professional careers advice and almost half reporting that they felt unprepared for the future.</p>
<p>Last month, the Conservatives’ voted against giving young people careers advice as part of the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill, blocking plans to ensure young people have the skills and support they need to succeed.</p>
<p>Alongside recruiting over a thousand new careers advisors for schools, Labour’s plan to ensure every young person leaves education ready for work and for life would embed digital and life skills across the curriculum and ensure all young people have access to laptops and technology ensuring they have the skills they need to succeed and prosper.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This National Careers week, it&#8217;s more important than ever that we give young people the tools they need to leave education work and life-ready. Children across Denton and Reddish, and across the country, should be aware of all of the opportunities that are open to them.</p>
<p>Yet Tory MPs voted against Labour&#8217;s plans to reintroduce this essential support for young people, after their disastrous decision to abolish the former careers service.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud to be supporting Labour&#8217;s plan to ensure that every child receives professional careers guidance, alongside two weeks worth of work experience while at school, as part of our plans to ensure young people leave education ready for work and ready for life&#8221;.</p>

<p>I was pleased to join the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly at the start of the week for one of our biannual plenary meetings. After the restrictions of Covid, it was good to meet with so many colleagues in person. Together we condemn Putin’s invasion of and war on Ukraine. A close working relationship is vitally important between Britain and Ireland and the UK and Ireland. We continue to stand together against violence and tyranny, and we continue to emphasise the importance of dialogue and debate over the common problems and challenges that we face. Whatever the headlines say about the Northern Ireland protocol, we in both parliaments will continue to discuss, debate, and ultimately work together to ensure peace and prosperity on both our islands.</p>
<p>I was pleased to speak during questions on Health and Social care this week. The Government seem to think that there is some kind of magic staffing tree, but there is no increase in capacity, no elective recovery and no fixing of social care without an immediate and ambitious workforce plan. We have legislation in this place, and we have seen a tsunami of White Papers, but none of that includes a credible workforce plan. Given the estimated 93,000 NHS vacancies and more than 110,000 vacancies in social care, I asked the Health Secretary in Parliament this week when we could expect such a plan. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/stressed-nhs-staff-quit-at-record-rate-of-400-a-week-fuelling-fears-over-care-quality">The Guardian have recently reported</a> that around 400 workers are leaving the NHS every week in order to restore their work-life balance, with many complaining of burnout and PTSD following two years of battling with the Covid pandemic. This is completely unsustainable and we need a credible workforce plan that incorporates both hiring and retention of staff with acceptable and supportive conditions and pay.</p>
<p>On the topic of capacity and sustainability of the care system, I submitted a question to the Health and Social Care department on what recent assessments have been made of the impact on earning capacity and wellbeing of being an unpaid carer. Given the extremely challenging living crisis situation that we are facing in this country and the challenges facing the social care system, I find it unbelievable that the only assessment available is from BEIS from March 2020. The Health and Social Care Department should urgently address this issue and ensure that health plans for recovery include consideration of the role of unpaid carers and the ways in which they can be supported, financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>This week, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee questioned Michael Gove on the work of his Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities. I was interested to hear from Michael Gove on the Strategy and Policy Statement for the Electoral Commission. We are concerned that the Government’s Statement could put at risk the full independence of the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission themselves have written to the Government to voice their concerns that such a Statement from the Government would be inconsistent with the role of an independent body and with maintaining public trust in the system. This is completely unacceptable and we must defend the role of the Electoral Commission to be entirely separate from Government.</p>
<p>I was pleased to join a Cancer Drop In event in Parliament on the backlog that the NHS are facing with delivering diagnoses and providing treatment. The Covid pandemic hit at the worst time for the NHS: a decade of austerity had already depleted much of their resources to enable them to withstand the immense pressures and challenges that the pandemic brought. A decade of underfunding and understaffing has led to long waiting lists and a lack of investment in ageing equipment. We need an increase in treatment capacity that comes from more funding for staffing and more funding to replace equipment with the high-tech, cost-effective treatment of radiotherapy that is used in half of cancer treatment.</p>
<p>I know many constituents are concerned about the rise in eating disorders, indeed, in Bristol South we have seen a large increase in cases, so I visited a drop in event sponsored by Dr Agnes Ayton and Professor Gerome Breen to learn more. Dr Ayton has been leading vital research at the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust looking at the treatment of anorexia nervosa. One of the challenges is that people who are admitted to hospital when their condition becomes life-threatening and often involuntarily, are discharged when still malnourished. Readmission rates are as high as 50-60%. Her study suggests that providing uninterrupted care that includes integrated cognitive behaviour treatment improves outcomes and readmission rates. It’s clear that health isn’t something that is addressed in hospitals and GPs with our physical bodies; we have to take a greater holistic approach and recognise the importance of mental wellbeing in our treatments and health as a consideration across policy-making.</p>
<p>This week I supported Luke Pollard’s Ten Minute Rule Bill Keyham’s Law. On 12 August 2021 five people were murdered and two further people were injured in a shooting in Keyham and Ford in Plymouth. Keyham’s Law has three proposals: One, it would ban keeping pump-action weapons in homes (a pump-action weapon is fast to load and easy to use). Gun certificate holders who can demonstrate a legitimate reason for keeping these weapons in their homes who work in farming or pest control would be the only two permitted exemptions. Two, it would call for mental health concerns to be addressed by linking medical records to gun certificates. Under these proposals a person’s gun certificate would be linked to their medical records and if there were any concerns flagged about their mental health, the competent body for issuing the gun certificate would be required to review the person’s suitability for holding a gun certificate and possessing a gun. And three, it would make violent misogyny an aggravating offence. We have to do all we can to prevent such awful tragedies happening again.</p>

<p></p>



<p>BREXIT needs to push the UK into pursuing a path into further deregulation to help British businesses become more competitive internationally, Tory MP John Penrose insisted.</p>



<p>The Conservative MP insisted Boris Johnson needs to intervene to ensure one of the key benefits of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.express.co.uk/latest/brexit" target="_blank">Brexit</a> is delivered. He said the UK must resume its reform scheme to remove outdated regulation to ensure British businesses become more nimble and more competitive. He denounced the current Government&#8217;s strategy as threatening to leave business owners getting lost in a &#8220;blob&#8221; of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.express.co.uk/latest/european-union" target="_blank">European Union</a>-inspired bureaucracy.</p>



<p>Mr Penrose told the Prime Minister: &#8220;In addition to the tragedy in Ukraine, I know the Prime Minister also wants to slash red tape to make Britain more internationally competitive.</p>



<p>&#8220;David Cameron succeeded but after he left, we abandoned his programmed one in, two-out regime and added billions in red tape costs instead.</p>



<p>&#8220;Last month&#8217;s Benefits of Brexit document repeats the mistake, vetoing one in, two out for another toothless regime.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I urge the Prime Minister to step in before it&#8217;s too late?&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;Otherwise the blob will win and we will fail to deliver a key benefit of Brexit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Johnson insisted colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was appointed as Minister of Brexit Opportunities last month, was already working on removing old EU-influenced regulations to help free businesses from added bureaucratic burdens.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister said: &#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to say that we have a new Secretary of State for post-Brexit freedoms and that he&#8217;s driving a campaign to reform, repeal and replace outdated legislation and regulation across the board.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the blob, I can think of no more fearsome antagonist for the blob than my right honorable friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>The one in, two out approach was first adopted under David Cameron and meant ministers seeking to introduce a new regulation that would leave businesses facing added implementation costs need to remove or modify previous rules with double the cost to business.</p>



<p>Brexit has remained a hot topic in British politics despite the British Government striking a deal on future trading relations with the European Union in December 2020.</p>



<p>The Protocol relating to Northern Ireland is still a key point of contention between the bloc and the UK, with the DUP lamenting the impact the agreement has had on the nation&#8217;s role within the union.</p>



<p>Northern Ireland&#8217;s powersharing Executive collapsed earlier this month when the DUP&#8217;s Paul Givan resigned as first minister in protest at the protocol.</p>



<p>His party leader told the Bipa meeting: &#8220;Those who claim that the Northern Ireland Protocol is designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the political institutions that were created by it surely must now recognise that the three sets of relationships covered by the agreement have been damaged since the protocol was implemented.</p>



<p>&#8220;The continued imposition of the protocol upon Northern Ireland has cast its long shadow over our political arrangements at Stormont, as well as on a north-south and east-west basis and the everyday lives of our people.</p>



<p>&#8220;The genuine objections to it cannot be wished away, nor simply ignored.&#8221;</p>

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil has written to Transport Scotland and Caledonian MacBrayne calling for the introduction of ‘booking-windows’ for the summer ferries to and from the islands.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil is suggesting a staggered release of vehicle bookings which will improve access to ferries for all, including islands residents who have to travel at short notice.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “We have just come out of a winter period where many islanders have felt locked due to ferry breakdowns and inclement weather.</p>



<p>“As a result, we want to make sure that we plan now to avoid another difficult summer. We have seen disruption due to bad weather; we don’t want further difficulties due to the sheer volume of people.</p>



<p>“I am suggesting this year that, regardless of where people come from, there be a staggered release of space on car decks. 70% in the beginning, then 20% the month before and the last 10% in the week before the sailing. This gives different types of travellers, regardless of where people live, the ability to make these bookings. It gives businesses and people who need to travel at short notice or attend hospital, the hope of being able to travel.</p>



<p>“I would also suggest to Councillors and Community Councils to write to Calmac and the Transport Minister to ensure their voices are heard and that the strength of feeling is understood.</p>



<p>“We cannot have a situation where the winter weather is blocking island travel and the success of summer island tourism is also blocking island travel. Given the rising demand over the last couple of years, the only way to achieve this is to introduce ‘booking-windows’.”</p>

<p><img class="content-edited" alt="Tim with Gill Haigh" title="Tim with Gill Haigh" src="/en/image/6q5pTB/360/270/tim-with-gill-haigh.png" style="width: 360px; height: 270px; float: right;"/>Tim Farron MP and Cumbria Tourism have joined forces against the proposed rise in VAT. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, lowered the rate to 12.5% to combat the effects of the pandemic but plans to return the rate to 20% in early April. Cumbria Tourism have discovered in a recent survey of their circa 2500 member businesses that the proposed VAT rise was the fourth biggest concern for members.</p>
<p>As the tourism and hospitality industries are one of the biggest employers within Cumbria the proposed rise is of particular concern following the COVID-19 pandemic and in the wake of the rising costs of living. In 2020 overseas residents flying to the UK fell by 96% and overall, the pandemic is estimated to have cost the UK tourism industry £2 Billion.</p>
<p>Tim Farron and Cumbria Tourism are calling on the Chancellor to not go ahead with the planned rise in VAT.</p>
<p>Tim has said, <em>"The tourism and hospitality industries are fundamental to Cumbrian life. The pandemic has been devastating on these industries and whilst the lowered VAT rate has helped boost the economy a little it is nowhere near recovered enough for the rates to return to 20%.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"We also need to keep people in employment and these local businesses will not be able to do that if they have to keep raising prices to keep up with VAT and other rising costs of living. Keeping VAT low is fundamental to keeping our local high streets thriving."</em>
</p>
<p>Gill Haigh, managing director of Cumbria Tourism, has added<em>, "The impact of COVID-19 had a catastrophic impact for the county's tourism industry in 2020, wiping £2billion off the value of our visitor economy. Whilst Government support has been hugely welcomed, significant challenges remain - not least around recruitment, which is now potentially holding back future growth. Combined with rising costs and supply issues, many tourism and hospitality businesses continue to struggle and we continue to urge Government to extend the discounted VAT rate.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"At the same time, there is also huge opportunity. Looking ahead, there is the chance to capitalise on the new 'staycation' experience, convert the 'new' visitors we have attracted over the past 18 months into repeat custom and increase short breaks out of season.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Now is the time to seize the moment, invest and really take tourism seriously as an economic driver for the UK and extending the discounted VAT rate would be one way the Government can help make that happen."</em>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong><strong><strong>Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps has won refunds for residents of Ashley Court, Hatfield, who were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire, and then subject to unfair service charges for housing they were unable to reside in.</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p>It has been over a year since the residents of Ashley Court were forced to leave their homes due to an electrical fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time residents, many of whom are vulnerable and require care, have been off-site &#8211; residing in temporary accommodation.</p>



<p>Building work aimed at restoring Ashley Court has also been delayed.</p>



<p>Previously, residents of Ashley Court were billed £225 per month in service charges for housing they had not occupied.</p>



<p>This monthly fee included charges for various services, including a Scheme Manager and Caretaker costs, which residents were not benefitting from.</p>



<p>In December 2021, local MP Grant Shapps wrote to Sanctuary Housing, the housing association responsible for managing Ashley Court, expressing his concern about “the impact on his constituents” nominally resident there.</p>



<p>Sanctuary Housing responded to Mr Shapps’ letter but at that time did not agree to waive the £225 a month charge.</p>



<p>In February, Mr Shapps wrote to the association once again (below), this time saying that he was putting it “on notice” over its unfair treatment of residents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40879" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letter-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="729" height="1024" src="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40880" srcset="https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-729x1024.png 729w, https://www.shapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280220letterp2-480x674.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>Following this most recent letter, Sanctuary Housing responded quickly.</p>



<p>In a major victory for the residents, the association apologised, saying that it had got its “approach wrong” regarding Ashley Court, and that it would be refunding service charge payments to residents as appropriate.</p>



<p>The association also said it would refund payments for deceased residents to their respective estates.</p>



<p>Sanctuary Housing stated it would be conducting a “more detailed review” of how the residents of Ashley Court were put in their previous unfair situation and would share its findings with Mr Shapps’ office.</p>



<p>The association agreed to meet with Mr Shapps in March saying that its representative would apologise in person, and that it would put itself on the “appropriate footing” to work with him going forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Councillor Peter Hebden, County Councillor and Borough Councillor for Hatfield East, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of the residents of Ashley court, will also attend the meeting.</p>



<p>Cllr Hebden said of the recent good news: “This is a fantastic step forward for the residents. There are other issues to be resolved but if Sanctuary Housing are adopting a new resident-focussed stance then I’m a lot more optimistic”.</p>



<p>Mr Shapps gave his own thoughts on the matter adding: “This is a great result for the residents of Ashley Court, and I’m incredibly happy to have been part of the effort to facilitate it.</p>



<p>“As Councillor Hebden has said, this is a step forward for the residents, and I’m sure that our meeting with Sanctuary Housing will yield further results.</p>



<p>“Putting residents in such an unfair situation was unacceptable, so I’m hoping that this outcome will go some way to putting their minds at ease.” &nbsp;</p>

			<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Over the last few days, I have received many emails from constituents, and indeed from across the country, expressing concerns and even outrage at the invasion of Ukraine, an independent sovereign state, by President Putin’s military machine. I distinguish the act of this dictator and tyrant, Putin, from the Russian people, who like most people everywhere, want to live their lives in freedom and peace. I want to express my solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also I want to commend those brave Russians who are standing up to Putin’s warmongering. His erratic and irrational behaviour is a serious threat to us all.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Putin’s attack on Ukraine is an unprovoked and unjustifiable outrage that will have tragic consequences for Ukraine, Europe and our world. It is a heinous violation of international law that breaks multiple treaties and commitments, including the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. Putin’s actions should be utterly condemned by all nations. As such, I regret that some countries in the UN Security Council failed to support a UN resolution calling for this yesterday.</em></p>
<p><em>This assault on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must now have serious consequences for Putin and his supporters. I am clear that there can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we depend and have broadly enjoyed since the end of the Second World War.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>We must now match our rhetoric with action. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin and against the Russian Government’s interests, working in a coordinated and unified way with our allies to ensure the Putin regime faces the severest possible consequences for their actions.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The UK sanctions earlier this week have been recognised as far too limited. Yesterday’s additional sanctions are wider reaching but there will undoubtedly need to be more. Some of you have proposed your own sanctions including ‘isolating </em><em>Russia completely’ and ‘stop buying oil, gas and other commodities from Russia’. I agree. Under Putin’s presidency, Russia must be seen as a pariah state and ostracised from the world economy.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>We need to move quickly to stop the influence of corrupt Russian money in the UK. Despite warning after warning, the Government failed to act, leaving Britain as the destination of choice for kleptocrats who hide their wealth under our noses. It has been going on for far too long and should not have taken an invasion of Ukraine for the Government to act. The Economic Crime Bill must now be brought forward, as well as introducing an Overseas Entities Bill.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>But we must prepare for the consequences of these sanctions against Russia in energy and financial markets, working with our allies and partners to manage disruptions and shocks.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>International co-ordination with our allies is imperative. This applies not just to sanctions, but to humanitarian aid and military defensive actions. We must work in conjunction with our NATO allies to mount our response against Putin.</em></p>
<p><em>In the short term, we must:</em></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><em>ensure the Foreign Office is providing effective consular support and assistance, with sufficient staffing and resources, to help UK nationals and their families seeking to leave.  I have been pressing Ministers in the Foreign Office and Home Office for nearly a month now to make access to visas and travel documents for UK nationals and their families easier.  I am pleased there is an effort to streamline the process, but believe Ministers could, and should, have acted</em><em> far</em><em> more quickly.</em></li>
<li><em>provide urgent humanitarian assistance and to work with our partners and Ukraine’s neighbours to manage </em><em>the </em><em>large-scale displacement </em><em>that we are already seeing as </em><em>refugee</em><em>s</em><em> fl</em><em>ee their homeland</em><em>.</em></li>
<li><em>continue to play our part as a member of NATO to support and reinforce other NATO members on the Eastern flank.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>As difficult as it is to predict irrational behaviour, we must try and anticipate Putin’s next steps. In relation to this, given the overwhelming evidence that Russian state actors have tried to disrupt and destabilise western democracies by disseminating disinformation through social media platforms such as Facebook, including at election times, I asked the Prime Minister what steps his Government was taking to prevent this happening now. Unfortunately this doesn’t seem to be on the Government’s horizon yet. It should be.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t believe the Russian people want this war; this is an ageing and unstable leader with a warped view of what his legacy should be. The international community’s response must learn the lessons from history.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I’m grateful to everyone who has contacted me so far and for the humanity and kindness they have shown for the distress of the Ukrainian people. I’d particularly like to thank those of you who have offered to open up their homes to Ukrainian refugees. This is the Oldham and Saddleworth I’m so proud to serve.</em></p>

As British United Nations Commander in Central Bosnia I found a massacre site at a place called Ahmici on 22nd April 1993.  Over one hundred Bosnian Muslim civilians – mainly women and children -  had been murdered there.  Immediately I considered it to be genocide.  It was formally classified as…

<p>I was in #Gaza at start of peace process in 1991, but have seen #Palestinian hope for #peace and security turn to dust over 30 years with no progress.<br>Illogical for U.K. Gov to claim to support #TwoStateSolution without recognising BOTH states!</p>

<p>I want to start by declaring an interest in that I was a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians in Gaza in 1991 and 1992.</p>



<p>And after visiting in 2016, helped them set up a breast cancer project between Scottish specialists and the local teams in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>



<p>And I want to thank all the clinicians who take part in that on a regular basis.</p>



<p>In addition to almost 55 years of occupation, the people of Gaza have suffered from 15 years of intense blockade and repeated military attacks every few years, which has degraded their civil infrastructure.</p>



<p>The tap water, unlike in my time is now undrinkable; raw sewage pollutes, coastal fishing waters, and due to the destruction of the power plant in 2014, there&#8217;s only intermittent electricity, including to hospitals.</p>



<p>This undermines the public health of Palestinians, but also the provision of health care; with the destruction of clinics and hospitals through military attacks and demolitions and difficulty in obtaining medical supplies with approximately a third of vital drugs running constantly close to zero stock. Many modern therapies are simply not available in Gaza.</p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s very difficult for patients to get permission, to travel to East Jerusalem, to access treatment. Gaza has no radiotherapy provision, which is important for preserving the breast in breast cancer patients. When I visited in 2016, all the women I met had undergone radical mastectomy because they couldn&#8217;t access the treatment. But it&#8217;s even more vital in other cancers, such as lung cancer, where it&#8217;s the main treatment.</p>



<p>And overall the World Health Organization report that 35 to 40% of patients who apply for permission to travel to Jerusalem are refused, delayed, or get no response. And all of this contributes to the poor survival of Palestinian cancer patients. On annual training visits prior to the pandemic, I&#8217;ve also seen the impact of the occupation and fragmentation and in the West Bank,</p>



<p>with communities separated from each other, their farmland, and particularly their water sources. Palestinians face constant harassment and obstruction. Their homes are demolished while settlements are relentlessly expanded in what is defacto annexation and conquest by concrete.</p>



<p>The UK has a particular responsibility as the 1917 Balfour declaration promised a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, but that nothing shall be done, which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities.</p>



<p>For over 70 years, the UK has recognized the State of Israel and honour that promise to the Jewish people, but broken it to the Palestinians.</p>



<p>So after 55 years of occupation, 15 years of Gaza blockade and the ongoing annexation of the west bank, the two-state solution is simply becoming unviable, unless there is a reversal of current Israeli policy.</p>



<p>And there is no chance of that without external pressure.</p>



<p>Government ministers repeatedly stand in this chamber and claim the UK supports a two state solution, but this is hollow if there isn&#8217;t recognition of both of those states.</p>



<p>And that is a minimum, it must be combined with real action, to ensure no UK banks or companies profit from occupation or illegal settlements. I was working in Gaza at the start of the Madrid peace process. And by late afternoon saw young Palestinian men giving olive branches to Palestinian soldiers. That image of hope has crumbled to dust 30 years on. Immediate recognition is the minimum and is vital.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Wednesday 23 February, Preet Kaur Gill MP will lead calls for reform to the exempt accommodation sector in the House of Commons.  </p>
<p>Labour’s Opposition Day debate will focus on exempt accommodation which in the last five years has overwhelmed Birmingham’s housing stock, increasing by 62% and now provides over 21,000 units with support to some of the most vulnerable people.  </p>
<p>As Preet Kaur Gill MP will explain, current regulation is extremely limited which is allowing “too many bad landlords getting into this sector for the wrong reasons, exploiting a toxic cocktail of relaxed regulation, a Conservative housing crisis and an epidemic of unmet need after years of council cuts.” </p>
<p>In her speech, Preet will share how working with local residents, Birmingham City Council and West Midlands Police she was able to successfully close Saif Lodge, an exempt property in the constituency which was causing huge problems for neighbours – the first order of its kind in the country.  </p>
<p>Preet will say to Government that this care cannot be provided on the cheap and that we must seek reform. It should be noted that there is no statutory definition of what care, support or supervision is in the context of exempt accommodation. Therefore, there needs to be five main asks for reform: </p>
<ol start="1"><li>
	A statutory definition of the care, support and supervision. 
	</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li>
	Resources for local authorities to fund inspection programmes for exempt in their region. 
	</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li>
	Ensure individuals and families housed in exempt have a link to the area they are placed. 
	</li>
</ol><ol start="4"><li>
	Give local authorities and the social housing regulator greater enforcement powers and strengthen the vetting process. 
	</li>
</ol><ol start="5"><li>
	Birmingham has called for government to align existing planning and HMO licensing policies to capture supported housing provision that is currently exempt from licensing and give local authorities powers to reject applications in a specific area on the grounds of oversupply. 
	</li>
</ol><p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “Millions of pounds of taxpayer’s money is being shovelled to the operators of these exempt properties without apparent due diligence or scrutiny.  </p>
<p>“The Government has had reports from Prospect Supported Housing, Spring Housing, policy recommendations from Crisis, Birmingham City Council, as well as reports from multiple community groups. All of these reports are pointing in the same direction. Yet, the Government has failed to act. </p>
<p>“Lives are literally at stake. Survivors of domestic violence; prison leavers; care leavers; people with mental health and substance abuse issues deserve a housing system that supports their transition to happier, more independent lives and our communities in Birmingham deserve neighbourhoods that are peaceful and safe, not a magnet for crime.” </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br />
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

<p>Speaking in a debate on Access to NHS Dentistry which Judith co-sponsored, Judith told the government they were trying to solve long-term issues with short-term fixes:</p>



<p>“The current dental contract and under-investment makes work for dentists highly stressful and doesn’t allow them to provide the quality of care to their patients they feel they deserve. There are long-standing problems with burnout, recruiting and retention, with almost a thousand dentists leaving the NHS in England in the last financial year.”</p>



<p>According to the British Dental Association, over 40 million NHS dental appointments have been lost since the start of the pandemic, which amounts to a whole year’s worth of NHS dentistry in pre-COVID times.</p>



<p>Judith continued: “While the government has provided limited amounts of money for dentists to catch up on missed appointments, dental practices in my constituency tell me the funding is virtually unusable. It must be used by March and there is simply physically not enough time to fit these appointments in.”</p>



<p>However, this was an issue brewing long before the pandemic, as even before COVID, there was only enough dentistry for around half of the adult population in England to see an NHS dentist every two years.</p>



<p>Speaking after the debate, Judith said: “There is not a week that goes by where I don’t have someone contacting me about the lack of dentists. We’ve lost a whole year of appointments while the government is giving with one hand and taking away with the other because the government just knows the money just cannot be spent.</p>



<p>Yorkshire and the Humber has the worst child oral health in the country, with twice the level of tooth decay than in the East of England. In Bradford, almost a thousand children under the age of 10 had to be admitted to hospital to have decayed teeth removed under a general anaesthetic last year. That is thousands of children who are in pain while they await surgery.</p>



<p>We need a new deal that treats dentistry as an equal member of the NHS family and not as a Cinderella service. We must work to achieve a fully funded service where NHS dentistry is available to all. The government needs to act and it needs to act now.”</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p>Last week saw two publications from the UK Government, both of them were unedifying and deeply unsatisfactory in their own ways.</p>
<p>The Sue Gray update, which was supposed to be a complete, unredacted report of the rule-breaking parties at number 10 Downing Street, rightly got a lot of attention in the press.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from many of you, sharing your anger at the lack of respect and humility shown by the Prime Minister and his Government. I am sure it won&#8217;t surprise you that I share your frustration at the situation, and I wish I could do more than respond with words of agreement. Rest assured, in Parliament, I will continue to make your views on the subject heard.</p>
<p>The Sue Gray update was a heavily censored summary but made it clear that there had been &#8216;Serious failures of leadership&#8221; at Number ten. The Prime Minister cannot escape this verdict; he is the leader at No. 10. No amount of cover-up and no matter how high the mountain of lies, the fact is that he is unfit to hold office. He said he was &#8220;furious&#8221; with staff when the story first broke and, remember, gratefully accepted the resignation of his Press Secretary, Allegra Stratton, before Christmas. Yet, he thinks he can carry on regardless.</p>
<p>The second report published last week was the &#8216;Benefits of Brexit&#8217; report. It was published alongside the Sue Gray report &#8211; obviously, a failed attempt to divert the news cycle. Frustratingly, it only got minimal coverage, and there was little to no opportunity to challenge the Government on their supposed &#8216;advantages of Brexit included in the report. (You can watch my full response <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbYQGRBVD3Y&amp;ab_channel=DrewHendry">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The report is over 100 pages yet fails to acknowledge the catastrophic impacts of Brexit on businesses and households. It offers no solutions or answers. The report lists&#8217; cheaper holidays in the EU&#8217; as a flagship Brexit achievement. Hundreds of thousands of families are struggling to find the money to pay for fuel to drive to work because of the tory costs of living crisis &#8211; never mind holiday abroad.</p>
<p>The report goes on to celebrate the fact that Brexit is &#8216;Saving UK consumers money by allowing them to do more of their shopping duty-free.&#8217; Again, talking up high-end shopping in airports when more and more folk can&#8217;t even afford to do their weekly food shop shows just how out of touch this UK Government are. Where&#8217;s the part of the report that acknowledges Brexit&#8217;s impact on prices; where&#8217;s the solution from this Government?</p>
<p>Of course, there was enough space in the report for an entire section dedicated to  &#8216;Global Britain&#8217;. Yet, it is hard to remember a time when the UK&#8217;s reputation was so much in tatters.</p>
<p>These two documents sum up Westminster &#8211; and why we now need to make our own decisions, here, in Scotland.</p>
<p>I will keep highlighting the severe impact of the cost of living crisis and the energy price hike on your families. I also want to remind you all that if there is anything you think I may be able to help your family with, please get in touch with my office. While I cannot promise to fix the problem, my team and I will do all we can to help or point you in the right direction. Please don&#8217;t suffer alone – support is out there.</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>

<p>Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&#8217;s long overdue &#8220;Levelling Up&#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham. </p>



<p>Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.</p>



<p>“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.</p>



<p>“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.</p>



<p>“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.</p>



<p>“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.</p>



<p>“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.</p>



<p>“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.</p>



<p>“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”</p>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit update:</span></strong></p>
<p>Time is now getting very tight for a future partnership with the EU to be negotiated, agreed, ratified and in place in time for the end of the Transition period on 31 December 2020. The expectation seems to be that a deal will be done in the next few days or not at all (or at least not until next year).</p>
<p>The issues seem to be much the same as in my last update, namely fishing, equivalence of regulatory standards between the UK and the EU (the so called level playing field) and state aid rules. I&nbsp; have set out a summary of the these issues and potential areas of compromise below.</p>
<p>I remain of the view that the best way forward for the UK would be to agree a good deal with the EU covering not just trade but also security, law and order, travel rights for citizens etc. That said, if we can’t agree a deal which respects our right to govern ourselves than we should walk away. I have seen no sign that the Government will give up this key red line but equally there will need to be some compromises to achieve a deal. Avoiding tariffs on imports and exports is a huge prize that will make the move out of the EU much smoother. As vice-chair of the Select Committee scrutinising the negotiations with the EU, I have been examining many of the key issues for the negotiations and our preparedness– you can see the details <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-exiting-the-european-union">here</a> – and I am looking forward to in depth scrutiny of any deal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Main outstanding issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing is a totemic Brexit issue, and out fishing industry has suffered especially badly over the last 40 years. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to rebuild our industry and catch a much higher proportion of the fish in our waters. Of course this means that EU fishing communities will lose out. The arguments are around how the quotas for each type of fish are calculated and how they are allocated between UK and EU fleets, with the UK wanting the default position under international maritime agreements of annual negotiations and the EU wanting to a long term agreement that retains most of their current access. The further challenge is that much of the fish caught in UK waters is exported to the EU. In reality it will take us many years to increase our fishing fleet and processing capacity so it would seem to me that a deal could be found based around gradual reductions in EU access to our waters via some form of transition.</li>
<li>The EU’s original negotiation position on the level playing field demanded dynamic alignment ie the UK would have to follow not just current EU rules but whatever they changed them to in key areas like environment, workers rights, taxation etc. In their view this would prevent us competing unfairly with them. This demand was very different to the wording agreed in the Political Declaration agreed a year ago which envisaged a non-regression clause ie we would not reduce key regulatory standards below the levels as at 31 December 2020. We could clearly never agree to blindly follow future EU rules over which we had no say. The discussion appears to have reverted back to non-regression clauses but with issues over how either side could enforce action against any breaches. Given that we are strengthening environmental standards and already go further than the EU rules in many areas on workers rights, I would not be too concerned about agreeing not to reduce standards in these areas. It would then seem possible to agree that if either side did make fundamental changes, the other side could give notice to terminate the trade deal either entirely on in part if they considered the issue serious enough.</li>
<li>State Aid rules restrict how much subsidy Governments can give to businesses. Currently if the UK government wishes to provide State Aid, we, like all EU members, need permission from the EU Commission. They also review whether policies like low tax rates or exemptions effectively represent State Aid. The UK has generally not been keen on State Aid in comparison to many other EU countries. Originally the EU seemed to want the UK to remain subject to the EU rules – clearly we could not as an independent country be in a position of following EU rules and especially not seeking permission from the EU. The talk seem to have progressed now to the UK being willing to set out rules which hare equivalent to EU ones on where State Aid can be used (indeed the WTO requires such rules anyway) but the dispute remains how these rules will be enforced so a UK government couldn’t just ignore them. The proposal seems to be for some sort of independent regulator but it strikes me that again, in extremis, giving notice to cancel the trade&nbsp; agreement would be an effective remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest Covid-19 guidance:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find the current Covid-19 guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">here</a>, along with the support available for residents (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>) and businesses (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">here</a>). The latest business grants for businesses affected by the recent restrictions are now available through the local Council, which you can find <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/covid-19-business-grants/">here</a>.

<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Defence Spending update:&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Last week, the Prime Minister announced an additional £24.1 billion in funding for our country&#8217;s defence, to help safeguard our security and revitalise our shipbuilding industry. Over the next four years, this investment will create 10,000 extra jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is the largest investment in our defence industry in the last 30 years and&nbsp;</span>will allow the Government to invest in cutting-edge technology &#8211;&nbsp;positioning the UK as a global leader in domains such as cyber and space and cementing the UK’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I welcomed this update, and the increased investment, during the subsequent debate on it in the House. I also highlighted the need to spend this additional money wisely and efficiently, and buy from British suppliers wherever possible. You can find the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-19a.487.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g501.6">here</a>&nbsp;and read more about the investment <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secures-largest-investment-since-the-cold-war">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Parliament:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In Parliament I&#8217;ve continued my work on anti-corruption and pensions, with questions in the House on preventing economic crime to further reduce corruption. You can find my question to the Chancellor in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-09b.619.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g627.3">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">With a local focus, I&#8217;ve also highlighted the importance of supporting the recovery of our high streets from the challenges caused by Covid-19, with one example being the recent announcement of the closure of many Argos stores, including the one in Alfreton. I know many independent retailers are also struggling (even though they&#8217;ve come up with many innovative ways to continue trading during this time), and so I will continue to raise this issue. You can find my most recent question in Parliament <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-05c.483.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g488.2">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Lastly, on a positive note, I welcomed the announcement of an additional bank holiday for the Queen&#8217;s platinum jubilee, and raised the issue of support or grants for community groups to hopefully be able to organise events to commemorate and celebrate this big event &#8211; you can find more on this debate <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-12b.1086.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1093.3">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pension Schemes Bill:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Earlier this month, I also contributed to a debate in Parliament on the new Pensions Schemes Bill, which continues to progress through the Houses (you can find out more about the bill <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/" data-cke-saved-href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8693/">here</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">As a member of the Work &amp; Pensions Select Committee, I&#8217;ve been working on this Bill, and I took the opportunity of the debate in the Commons on the latest stage to highlight various amendments I was supporting, including the importance of encouraging a greater take-up of&nbsp;independent free guidance to help people decide which pension option&nbsp;is best for them, scam prevention measures, improving pension dashboards and encouraging pension funds to support investment in climate goals and positive social activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">I&#8217;m really keen for to make pensions guidance as close to mandatory as possible, for instance through auto-enrolment onto the pensions dashboard, as the current take-up of the free, good quality advice provided by Pensions Wise guidance service is very low. I will continue to push the Government to introduce measures to improve and promote usage of pensions advice services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">You can find my speeches in full, and the rest of the debate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-11-16b.55.2&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g68.1">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select Committees:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;">In other Work &amp; Pensions Committee inquiries, we&#8217;re looking into Universal Credit and the wait for a first payment, the disability employment gap and DWP&#8217;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the use of foodbanks and support available for people experiencing food and fuel poverty (which you can find more on <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/164/work-and-pensions-committee/news/130962/committee-holds-session-on-support-for-people-claiming-benefits/">here</a>).

<p>The Lights in Andover is one of 10 additional GP-led vaccination sites opening up in Hampshire over the next couple of days to deliver the lifesaving vaccine to the most vulnerable.  </p>



<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients. You can find further information about the vaccination programme on the NHS website. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccination-programme/?fbclid=IwAR1fpUmKNp4yRr6QmFb7LJiCh5LvoLTJx6-Qah39dx87VAq6ASeUi1ZiApM" target="_blank">https://www.england.nhs.uk/&#8230;/covid-19-vaccination&#8230;/</a>This is more progress on the path to recovery and a bit of good news as we keep up the fight against C-19. </p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>"I'm delighted that, in the last 24 hours, the Shropshire NHS Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed to me that the new GP surgery in Shifnal will go ahead this year.  The building plans are well advanced and NHS England has provided the extra funding needed.  Local councillors and Shifnal Matters 2021 have supported me in pushing for this new surgery, and I'm glad that the NHS has listened to local needs."</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
