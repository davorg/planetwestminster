<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing with a further update on the coronavirus pandemic and to let you know that unfortunately our area has been moved into the highest Tier 3 of coronavirus restrictions. This decision has been taken because there has been a sharp increase in the number of infections locally and a big jump in the number of patients with Covid in our local hospitals.</p>
<p>This is where you can find the latest figures for infections in our area <a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/people-and-community/emergency-planning-and-community-safety/coronavirus/alert-levels-and-local-outbreak-plan/figures-and-statistics/daily-data"><strong>here</strong>.</a></p>
<p><strong>Tier 3 Rules</strong></p>
<p>These are the rules that apply in Tier 3 areas:</p>
<p>• you must not meet socially indoors or in most outdoor places with anybody you do not live with, or who is not in your support bubble, this includes in any private garden or at most outdoor venues<br />
• you must not socialise in a group of more than 6 in some other outdoor public spaces, including parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, a public garden, grounds of a heritage site or castle, or a sports facility – this is called the ‘rule of 6’<br />
• hospitality settings, such as bars (including shisha venues), pubs, cafes and restaurants are closed – they are permitted to continue sales by takeaway, click-and-collect, drive-through or delivery services.<br />
• accommodation such as hotels, B&amp;Bs, campsites, and guest houses must close. There are several exemptions, such as for those who use these venues as their main residence, and those requiring the venues where it is reasonably necessary for work or education and training<br />
• indoor entertainment and tourist venues must close.</p>
<p>This includes:<br />
• indoor play centres and areas, including trampolining parks and soft play<br />
• casinos<br />
• bingo halls<br />
• bowling alleys<br />
• skating rinks<br />
• amusement arcades and adult gaming centres<br />
• laser quests and escape rooms<br />
• cinemas, theatres and concert halls<br />
• snooker halls<br />
• indoor attractions at mostly outdoor entertainment venues must also close (indoor shops, through-ways and public toilets at such attractions can remain open). This includes indoor attractions within:<br />
• zoos, safari parks, and wildlife reserves<br />
• aquariums, visitor attractions at farms, and other animal attractions<br />
• model villages<br />
• museums, galleries and sculpture parks<br />
• botanical gardens, biomes or greenhouses<br />
• theme parks, circuses, fairgrounds and funfairs<br />
• visitor attractions at film studios, heritage sites such as castles and stately homes<br />
• landmarks including observation decks and viewing platforms<br />
• leisure and sports facilities may continue to stay open, but group exercise classes (including fitness and dance) should not go ahead.<br />
• there should be no public attendance at spectator sport or indoor performances and large business events should not be taking place. Elite sport events may continue to take place without spectators<br />
• large outdoor events (performances and shows) should not take place, with the exception of drive-in events<br />
• places of worship remain open, but you must not attend with or socialise with anyone outside of your household or support bubble while you are there, unless a legal exemption applies<br />
• weddings and funerals can go ahead with restrictions on the number of attendees – 15 people can attend wedding ceremonies, wedding receptions are not allowed, 30 people can attend funeral ceremonies, 15 people can attend linked commemorative events<br />
• organised outdoor sport, and physical activity and exercise classes can continue, however higher-risk contact activity should not take place<br />
• organised indoor sport, physical activity and exercise classes cannot take place indoors. There are exceptions for indoor disability sport, sport for educational purposes and supervised sport and physical activity for under-18s<br />
• you can continue to travel to venues or amenities which are open, but should aim to reduce the number of journeys you make where possible<br />
• avoid travelling outside of your area, including for overnight stays other than where necessary, such as for work, education, youth services, to receive medical treatment, or because of caring responsibilities. You can travel through other areas as part of a longer journey<br />
• for international travel see the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office travel advice for your destination and the travel corridors list</p>
<p>There are more details <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tier-3-very-high-alert">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Exemptions </strong></p>
<p>There are some exemptions from these conditions, which do not apply:</p>
<p>• to a single household, or a support bubble<br />
• for work or providing voluntary or charitable services, including in other people’s homes<br />
• for childcare, education or training – meaning education and training provided as part of a formal curriculum<br />
• for supervised activities provided for children, including wraparound care (before and after-school childcare), groups and activities for under 18s, and children’s playgroups<br />
• for formal support groups, and parent and child groups – up to 15 people aged 5 and older<br />
• to allow contact between birth parents and children in care, as well as between siblings in care<br />
• for arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardians<br />
• for prospective adopting parents to meet a child or children who may be placed with them<br />
• for birth partners<br />
• to attend a funeral – with no more than 30 people present – or a commemorative event such as a wake for someone who has died – with no more than 15 people present<br />
• to see someone who is terminally ill or at the end of life<br />
• to attend a wedding or civil partnership – with no more than 15 people present<br />
• to provide emergency assistance<br />
• to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm<br />
• to fulfil a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury service<br />
• to provide care or assistance to someone vulnerable or to provide respite for a carer<br />
• to facilitate moving home</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Bubbles</strong></p>
<p>Many people will still be uncertain what to do over Christmas. While people are still free to get together with family or friends for Christmas in a bubble of up to three households, for a five day period from the 23rd to the 27th of December, everyone is being asked to take great care. The virus is spreading fast at the moment, and although the vaccination programme has now started, it will take some time before all vulnerable groups have had the jab. So the message is to take great care and avoid taking any steps which might risk infecting an elderly relative in particular.</p>
<p>The full guidance is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-a-christmas-bubble-with-friends-and-family/making-a-christmas-bubble-with-friends-and-family">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination Process</strong></p>
<p>A few people have asked me about how the vaccination process will work. There is a set programme of vaccinations, and it is being done primarily by age group.</p>
<p>This is the latest information about the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/">programme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom Choral Society</strong></p>
<p>The Epsom Choral Society has asked me to let you know that whilst it cannot do its usual Christmas concert this year, it will be streaming a concert live on Saturday 19th December at 5pm. Everyone is welcome to tune in. Details are at www.epsomchoral.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p>Finally I wanted to thank everyone locally who has helped out in our community in difficult times this year. It has been a really tough year for many people, but it has also been a time when people really have been turning out to look after neighbours and the vulnerable. It is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Commenting on the news this afternoon that the Chancellor has extended the furlough scheme by another month, South Lakes MP Tim Farron said:</p>
<p>
  <em>"This is a very welcome move from the Chancellor</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"He must now extend the support for the self-employed, including those he has excluded from any support since this crisis began back in March.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"The self-employed, who make up around 1 in 4 of all workers in the South Lakes, are the entrepreneurs that we need to help rebuild our economy - they must not be forgotten."</em>

<p><strong>Commenting that Greater Manchester is to remain in Tier 3, Andrew Gwynne MP said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Two weeks ago I voted against the tiering system because I don’t think it’s the right approach to defeating this virus. We now seem trapped in Tier 3, no matter what.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It arbitrarily closes hospitality businesses who were responsible for just 3% of transmissions whilst keeping open many of the settings we know are responsible for the spread of the virus.  I really feel for those pubs, bars and restaurants who were hoping for a chink of light at the end of a very dark tunnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our rates in Tameside and Stockport are falling, thanks to the efforts of so many, but this feels like the Government is so nervous about the mess they’ve made of the Christmas relaxation rules, that we are being pre-emptively punished ahead of any new year spike.”</p></blockquote>

As we approach an altogether different Christmas from what we are used to, I think it is important to say thank you and pay tribute to all those that have made great sacrifices to keep us safe throughout the year. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">For many this has been a year of sadness and loss, loss of loved ones and a feeling that our futures have been put at risk with the economy taking such hard knocks. There will be thousands of businesses that closed their doors for good during the pandemic and a full social and economic recovery will undoubtedly be a long process. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">However, there are positives to take from 2020. In this unprecedented year full of challenges and unpredictability we have also seen the very best of people. A community spirit that many thought lost in time has been rejuvenated with mutual aid and citizens alliance networks across Barking and Dagenham and Havering. Neighbours looking out for one another and protecting the most vulnerable in our society. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">There are genuine signs of hope appearing as we come to the end of this difficult period. Scientists around the world have worked successfully to produce vaccines, and with a global roll out round the corner normality does not seem too far away. That is why it is all the more important that we do not give a platform to ‘Covid deniers’ or give way to the voices of anti-vaxxers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Despite the uncertainty and subsequent economic challenges, Dagenham and Rainham has not been without success stories and is in a strong position to weather the storm. Just last month Barking and Dagenham announced their delivery partner for London’s largest film studio which will bring Hollywood investment to Dagenham East, and plans were approved earlier in the year to relocate London’s three historic markets to Dagenham Dock. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">As we move into 2021, I will continue working to support local people, businesses, and voluntary organisations throughout Dagenham and Rainham. I also plan to keep the pressure on central government and will continue campaigning for greater investment in public services, improved healthcare and opportunities for our young people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Finally, I want to extend warm wishes to families across Dagenham, Rainham, South Hornchurch and Elm Park this Christmas, and all the best for a happy and healthy new year. Whilst it looks like Covid guidance will be relaxed over the holiday period, I would still urge caution and encourage residents to behave in a responsible way that keeps all in our community safe.</p>

<p>My speech during the debate on the Taxation (Post-transition Period) Bill, 15 December 2020</p>



<p>I rise to support what may be an amendment that we are going to vote on or may be a probing amendment from my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash), because I think there has been a deliberate misunderstanding by the EU and its friends over what Brexit is about and what we need to do in order to achieve a proper Brexit. A proper Brexit is taking back control; it is recreating the sovereignty of the people of the United Kingdom through their Parliament.</p>



<p>&nbsp;My hon. Friend has a distinguished career in this place trying to rebuild that sovereignty and watching, year after year, more and more of our powers taken away by successive treaties, by successive directives and regulations, many of them automatic ones over which the UK had little or no influence, and by court judgments which, again, we had precious little ability to shape. He is right that, as we come to legislate for our new arrangements as a sovereign country from 1 January next year, we need to make quite sure that we have back under the control of people and Parliament all those powers that we need to regulate, to govern and to take wise decisions on behalf of the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>I am very worried about some elements of the withdrawal agreement. I was told, as we were all told, that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed, and that that meant the future relationship as well as the withdrawal agreement. The EU decided for its own convenience to sequence things and say, “You have to sign the withdrawal agreement first and then the future relationship agreement will follow.” A bit of flesh was put on the bones of the future relationship in the so-called political declaration, which one would have thought there was a lot of moral pressure to go along with even if it was not as strictly legally binding as they hoped the withdrawal agreement would be. I now think there has been a lot of bad faith, because, according to both sides, the central feature of the future relationship was always going to be a free trade agreement, and where is the free trade agreement?</p>



<p>&nbsp;We now discover that the EU wishes to take all sorts of other powers away from us as the price for the free trade agreement, which we have already overpaid for in the withdrawal agreement and which one would have thought, in good faith, the EU would now grant. It is very much in its interests—even more than it is in our interests—given the huge imbalance in trade, and above all in the trade that would attract tariffs if we had no free trade agreement: the trade in food. That is really what we are talking about: are there going to be tariffs on food or not?</p>



<p>We, the United Kingdom, run a colossal £20 billion trade deficit with the EU on food. We have to impose pretty high tariffs on food from the rest of the world—that makes absolutely no sense where we could not grow any of it ourselves; it may have some benefit for some of our farmers some of the time—but we are not allowed to put any similar tariffs on EU-sourced produce where we could produce it ourselves. The EU system is to try to use tariffs to buttress domestic production, but it has not worked for the United Kingdom; it has worked the other way. The tariffs have been taken off in order to benefit the Dutch, Spanish, French or Irish suppliers of our market with food at zero tariffs. The EU already has rather more interest in tariff withdrawal than we do, because we could have a range of tariffs that would probably achieve the aims both of cutting food prices by having a lower average tariff and of having a bit more protection on the things that we really could make and grow for ourselves here, which we are not allowed to protect against continental products at the moment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I therefore think that the Bill could be improved by reminding the EU that we will not be pushed around and we will not suffer too much bad faith from those original negotiations or from the withdrawal agreement itself. I think it was a very imperfect agreement. It is pretty ambiguous in places; it is imprecise in places. I have never felt that anything the Government have done, or thought of doing, was in any way illegal. Lawyers could make a perfectly good case under the withdrawal agreement treaty terms themselves, and anyway, we have the protection of my hon. Friend’s section 38, which made it very clear that this Parliament’s acceptance of the withdrawal agreement was conditional. Why else would anyone have put section 38 in the withdrawal agreement Act unless they were making a point?</p>



<p><strong>Sir William Cash (Stone) (Con):</strong> Does my right hon. Friend appreciate that it was the Prime Minister who, after an eight-hour meeting I had in No. 10 that day—17 October 2019—insisted that section 38 was necessary and appropriate? If we go back to the previous Administration, just imagine where we would be when we consider the Chequers arrangements, and then imagine what it would have been like if we had not decided to vote against that dreadful withdrawal agreement in its original shape. There were provisions that needed to be rectified, and section 38 provides the mechanism that enables us to do that.</p>



<p><strong>John Redwood:</strong> Indeed. I think my hon. Friend has confirmed that under the previous Prime Minister, when those of us who could not vote for her agreement said that we needed a sovereignty escape clause, we were told that that would not be permissible because it would not be effective implementation of the agreement; which was then reassuring to us, not liking the withdrawal agreement very much and realising that it was a provisional agreement and would be completed only were there to be a satisfactory outcome to the total range of talks. It was a totally artificial constraint that the EU invented that it had to be sequenced, when up until that point everybody had always rightly said that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.</p>



<p> I would like to hear from the Minister a little more explanation on the detail of the Bill. As I understand it, the Northern Ireland protocol would apply only to goods that are passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and then on to the Republic of Ireland, or the reverse—goods coming from the Republic to Northern Ireland and then passing on to Great Britain. </p>



<p>Am I right in thinking that that is a very small proportion of the total trade? In what ways will the Government ensure that it is properly defined, so that we do not catch up most goods in those more elaborate procedures?  The bulk of the trade will be GB to Northern Ireland and back, or Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland and back, and it should not in any way be caught up in any of these proposals. </p>



<p>I am not sure that we do have a de minimis way of dealing with the so-called things at risk. It is not clear how the system will work for items at risk where we agree that they are at risk—and I hope it is a UK decision about what is a risk, not some other kind of decision with EU inspectors. It would be helpful to me and the wider community interested in this debate to know how a business would proceed if it had such a good at risk, to whom it would answer, and what decisions would be made about such a good in Excise, because it sounds a rather complicated and difficult arrangement, both for the business concerned and for those who are trying to enforce. I am trying to tease out from the Minister, in pursuit of the interests of my hon. Friend the Member for Stone and myself on sovereignty, whether we are really in control if the trade has started off from GB and is going to Northern Ireland. </p>



<p>What kind of external intervention can the EU or the Republic of Ireland engineer—how is that fair, and how will it be determined? I think that is what we are most worried about in this piece of legislation, and we would be more reassured if there were the override that my hon. Friend proposes. I should be grateful for some explanation.</p>

This week the government has reviewed the tiers in England for the COVID-19 social contact restrictions. Not only is Kent staying within tier 3, but the whole of London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire have been included as well. I know that this will be disappointing for very many people who would have hoped [&#8230;]

<p>The MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, has welcomed that Holderness Health in his constituency is one of the first GP practices to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination against Covid-19 to their most vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>The UK became the first country in the world to approve the vaccine on 2nd December, when the independent Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency gave it the go-ahead. The NHS is now in the process of delivering the largest programme of immunisation in the country’s history, and subsequently announced that Castle Hill Hospital would act as a vaccine hub to protect the most vulnerable patients and healthcare staff in the region.</p>
<p>Now, GP practices are being added to the list of sites approved to administer the vaccine, despite health bosses having to contend with the practicalities of storing and transporting the vaccine, which must be stored between -80°C and -60°C and given to patients within six hours of being thawed.</p>
<p>As a result, Holderness Health has been chosen as one of four local Covid-19 vaccination centres in Hull and the East Riding, with more practices joining on a phased basis over the course of the coming months. The first GP-led vaccinations were carried out at Holderness Health yesterday afternoon (14th December).</p>
<p>Patients over the age of 80 with the greatest clinical risk are being offered appointments first, with priority groups determined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination &amp; Immunisation. Eventually, mass vaccinations will be offered in sports venues and conference centres once further vaccine supplies become available.</p>
<p>Graham commented, “This is fantastic news for vulnerable constituents in Beverley and Holderness, who will be among the first to be offered this vaccination by their family GPs.</p>
<p>“I know Holderness Health have plenty of experience in delivering safe and effective vaccination programmes, as they do every year with the flu jab, so I have every confidence that they will rise to the challenge despite its scale and complexity.</p>
<p>“The public can really help with this by not contacting the surgery to ask for a jab, because eligible people will be proactively contacted by phone, letter, or the national booking system.”</p>
<p>For it to be effective, people are required to have two doses of the vaccine 3 weeks apart and the NHS is urging people to ensure that they book their jabs when contacted and are emphasising the importance of attending both appointments: Dr Craig Dobson, medical advisor to the East Riding CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) said, “The vaccine has been shown to be effective and it is fantastic news that in our local area we can start to vaccinate our more vulnerable residents, who need it most.</p>
<p>“If you are in one of the priority groups, I would urge that when your GP Practice contacts you, please make sure you book and attend your appointments when you arrange them.”</p>

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP Angus MacNeil has contacted NHS Western Isles today seeking an update on the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in Uist and Barra.</p>



<p>The first Pfizer vaccinations were administered in Stornoway at the end of last week and Mr MacNeil has been contacted by constituents in Uist and Barra looking for detail on when this will be rolled out more widely.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: &#8220;It was great to see the vaccination programme start in the islands and many Health board care workers from all ends of the Hebrides have been vaccinated.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is however obvious and understandable concern about the possibility of delays in the distribution of the vaccine to the communities in Uist and Barra and I have contacted NHS Western Isles for more detail on this today.</p>



<p>&#8220;The arrival of the vaccine in the Western Isles was an historic day and I commend NHS Western Isles staff for their efforts to get this underway.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope, and I expect, that any challenges which have arisen can be addressed as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last Saturday I spent the day on the Wales Co-operative Council Zoom call meeting. As a Labour and Co-operative Party MP, I presented a report on the activities of the Parliamentary Co-operative Group over the past two months. We have been very active. We have drawn the attention to the need for free school meals during holiday periods in England, which are provided in Wales, and the UK Government eventually climbed down. International development and fair trade is a key co-operative value and we have called for this to be at the heart of any future trade deals. We opposed the merging of the Department for International Development into the FCO, and voiced our objection to the abolishment of the International Trade Select Committee. We have continued to campaign to give shop workers greater protection against violence and abuse they suffer at work. At our Co-operative Party Local Government Conference our Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds announced that we will be working together on a Labour and Co-operative Recovery Partnership, towards a Labour and Co-operative Government.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, as chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Vegetarians and Vegans, I hosted a virtual event about food security. The World Food Summit of 1996 defined food security as existing when “all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious, food to maintain a healthy, active life”. During the Coronavirus pandemic issues around access to food have become more widespread. With many people losing their jobs or being paid less, the number of people using food banks has increased. We heard from people in communities involved in helping people with restricted diets access suitable foods during this pandemic. Speakers included, a vegan food bank, The Vegetarian Society and V for Life. It was a pleasure to welcome Baroness Anita Gale, former General Secretary of Welsh Labour, and a lifelong vegetarian to become a member of the APPG.</p>
<p>On Monday evening I joined the <a href="https://ukabif.org.uk/news/542352/-UKABIF-participates-in-All-Party-Parliamentary-Group-Roundtable-on-COVID-19.htm">All Party Parliamentary Group for Acquired Brain Injury Roundtable</a> discussion on Covid-19 rehabilitation and neurological conditions. Speakers from the Neurological Alliance, Parkinson’s UK, MS Society, SUDEP Action, MND Association, Epilepsy Action, and the UK Acquired Brain Injury Forum discussed the impact of Covid-19 on people with neurological conditions and the need for increased access and provision of rehabilitation services during this pandemic and into the future.</p>
<p>The Sepsis APPG, of which I am the chair, works closely with the UK Sepsis Trust who are investigating the strong link between Sepsis and Long-Covid. Both of these conditions require rehabilitation services and should be joined with rehabilitation services for other high risk conditions such as those discussed in the Roundtable.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, as vice chair of the <a href="https://hs-8074033.t.hubspotstarter-h6.net/e2t/tc/VVY6FH7tvG03W27wqRj3K6B2HW2z6fd_4kswX2N2L_pzS3lGnpV1-WJV7CgVTZW4NK-f76vmxSKW8SctfR28RdzVW7146t11Dtp3xW1ZMNVL1-4l6hW2ZV9Pj5VGv4lW1W9jfK6s03fKV6tzPs5BYjxnVjQHrl4-K-vnVY4tNd3h34kCVmtfQL7y-BfZW3z2C1y8wnP3bW6VZbGm9bwfDQVD7pQx6BjTS4W5dG-1Q6fqt7dW48ybB668PbWnVJRbj_4sDWVsW1hDvWL4Sr3RXN5V2BpdF6xMNW7MD-n58kR72-VV9mZ64_5qShW5vXRsT4RmNrwW7Dc1q24VY64ZW6fBNqC4c48TnW40nffn24YKl2W4JqKkD8Bp8Z5W49wSDz91DLHr34qy1">APPG for Gaps in Support</a>, I joined its meeting addressed by Metro Mayors Dan Jarvis MP, Sheffield City Region, Steve Rotherham, Liverpool City Region, and Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester Region. They spoke about being in the highest COVID-19 restrictions in England, how this had affected the people and communities they represent and about their campaigns to secure funds from UK Government for those who had fallen through the gaps. This APPG probably has the largest membership in Parliament and represents the people and businesses who are excluded from UK Government support schemes.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening I joined the last ever Parliamentary Mindfulness session, virtually. Some eight years ago my dear friend Chris Ruane, former MP for Vale of Clwyd, teamed up with the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre and organised drop in sessions, courses and retreats for MPs, Peers and Parliamentary staff. The sessions were run by the Oxford Mindfulness Foundation, which is a charity for the research, teaching and education of mindfulness, focusing on well being and resilience. Unfortunately the funding has run out. Over the years, over 250 parliamentarians and 500 staff have taken part in these sessions and we will all miss the opportunity to come together and support each other trying to cope with the stress and challenges of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I joined the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group zoom meeting. The General Secretary of the Co-operative Party, Joe Fortune, and his Political and Parliamentary Officer, Rob Bates, gave us an update on plans for future activities and campaigns. We will continue to support Alex Norris MP’s Private Members Bill protecting shop workers from violence and abuse in work when it returns to be debated when Friday Sittings are resumed; amend forthcoming legislation; ask oral questions; and set down written questions to pursue co-operative values.</p>
<p>I was drawn on the Call List for the Westminster Hall debate “That this House has Considered support for people ineligible for UK Government COVID-19 Support Schemes” scheduled for 4:30pm, and was going to speak about the rigid, inflexible, criteria and rules attached to the UK Government support schemes which has resulted in 3 million people being excluded from support during this pandemic. And how the Chancellor has not corrected these gaps. Whereas the Welsh Government has plugged holes in the Chancellor’s schemes and created its own, so that businesses in Welsh communities continue to trade and workers spend locally, giving our high streets the best chance of surviving. However, I was summoned to chair in Westminster Hall from 4pm for the rest of the sitting, and did not therefore speak in the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/1d9ad65f-923b-47cb-946f-c463eb5e30ab">debate</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning I chaired the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/a9509d52-5d67-485d-bdbf-841ca78d526b">Fifteenth Delegated Legislation Committee</a> which considered two Statutory Instruments amending the Draft Health and Social Care Act 2008 in respect of Coronavirus regulations in England. The aim of both instruments is to establish consistent regulation for all providers in the rapidly expanding COVID-19 testing market and aim to make it quicker for new test providers to gain certification and start providing testing services. After discussions by members of the committee, both instruments were unanimously approved.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I chaired a <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/28ba4159-070b-485a-8516-8f91fcaf990e">Westminster Hall debate</a> on UK – Qatar Relations led by Alistair Carmichael MP in which members discussed the merits of continuing this relationship for the benefit of the UK.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Today the government unveiled its Cultural Kickstart Fund which will help cultural organisations who have lost funding as a result of the pandemic and ensure major capital projects can go ahead as planned.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Worcester Arches Project is one of 74 organisations receiving grants from government totalling £58.9million today. The regeneration of the historic arches in the city will be assisted by a grant of £145,915 to help turn them into a modern workspace for creative industries, and transport links that will help connect the city.</span></span></p>
<p><a name="_Hlk58586972"></a><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The wider scheme which amounts to around £4.5 million of investment is being delivered by Worcester Cultural Partnership, made up of Worcester City Council, the University of Worcester, Severn Arts, The Arch Company and Worcestershire County Council. Local MP Robin Walker has welcomed the additional funding announced today, stating that the investment has the potential to reinvigorate the area around the arches.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Capital Kickstart grants programme helps organisations cover costs added to capital projects such as building works, refurbishments, and large-scale equipment purchases by pandemic-related delays or fundraising shortfalls.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The announcement follows a series of investments in Worcester cultural sites with Museums Worcester and Worcester Cathedral both receiving support from the fund earlier in the year.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Commenting, Robin said:</span></b><br />
<a name="_Hlk58587181"></a><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">“To a historic city like Worcester our heritage and cultural assets are vitally important, and I am delighted that the government is taking protecting those sites seriously. A lot of cultural organisations have taken a hit as a result of the Covid pandemic so it is important that they are provided with the funding they need to continue the work they do.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">“The Worcester Arches Project in particular will reinvigorate the iconic arches as well as the area around it, providing a pedestrian link from Foregate Street Station then on to the river. We have the opportunity to make this cultural site a real draw for people into the town, which will in turn support the businesses that are working to provide for them.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">“I have worked alongside fellow Conservatives at Worcester City Council to highlight the importance of the Arches’ regeneration and today’s announcement is a clear signal that the government are listening.”</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden said:</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">“When the Culture Recovery Fund launched, I said I would not let the cultural sector down and I have kept my word with more than £1 billion now allocated to organisations who need it most.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">“We have funded organisations of every size in all corners of the country, and now we are extending a huge helping hand to some of the country’s biggest cultural powerhouses to get them through the Covid crisis too.”</span></span></p>

<p>Artwork featuring the best entries to our Annual MP / MS Christmas Card Competition will be on display from tomorrow (Saturday, 12<sup>th</sup> December) in the St Elli Shopping Centre adding some much-needed cheer to the town during the festive period.</p>



<p>Shoppers will be able to see eye-catching designs from
youngsters across the Llanelli constituency including from pupils from Ysgol
Llannon, Swiss Valley Primary, Ysgol Y Castell, Ysgol Gymunedol Bancffosfelen,
Burry Port Primary and Ysgol Y Felin.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The centrepiece of the exhibition will be the winning designs
from Mia Emoka of Ysgol Llannon who won the Infants category and Megan-Lily
Killick who picked up the prize for the best Junior entry.</p>



<p>It has been a pleasure to see that even after all the
upheaval of the last few months, so many children taking part in the
competition and submitting colourful and optimistic entries.</p>



<p>2020 has been a tough year for many people but we hope that the display will bring a little bit of extra happiness to Llanelli not only to those whose work will feature on it but also to anyone who takes the time to pop along and appreciate the wonderful work of our local young people.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&nbsp;UK&nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’</p>

<p>Last week we were all delighted at the news that the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>I am therefore equally pleased that the vaccine has now arrived in the West Midlands and in the Borough of Walsall.</p>
<p>No one underestimates the extent of the challenge ahead of us to roll out the vaccine to the whole population, but we now have light at the end of the tunnel and a route map out of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It is important however to remember and recognise thought that whilst the vaccine is being rolled out it remains we must continue to follow the rules as a Tier 3 area and observe the basics of – Hands, Face and Space! It is incumbent upon us all to continue to play our part in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>This has been an unprecedented year, and the effects of the pandemic have undoubtedly hit small businesses hard. That’s why I’m pledging to buy over 50% of my Christmas shopping from local businesses this year, and I want to encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Across the Highlands, over 90 per cent of registered businesses are small businesses, and whilst online purchases from large retailers have now become a way of life, I am asking people to consider a couple of simple strategies to help out locally. Could you find a Highland supplier to deliver to you, could you support a local venue, hotel or restaurant and buy a voucher, or could you give the gift of giving by donating to a local charity or group, in their name.</p>
<p>My team and I have pulled together a list of our favourite small businesses from across the constituency, and would like to encourage you to shop with them, and the many other small businesses this festive season:</p>

<p><strong>Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</strong></p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is encouraging all constituents to put safety first when shopping online for their Christmas presents this year.</p>
<p>With online marketplaces not bound by the same laws as traditional retailers, fake and dangerous electrical products are being sold to unknowing customers. Containing sub-standard or counterfeit parts, they present a serious risk of fire or electric shock.  In research conducted by Electrical Safety First, 14 out of 15 sampled products from third-party sellers failed basic safety tests.</p>
<p>Electrical Safety First are encouraging consumers to make sure you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller, to check packaging and the item carefully for tell-tale signs that the product is not genuine, and to check for safety certifications on labelling.</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth said: </strong></p>
<p>“With Covid restrictions still affecting everyday life, many constituents will be doing their Christmas shopping online this year.</p>
<p>“If you are planning on buying electrical goods please make sure that you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller. Avoid third-party sellers for electrical goods and if you are unsure at all when your product arrives, do not use it.</p>
<p>“I know it’s been a tough year and finances are tight, but it&#8217;s not worth risking fire and electrocution to save a few pounds”.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/12/04/bristol-south-mp-warns-constituents-about-electrical-safety-in-the-run-up-to-christmas/" target="_blank">Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday (Wed 2<sup>nd</sup> Dec) I was lucky enough to be drawn to ask a question during Prime Minister’s Question Time.</p>



<p>Seeing as it’s almost twelve months since Boris Johnson took the mantle of Prime Minister, I thought I’d remind him of this anniversary and challenge him on his record.</p>



<p>Just some of the ‘highlights’ of the Prime Minister’s tenure that I chose to remind him of were; 71,000 Covid-19 deaths, which tragically is the highest rate in Europe. We have seen our national debt balloon to two trillion pounds for first time ever, meaning we are now officially the worst performing economy in the G7. With just weeks to go, our Brexit negotiations are failing, and we face leaving the EU without a deal which would spell disaster for jobs and businesses. Finally, during the pandemic, the Government have given at least £1.5 billion of taxpayer’s money in contracts to Tory friends and donors and at the same time whipped his MPs to vote against feeding hungry children free school meals. It’s a record that any decent person should be ashamed of however, I asked the Prime Minister which of these achievements he was most proud of.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly the Prime Minister failed to answer my question, avoiding defending himself he dithered and blustered his was and attempted to criticise the Labour Party. During my time as an MP I have sat opposite three different Prime Ministers and whilst none have left with records to be proud of, we really have sunk to a new low with Boris Johnson.</p>

<p><strong>Question by John to the Chancellor and Minister for the Cabinet Office:</strong></p>



<p>With reference to the National Audit Office report on Government procurement during the covid-19 pandemic, published 18 November 2020, [I would like to ask] whether the same standard of due diligence checks was carried out on potential suppliers and contracts in the (a) high priority lane and (b) normal lane.</p>



<p><strong>Answer from Ministers:</strong></p>



<p>Being able to procure at speed has been critical in providing the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>We welcome the NAO report which recognises that the government ‘needed to procure with extreme urgency’ and ‘secured unprecedented volumes of essential supplies necessary to protect front-line workers’.</p>



<p>All contracts, including those designed to tackle coronavirus issues, must continue to achieve value for money for taxpayers, use good commercial judgement and the details of any awards made should be published as soon as possible in line with Government transparency guidelines.</p>



<p>Robust processes are in place for the award of government contracts. PPE offers were assessed using the same eight step process, including quality checks, price controls and other due diligence, no matter where the original referral came from. This eight step process has been published in the NAO’s report. For further details please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-government-procurement-following-this-weeks-nao-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on gov.uk.(opens in a new tab)</a></p>



<p>We are committed to transparency in public procurement. Details of central government contracts above £10,000 are published on Contracts Finder. We regret that some details have not been uploaded in a timely fashion. All will be published as soon as possible and significant information is already available online.</p>



<p>The forthcoming Green Paper on transforming the UK’s public procurement regulations will strengthen our longstanding and essential policies that are fundamental to public procurement including transparency, ensuring value for money and fair treatment of suppliers. As part of this, we will propose legislating to reinforce that contracting authorities would need to publish basic disclosure information, including the basis of award decisions.</p>



<p>We have always accepted that there are lessons to be learned from how we responded to this unprecedented global pandemic and the government is fully committed to doing so. We will address the NAO report’s recommendations in due course. As I stated in my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-11-12/debates/46D252DF-18D4-40EE-9AD5-0439F9106839/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-ED32E98C-15B1-4BEF-A267-47FB68033CDF" target="_blank">answer on 12 November (opens in a new tab)</a>, we are engaged in both internal and external audit to review how our procurements during this period have been conducted.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-heading-link-color-mariner-color">Responding to the answer from Government, John wrote on social media: &#8220;Got answers to my Questions on Government covid contracts. Good that all suppliers faced same quality checks no matter who recommended them, but publication backlog of contract details still needs fixing. Big post-brexit opportunity for faster, more digital &amp; transparent, less bureaucratic Government buying process so small firms can challenge big incumbents easily!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday (01/12/20), Parliament was presented with a simple, for or against, choice to vote on the renewed ‘Tier’ restrictions which have subsequently come into place this morning and the additional financial support package on offer to businesses, workers and households across Gateshead and the North East.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I wanted to take some time to explain my position on this matter and why I voted against the imposition of this package yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>At the outset, I absolutely agree with experts here in Gateshead and Nationally that we must prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout our communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>I also agree that the best way to do this is through limiting social interaction especially among meetings of multiple households.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The package of restrictions are not perfect, they appear to be ever more complicated and the allocation of tiers to different regions appears to be unequal at first glance, with areas in the North and North East subjected to greater levels of restrictions compared to other parts of the UK with similar or higher rates of incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>To this end, I have formally requested the Government publish the criteria used and set out some clarity on how regions will move between tiers while we await the rollout of a number of vaccine programmes.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The restrictions in place since the spring, closing large numbers of businesses across Gateshead and limiting the trade of so many others, have had an incredibly damaging impact on the lives and livelihoods and overall wellbeing of so many people.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government has a duty and the means to provide proper financial support to these businesses and their employees, and to this end, I firmly believe they have failed. While the initial business rate grant scheme and the furlough scheme seemed generous, many millions of people have been left without any support whatsoever and continue to be ignored 9 months on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>In addition, businesses in Gateshead which have either had to remain closed or have been once again forced to close – hospitality, fitness suites and retail particularly – alongside many self employed workers; have been left with meagre amounts of support, if any, as many businesses enter what would traditionally be their busiest trading period.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government appear to have prioritised funnelling billions of pounds of tax payer money into, sometimes selective, elements of the private sector to provide inadequate PPE and an ineffective test, track and trace system. Instead, they should be prioritising financial support for businesses, employees and families affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Failure to do so has not only had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of so many people, but it has had a detrimental impact on adherence to the restrictions. The Government must understand that many people can not work from home and do not have ready access to utilities and food, and many can not afford to withstand repeated periods of self isolation without proper financial support – Statutory Sick Pay is simply totally inadequate.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Notwithstanding the urgent need to restrict the spread of Covid-19, I voted against the motion yesterday evening, as I firmly believe the Government can and must do more to provide adequate financial support for every person and business affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have raised the inadequate financial support with the Government since the spring and will continue to do so until they meet their responsibility in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Now that the North East is officially subject to tier 3 restrictions, I would urge all residents to follow the rules closely, as this is the only way we can reduce the spread of the virus enough to move down the tier system. With our infection rates declining, because of everyone’s efforts and with positive news of vaccinations in the very near future, it is imperative that we all do whatever we can to further drive down the spread of Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I hope this sets out my view clearly, however, if you have any further questions please do contact my office.</span></p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>



<p>I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.</p>



<p>It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. </p>



<p>However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.</p>



<p>Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121<sup>st</sup>
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.</p>



<p>Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.</p>



<p>Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.</p>



<p>It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.</p>



<p>We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.</p>



<p>We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.</p>



<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely<br>Cllr David Mellen<br>Leader, Nottingham City Council</p>

<p>Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. </p>



<p>Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: </p>



<p>“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.</p>



<p>“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.</p>



<p>“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.</p>



<p>“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” </p>



<p>Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25<sup>th</sup> November. </p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>
