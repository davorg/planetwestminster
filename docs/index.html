<p>I’m pleased Boris Johnson has finally resigned. It’s the right decision for my constituents and the rest of the country.</p>
<div>But the truth is he should have gone a long time ago. His lies, broken promises and lack of basic decency and integrity have damaged Britain at home and abroad.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Whilst the Tories rip themselves apart and inflict chaos on the country, my constituents face a cost of living crisis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>People can’t pay their bills, rent or mortgages or afford the weekly shop. They can’t get a passport or driving licence, let alone an operation or an appointment to see their GP. And the Tories are scrabbling around like rats in a sack trying to save their own necks rather than sorting all these problems out. That’s before we even look at the bigger challenges Britain faces like climate change and global threats like that from Russia.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Tories have been in government for 12 long years. They are all culpable for the mess we face.</div>
<p>As Keir Starmer has rightly said, changing one person at the top of the Tory party isn’t anywhere near enough. We need a change of government and a fresh start for Britain.</p>

Jeremy Hunt announced he would stand to become Leader and so Prime Minister earlier on Sunday morning. Mr Dunne led Mr Hunt’s team in Parliament during the 2019 contest.<br /><br />
Mr Dunne said today:<br />
“Jeremy Hunt has the best mix of skills and experience to become Prime Minister overnight.<br /><br />
He has mastered senior Cabinet roles during almost ten years under previous Prime Ministers, serving as Culture Secretary for the London 2012 Olympics, the longest serving Health Secretary ever, and two years as Foreign Secretary.<br /><br />
He did not serve as a Minister under Boris Johnson, so carries no baggage from the outgoing Administration.<br /><br />
I worked with him as his Minister of State for Health, so know first-hand his integrity, diligence and determination to get difficult things done.<br /><br />
He had a successful career before entering Parliament with me in 2005, having set up from scratch and then running a tech business teaching English.<br /><br />
So he understands the importance of driving business investment to grow the economy, key to weathering the choppy economic waters ahead.<br /><br />
He is a strong campaigner, having successfully increased his majority against Liberal Democrats in Surrey for 20 years. But he knows that to win the next election he will need to create a team to retain and win seats from Labour in the Midlands and the North, and from the SNP in Scotland.<br /><br />
The country needs a serious leader for serious times. Jeremy Hunt has the integrity, competence and vision to restore the trust in our politics and to deliver the leadership as Prime Minister in which Conservatives can once again be proud.”</p></div>

              <h3>John Redwood (Wokingham)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Mr Sunak asks us &#8220;Do we confront this moment with honesty ,seriousness and determination, or do we tell ourselves comforting fairy tales that might make us feel better in the moment but leave our children worse off  tomorrow?&#8221;.</p>
<p>The briefing which accompanies his leadership offer tells us this is the man who will control public spending, reduce the deficit with tax rises and then get the economy growing again. He is the man who will not offer early tax cuts as these could fuel inflation.</p>
<p>So let us examine his presentation of his past and future economic management plans.</p>
<p>I am glad he now takes inflation seriously and is now determined to get it down. He is of course the man who approved and signed off the creation of £450 billion of new money during his brief period in office whilst claiming the Bank of England was independent. Indeed, so independent was the Bank that he was also required to sign off a complete indemnity on all the bonds the Bank bought with the new money, as they were bound to fall in value as soon  as interest rates went up. The truth is the main policies of printing money and keeping rates down for too long was the policy Mr Sunak endorsed and made possible, putting the full weight of the Treasury behind it. When I and others suggested the last £150bn of the printed money was too far and would be inflationary he disagreed with us. Most did  agree with the early offsets to the big damage the covid lockdown did but he continued them long past the recovery  which added to price rises.</p>
<p>I am glad he takes controlling public spending seriously. During lockdown he was the biggest spender as Chancellor we have ever had. Most of us agreed there did need to be substantial packages of support to families and businesses whose budgets were wrecked by enforced idleness to meet the health policy priorities. We did not agree with the lax approach to fraud and error in the disbursements. Nor did we see a lot of value for money in the  very expensive test and trace schemes he supported and financed. His campaign has not yet identified how he would now find ways of curtailing  spending which he did not find as Chief Secretary or Chancellor.</p>
<p>He used to tell us he was a low tax enthusiast but  he now tells us tax cuts are unrealistic. He put in place a 31% hike in the business tax rate. He put through an increase in employer and employee&#8217;s national insurance, breaking a Manifesto pledge and imposing a new tax on jobs. He put in a new social care tax and an on line shopping levy. He froze thresholds of Income tax driving many more people into higher tax bands. He left office as the Chancellor in a Conservative government who had imposed the highest ever tax burden on the UK. New promises of tax cuts delayed are difficult to believe.</p>
<p>He says he was a pro growth Chancellor, but after a good first year of recovery from covid the economy is  now badly slowed by his tax rises on top of the inflation damaging real incomes. It is difficult to see how his policies would suddenly rekindle UK growth when they are all based on Treasury austerity.</p>

<p>This week I travelled to Manchester, I still prefer Birmingham, to deliver a keynote speech at a conference on Looked After Children. They are children for whom the state has assumed responsibility because they can no longer live with their parent or parents. Nearly 500,000 children are in the care system at any one time and over 2,000 of them are Birmingham children.</p>



<p>I was speaking in my role as chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Looked After Children and Care Leavers. The event followed the publication of an independent review into the care system which its chair, Josh McAllister, called a once in a generation opportunity.</p>



<p>There have been many horror stories over the years. As a former social worker, I often feel some sympathy for overworked, overstretched and poorly managed staff although I’ve also questioned why it’s so easy for well-paid senior officers to flit from one good job to another while leaving a trail of questionable decisions behind them.</p>



<p>The review has some very clear themes. It argues for better support for families at a much earlier stage to reduce the number of breakdowns that result in children coming into care. It stresses that keeping children safe, both at home and in the care system, must be a priority. They are too many examples of the state failing those they take into care. McAllister wants more emphasis on supporting children’s relationships especially within their wider family but also with their informal, social networks. We don’t pay enough attention to children&#8217;s emotional needs and then wonder why they find it so hard to form good relationships in later life. Too often children are turned out of care situations at the age of 16 or 18 and left to fend for themselves.</p>



<p>This review has lots to commend it but we’re on our fifth children and families minister since I shadowed the job in 2015. The constant chopping and changing and failure to properly fund the system, McAllister wants £2Billion upfront for his family support plans, means we never really make the changes that matter. Birmingham youngsters deserve better.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP, Angus MacNeil has today spoken with SSEN’s Head of Corporate Affairs Transmission, Greg Clarke, to raise concerns about delays with the construction of the interconnector.&nbsp; This follows the publication of the ‘Pathway to 2030’ which confirms the requirement for a new 1.8GW HVDC link from the Western Isles.&nbsp; As a result, the 600MW cable has been overtaken by events.</p>



<p>SSEN has said that the link now required from a National Grid strategy paper will be a 1.8GW link.&nbsp; As a result, Ofgem will not sign off a 600MW cable when a 3 times bigger cable but at only twice the cost, has become the political wish to meet climate targets sufficient to accommodate all known onshore and offshore wind in and around the Western Isles. &nbsp;&nbsp;This will replace the previous proposals for a 600MW HVDC link.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SSEN have told Mr MacNeil that they will now explore opportunities to accelerate investment for this new link in advance of its current 2030 delivery date.</p>



<p>Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:</p>



<p>“I have spoken with SSEN who tell me that the link is going to be three times larger than was originally envisaged between Arnish and the mainland.&nbsp; The cable will be around 1.8GW of carrying capacity as opposed to 600MW and the cost will be about 1.2bn, although the cable is 3 times bigger, it is only double the cost.&nbsp; The downside is that it may well have a three-year delay.&nbsp; However, SSEN assure me that they are going to try to push this date back to get nearer to 2027 when it was originally envisaged to build the interconnector between Lewis and the mainland.</p>



<p>“This is all part of the UK Government’s reinforcement which is required to meet targets for 2030 and net zero in the National Grid’s support of ‘Pathway to 2030’.</p>



<p>“SSEN tell me that they are confident that Ofgem will approve this 1.8GW cable despite the difficulties earlier with the 600MW cable because the political situation and the case around this has changed.&nbsp; SSEN also tell me that if they went ahead with the 600MW cable for 2027, Ofgem simply wouldn’t sign it off now and it would be inevitably delayed.&nbsp; They feel that the best approach is to go with the 1.8GW, which is what the UK Government now suddenly want, and to try and push that forward using some of the work they have done in preparing for a 600MW cable.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, SSEN say there could be a delay with the cable, but it will be a far better product.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, on the connection charges which are excessively high to the North of Scotland (about 13 times what you would pay from the European Union into the UK grid) &nbsp;there is a working group in Ofgem looking at this and separately will continue to pursue this to help the case for energy production and not excessive charging hitting the North of Scotland.</p>



<p>&#8220;Finally, I would be happier if there wasn&#8217;t a further delay.”</p>

<div id="fb-root"></div>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has called for a workforce plan to address shortages in emergency care and across the whole NHS in a Westminster Hall debate on ambulance waiting times this week.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth referred to the shocking waiting times being experienced by people across the NHS.  The average response time for an ambulance call out for a stroke or suspected heart attack is 51 minutes 22 seconds, whilst the target is 18 minutes.  There are cases of people waiting in agony on the road for an ambulance for more than 5 hours, and last winter 89.8% more ambulances than the previous year experienced delays of 30 minutes or more.</p>
<p>At present, the Government has a total lack of plan to address workforce vacancies in social care.  Whilst there are such extreme staff shortages in the social care system, people who are medically fit enough to be discharged remain in hospital, taking up valuable bed space for new emergency arrivals who are left waiting in ambulances outside ER departments.  On a weekly basis, an average of 11,656 patients remained in hospital who no longer met the criteria to reside.</p>
<p>These pressures in hospitals discharging are directly impacting waiting times in emergency departments, putting staff under pressure and patients in danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: </strong></p>
<p>“Emergency department staff and paramedics show incredible courage and quick thinking on a daily basis.  They need more support from the Government, and a proper workforce plan that will address the staff shortages across the NHS and social care.</p>
<p>“Twelve years of austerity have led to an appalling state of affairs when it comes to waiting times in the health service, and the Government is not doing enough to address the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>“Discharges from hospitals must be improved, and our social care system must be fit for purpose before we can resolve the issues at the front of the hospital.  To do this we need to see a comprehensive workforce plan and social care plan from the Government. The Government’s so-called ‘fix’ for social care is not due to come until October 2023.  This is too late and not a fix at all.</p>
<p>“I will continue to press the Government to take action to alleviate pressures across the car system, from emergency departments to social care.  There is no quick fix, but if the Government is serious about improving waiting times they must look at the system as a whole.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/07/08/karin-smyth-mp-calls-for-a-workforce-plan-to-address-staff-shortages-across-the-nhs-and-improve-waiting-times/">Karin Smyth MP calls for a workforce plan to address staff shortages across the NHS and improve waiting times</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p>It’s always good to catch up with Brian and the team of ‘Back the Track’ volunteers. Last week I met up with them for a walk along the Mclean Way to see the great progress being made on the Track.</p>
<p>In particular, it was good to see the map of track walks and connections which the team have been working on and to see the aqueduct where bridge repairs are being undertaken.</p>
<p>The ‘Back the Track’ team of volunteers continue to do a fantastic job locally and it is good to see the Mclean Way being used and enjoyed by so many.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the walk and chat. Thank you.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Reacting to the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron said: "<em>Boris Johnson's lasting legacy as Prime Minister is that he has lowered the standards of public life so much that they are now in the sewer. But he didn't do it all on his own.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Day after day, Conservative MPs have defended and promoted Boris Johnson's serial dishonesty.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Conservative MPs stood by him when he mocked people in Cumbria and across the country when he broke the lockdown rules that he thought we should all abide by but that he felt he didn't need to.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Millions of people are struggling with the cost of living who desperately need the Government to help them and yet for the past seven months they've seen Conservative MPs spending all their time and energy on covering up scandals and throwing our politics into chaos.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"The British public will not forget the role that Conservative MPs have played in letting Boris Johnson get away with his dishonesty for so long.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"We would not accept this sort of behaviour for example from a head teacher, a business leader or a chair of parish council, yet Conservative MPs appear to be happy for him to stay on until Autumn. They are completely out of touch with what British people feel is right and decent."</em>

<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, commenting on the resignation of Boris Johnson said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This whole sorry saga is like nothing I have seen in my entire political career. We’ve had to put up with a dishonest, inept and arrogant Prime Minister, propped up by spineless Tory MPs. They’ve finally forced him to resign, but only after he had done lasting damage to our national institutions and inflicted chaos on the public in the middle of a cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, the Prime Minister needs to go immediately. Not in a couple of months, but right now. If the last few days have proven anything, it is that it would be profoundly reckless to leave the keys of Number 10 in the hands of Boris Johnson. He has disregarded convention and tradition, and in the process incapacitated entire Government departments.</p>
<p>He’s lost over a third of his Government, and it is not right for the Tories to inflict upon the country a lame duck Prime Minister who can’t even command the respect of his Cabinet, let alone the electorate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Labour Party have been clear. If the Tories do not have the guts to get rid of him, we will act in the national interest and force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I also want to be clear that removing one man will not remove the rot at the heart of the Conservative Party. The Tories have been in Government for 12 years, and in that time have unpicked our public services, left communities like mine in the lurch, and obliterated trust in politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a fresh start for Britain, and that simply can’t happen under the Tories. It’s time for a proper change of Government.</p></blockquote>

<p>On Monday afternoon, as vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Restorative Justice, I hosted the APPG Restorative Justice Evidence Session, together with Jim Simon, CEO of the Restorative Justice Council. We heard evidence from restorative justice projects within schools and healthcare sectors in England. Catherine Allard Headteacher of John Keble Primary School spoke about implementing restorative measures to change the culture in her school. Her school is in a very deprived, multicultural part of London. She said that choosing the staff leadership team was very important, and was essential so that children who are bullied or conduct the bullying are able to open up about their experiences and trust her staff. The support of parents and a multi-agency service was vital to the successful implementation of her project. The children go through the restorative script with staff and try and resolve the issues that are affecting their behaviour towards each other in school. Before restorative action was taken, there were many pupils excluded from school, but when Catherine became headteacher she was determined that her school would become inclusive. We heard from Simon Flowers, headteacher of Car Manor Community School, which has pupils from 4-19 years of age. Simon became headteacher in 2005 and grew up in the locality. When he took over, the school was a third full, with children with very complex needs. He decided to never permanently exclude a pupil and the values in school would be relationship led. He now has 700 children who meet in coaching groups of 8-10 pupils, of mixed age and gender. They meet every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, for 45 minutes, and sit in a circle to discuss the issues that are effecting them. Staff have coaching groups too. The groups self-regulate and make positive choices to improve their behaviour. The older pupils guide the younger to change their mindset to be tolerant and kind towards each other. It’s a family culture. The aim is to produce happy, mature, well-rounded children who progress to colleges or jobs. Feedback shows that this is being achieved. Now his school is oversubscribed and 35 of the 100 staff are alumni. Staff and pupil absences are very low.</p>
<p>We heard from Janine Carroll of Resolve, and Dan Reisel from University College London (UCL) who teamed up to implement restorative practices in maternity care. Janine is a training provider, and Dan works in maternity in the Royal Free Hospital and researches at UCL. Janine looked at relationships in a healthcare setting, and it’s about patients and workers being heard, empowered, and their needs met. Dan looked at the blame culture that has developed when maternity care goes wrong, and changing this to resolve patient and staff traumatic experiences, rather than litigate.</p>
<p>Our final witness was from the social care sector, Rebecca Rushton, who has worked in restorative justice in the childcare and families department for Torbay Council since February 2021. Rebecca comes from a criminal justice background where she implemented restorative practice into many sectors of the justice sector. Rebecca’s role is to embed the golden thread of restorative practice throughout the department. All new staff are trained in restorative practice, and partner organisations are trained too. Ofstead has produced a good report, and Rebecca hopes to continue restorative practice throughout all council departments with the assistance of the Chief Executive and councillors who have been very supportive.</p>
<p>The business in the chamber was Second Reading of the High Speed Rail (Crewe to Manchester) Bill and Labour abstained on the division.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I chaired the Online Safety Bill Committee all day, when we continued line by line scrutiny and debated many more amendments which were tabled by the UK Government and Labour and SNP opposition parties.</p>
<p>The business in the chamber was the Official Opposition Day debates. The first debate was “Access to GP Services and NHS Dentists”. The second debate was “Replacing the Prime Minister’s Ethics Adviser (Cabinet Office)”. Lord Geidt resigned unexpectedly on Wednesday 15th June in a letter to the PM, in which he said that he had been asked to consider “measures which risk a deliberate and purposeful breech of the Ministerial Code” and he could not have any part in an action that would make a mockery of the Code. Labour’s Motion would amend the Standing Orders to say that if the Independent Adviser post is vacant for more than two months, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) can appoint its own independent adviser on Ministerial Code breeches and begin its own investigation. Labour pressed a vote at the end of the debate at 6.47pm, which we lost by 161 to 252 votes.</p>
<p>The business in the chamber on Wednesday was Northern Ireland Oral Questions followed by PMQs and the Social Security (Additional Payments) Bill All Stages. The Chancellor announced his Cost of Living Package on 26th May, and this included: £650 cost of living payments, payable in two instalments to people in receipt of means-tested benefits such as Universal Credit; and a £150 Disability cost of living payment for those receiving non-means-tested disability benefits such as PIP. The UK Government recently changed the rules on the Warm Homes Discount (WHD) scheme so that those on DLA, PIP and AA are no longer eligible. For people on PIP this means that the UK Government are giving the £150 back to them that was taken off due to changes in the WHD scheme.</p>
<p>There was a deferred division on the Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2022 SI 2022 No 554, which was voted through by 215 to 70 votes.</p>
<p>APPG Sport, of which I am chair, held an online event during National School Sports Week 2022 to discuss the future of maximising PE and sport in schools for the benefit of children and young people in England. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, vice chair of our APPG, and Honorary Life Ambassador for Youth Sport Trust was on the call. Over 50 sports stakeholders joined in the call to listen to guest speakers: Ali Oliver MBE, Chief Executive of Youth Sports Trust; Stephanie Hilborne, Chief Executive Women in Sport; Ashlea Smith, Head of Children, Young People and Families, UKactive; and Leigh Thompson, Head of Policy, Sport and Recreation Alliance. There was a lively session of questions from the stakeholders to the panellists, which culminated in agreement that sport is so important to the physical and mental health of children of all ages, and school sport is vital in this development.</p>
<p>On Monday 27th June I chaired the Petitions Debate in Westminster Hall “That this House has considered E-petition 597715 relating to the school week”, which was opened by the chair of the Petitions Committee, Catherine McKinnell MP. The petition “required to make Friday part of the school weekend, require schools to make Friday a day off, meaning there will be three days that children will get to stay off every week. Children can have a lot of stress at school due to exams and homework and with a 3 day weekend, children could have a longer time to relax and let off stress gained from school.”</p>
<p>The UK Government response provided on 21st April 2022, stated that it has no plans to require schools to make Friday part of the weekend and that regular attendance at school is vital for children’s education, well-being and long-term development.</p>
<p>I was honoured to listen to Reverend Professor D. Ben Rees speak about his fascinating book about Jim Griffiths, the former MP for Llanelli, titled “Jim: the life and work of Rt Hon James Griffiths”. The evening was opened by Lord John Morris, whose time as the former MP for Aberavon overlapped with Jim and he shared his memories of the great man. Jim was Minister for National Insurance in the 1945 Labour Government and founded the modern welfare state. Jim persuaded the then Labour Leader Hugh Gaitskill to build relationships towards Welsh devolution and Jim was known as the “architect of devolution”. The event was hosted by the current MP for Llanelli, Dame Nia Griffith.</p>
<p>On Monday evening at 10pm Labour voted against the Second Reading of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill which had been debated for six hours in the chamber. The Bill was introduced on 13th June and is in response to the UK Government’s concerns over the Protocol (special arrangements for Northern Ireland so it is border free) and not being able to negotiate a settlement with the EU. The Bill empowers Ministers to dis-apply the Protocol and relevant parts of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement in domestic law, and make new domestic law in place of the Protocol. Ministers would do this for safeguarding, social and economic stability, the territorial or constitutional integrity of the UK, functioning of the Belfast Agreement, health, and environmental reasons. There are 5 areas where Ministers can act: movement of goods; regulations of goods; vat and excise; removing the jurisdiction of the CJEU; and state aid. The only parts protected would be individual rights, the common travel area, and North-South co-operation. The EU has said that if the Bill is passed then it will respond with all measures at its disposal. The European Commission has said that it will move ahead with legal action against the UK. Labour lost the vote by 221 to 295 votes.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I continued to chair the Online Safety Bill line by line scrutiny sessions. The hundreds of amendments were debated to conclusion last week, and this week we are considering new clauses to be added to the Bill.</p>
<p>In the evening I went to the world premier of the documentary about trophy hunting “Lions, Bones and Bullets” which told the heart-breaking story of trophy hunting captive-bred lions and its links to the Far Eastern lion bone trade. The authors were present, and told us about how they bravely went undercover in South Africa to infiltrate ranches that specifically breed lions who are then shot by trophy hunters whilst in a captive situation. The lion cubs are taken from their mothers when only a few weeks old, and are kept in small open air pens, with no shelter from the sun, and fed with cattle carcasses from abattoirs, which may be diseased. The bones from the killed lions are then sold to countries in the Far East, and are fraudulently used as tiger bones in Chinese medicine. The documentary will be released in the autumn.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning I joined in a Zoom call with fellow officers of the APPG for Steel to discuss plans to keep pressure on the UK Government to support the UK steel sector.</p>
<p>The business in the Chamber began with Oral Questions to the Secretary of State for Scotland, followed by PMQs. The Prime Minister was at the NATO summit so Deputy Dominic Raab stood in, and by convention the Labour Deputy Angela Rayner opposed him across the despatch box.</p>
<p>After PMQs I attended a special event during Cecil Week, the anniversary of the killing of Cecil the Lion, and the launch of the new report of a UK ban on trophies, “Trophy Hunting and Britain: The case for a Ban”. Guest speakers were Rt Hon George Eustice MP, Secretary of State for DEFRA; Dr Jane Goodhall DBE; Founder of the Jane Goodhall Institute; HE SKI Khama, President of Botswana (2008-2018); Boniface Mpario, Senior Maasai Elder. The event was chaired by Eduardo Gonclaves, Founder of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, “For People, For Wildlife, For Ever”. The 117,000 word APPG report is the world’s most comprehensive about trophy hunting, and includes facts, figures plus case studies and testimonies of world experts. There were over 200,000 lions in the 1970s but there could be as few as 9,610 lions left in the world today. Trophy hunters shoot an animal every 3 minutes, and could kill up to 170 million this century. British trophy hunters have won prizes for single-handedly shooting over 100 different wild animals. Opinion polls show that 9 out of 10 British voters, conservationists, scientists, and African community groups back a ban.</p>
<p>The regulators – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) and the Financial Services Complaints Service (FSCS) – addressed MPs who have constituents that work, or have worked, for British Steel and have been affected by unsuitable advice provided by financial advisers regarding the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS). The regulators discussed the proposed BSPS compensation redress scheme which is out to consultation. MPs fed back their concerns to the regulators, and we have collected our views in a letter written to the FCA, signed by 27 cross-party MPs.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening I attended another world premier documentary “Land of the Free: Out of the Shadows” about how trophy hunting is thwarting efforts to protect endangered wildlife. There are many celebrities who have been campaigning against trophy hunting for many years, and some took part in the film, for example Virginia McKenna of Born Free, Priscilla Presley, Peter Egan.</p>
<p>There were votes from 7pm on the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill at Committee Stage which was debated on the floor of the House. Labour voted against incorporation of Government New Clauses 18-25, losing by 273 to 205 votes. Labour voted amendment our 98 and lost by 175 to 271 votes. Labour voted for amendment 97 and lost by 191 to 271 votes.</p>

<p>West Dunbartonshire’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes is pushing for action to tackle the problem of persistent flooding which has been impacting households in Linnvale</p>
<p>The local SNP MP met with frustrated residents earlier this year at his advice surgery to hear their concerns about access issues and damage to property during periods of heavy rain.<span id="more-1821145"></span></p>
<p>Senior officials at Scottish Water were asked by the area’s MP to carry out investigations and put in place a plan to reduce the risk of flooding for residents in and around Livingstone Street.</p>
<p>The public water company has faced criticised for stating Linnvale is not a priority area for investment, after assessments by engineers revealed the local sewer system has insufficient capacity.</p>
<p>MP Docherty-Hughes is now stepping up efforts to press the water authority to act. He is consulting with local residents to demonstrate the extent of the adverse impact flooding has had in Linnvale over the years.</p>
<p>A letter and survey has been issued to more than 150 households in Linnvale, with residents asked to complete a questionnaire about their experiences of flooding difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Residents in Linnvale have been adversely affected by flooding problems for too long now.</p>
<p>&#8220;During heavy rainfall, flood water is impacting dozens of properties and causing access difficulties for Linnvale households. Given repeated localised flooding in close proximity to the school, and disruption to vulnerable residents, I am pressing Scottish Water to prioritise the investment needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to the residents who have already been in touch. I hope to demonstrate the extent of these flooding problems, and would encourage everyone who has received a survey from my office to complete it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Localised flooding is a long-standing issue in Linnvale. The more people who speak up, the better the chance of getting this resolved.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>Any Linnvale residents who would like a copy of Martin’s survey are asked to contact his constituency office on <a href="mailto:martin.docherty.mp@parliament.uk">martin.docherty.mp@parliament.uk</a> or 0141 952 2988.</em></strong></p>

<p>When asked to list the benefits of being in the UK Union, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross was left scrambling for answers. He landed on the UK&#8217;s covid response and vaccine deployment when pressed. This, it seemed, was his best reason for us all to stay shackled in a broken political union. He is on shaky ground if this is going to be his approach.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe title="Case for the UK Union: Law-Breaking, Lies &amp; Cronyism" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlDhtpUmE9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Without a doubt, the UK was quick off the mark with vaccines, and the UK Government played its part in that prompt response. A reaction that was possible in no small part due to the incredible work undertaken by the scientific community, particularly those who worked on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, along with Swedish partners.</p>



<h4 class="has-text-align-center">But, of course, that is only part of the story:</h4>



<p>Few of us will ever forget the Prime Minister&#8217;s own response to the initial surge in COVID cases. &#8220;let the bodies pile high&#8221; was his well-reported choice of words. Hardly the comfort people needed when their lives were at risk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Then came the lockdown-breaking parties that ended in UK lawmakers becoming lawbreakers.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When people needed to trust their Government most, they were treated to falsehoods repeatedly by the Prime Minister. His lies were perpetrated amid the worst health pandemic in living history – not something people can easily forget.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister and his Government asserted without any basis that they could only vaccinate the public because of Brexit. They claimed the big bad European Medicines Agency would have stopped them. It is still repeated, and it is still a whopper. Yet, back then, the UK was still transitioning from the EU and still subject to EU laws. The UK&#8217;s former&nbsp; Vaccine Task Force Head, Kate Bingham, said of the claims, &#8220;Any other country could have registered the vaccine under EU law -so that was nothing to do with Brexit.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The tories didn&#8217;t spin this line because they believed it to be true; they did it because it fitted their Brexit propaganda campaign.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It really does speak for itself that Ross thinks the UK response to a crisis that has left the public trust in tatters is his strongest defence of the union.</p>



<p>Douglas Ross also claimed that research indicated that if it were not part of the UK political union, Scotland would have missed out on over a million vaccinations. It is quite a statement to make, given the impact damaging public trust had on the vaccination programme.</p>



<p>It also begs the question of how several small independent countries have successfully vaccinated their populations – and what would have made Scotland different?</p>



<p>Malta, for instance, has vaccinated more people per 100 of the population than the UK. In fact, CNN has an excellent vaccine tracker showing the UK behind many nations, including independent countries of Cuba, Singapore, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, and Finland. Some are in the EU, and some are not, but all have delivered more arms shots by their populations&#8217; measures.</p>



<p>So, again, why would Scotland be the only small independent country that wouldn&#8217;t have been able to vaccinate its population?</p>



<p>Ross and his colleagues love to talk up the &#8220;broad shoulders&#8221; of UK Government financial support. It&#8217;s as if no other country, large or small, took action to protect its citizen&#8217;s livelihoods.</p>



<p>During lockdown in 2020, Columbia University looked at the support nations were giving to their people. It is striking that, again, independent Malta was at the top of the list, providing 25% of GDP to its people, compared to the UK&#8217;s 5%. The UK came 47<sup>th</sup> by the measures used. Factoring in banking support pushed it up the rankings, but much of that funding never reached the people who needed it. In France, 100% of wages were paid to those on low pay, and in the Netherlands, 90%.</p>



<p>Every Government with fiscal control has the power to help the people they serve.</p>



<p>It never adds up, as to why Ross and his colleagues believe Scotland would be the only country not able to do this.</p>



<p>While on fiscal responsibility, remember the dodgy procurement processes, the cronyism, and the wasted millions spent by awarding contracts to their buddies. There was the damning report by the Westminster committee on the PPE procurement shambles and the 10s of billions of pounds wasted on test and trace measures never used or the &#8220;eye watering sums spent on overpriced consultants.&#8221;</p>



<p>Douglas Ross may want to wear his rose-tinted glasses when looking at the UK&#8217;s response to the pandemic, but the rest of us live in reality.</p>



<p>That he thinks these are his strongest arguments for the UK union says a lot about the lack of benefits of this outdated political union. If this is their best reason to stay, roll on the day when we have the power to build a fairer, more prosperous Scotland.</p>

			<p>The deaths of vulnerable disabled social security claimants are, in my view, a damning indictment on successive Governments.</p>
<p>If the key purpose of all Governments is to keep its citizens safe, one has to ask why have they failed so miserably to protect some of the most vulnerable citizens in the UK?</p>
<p>We know that these deaths are happening: between July 2019 and March 2022 official data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that they have investigated 123 deaths and 34 cases of serious harm through their so-called Internal Process Review.</p>
<p>But the <em>actual</em> scale of deaths is believed to be much more, and the <em>causes</em> of these deaths has yet to be investigated.</p>
<p>There are glimpses that we are seeing just the tip of the iceberg from these official figures: former MP Madeleine Moon’s written question to the DWP revealing that 60 people a month who are refused Personal Independence Payment die within 3 months; another found that 274 people die each month after being found fit for work within 6 months; the National Audit Office’s report on claimant suicides in 2020; Professor Ben Barr’s academic report on 600 suicides being associated with the Work Capability Assessment between 2010 and 2013; the BBC’s Alex Homer’s investigation and more. Now this report, Death by Welfare, which looks at the impact of successive welfare reform on these deaths adds to this and compliments the two reports on the impacts of the 2016 Welfare Reform Act on the health of children and disabled people published by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Health in All Policies.</p>
<p>The serial obfuscation and even cover up by this Government has made this worse. The refusal to allow the Work and Pensions Select Committee &#8211; whose job is to hold the Government to account on social security issues &#8211; to see the reports into these deaths. ‘Destroying’ peer review reports (the IPR predecessor) before 2016. The failure to give these peer review reports into social security deaths to the reviewers of the Work Capability Assessment ‘because they didn’t ask for them’! See my Urgent Questions on this in 2019.</p>
<p>I don’t want any more families like Pip Day’s, Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s, David Clapson’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have. The current Work and Pensions Secretary has even said she doesn’t have a duty of care to safeguard vulnerable claimants, and for me that says it all. This social security system needs a root and branch reform.</p>
<p>I’ve been calling for a public inquiry to investigate the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date. Despite all of this, the Government has refused to listen. Help us get justice for them. Add your voice to the call for a public inquiry.</p>

I was born in 1981 and spent my childhood in America. So I grew up just as Margaret Thatcher’s special relationship with Ronald Reagan was blossoming.

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my June email newsletter. Opening with the marvellous Platinum Jubilee celebrations and closing with some of the largest rail strikes in a generation, this has once again been an eventful month for Amber Valley. And as the country and our locality faces many challenges as we move forward, I want to better understand your thoughts and feelings about the most pressing of these issues. To this end, my Annual Residents Survey is now live and can be found below.</p>



<p>You will also find updates on: the ongoing bid for ownership of Derby County Football Club, the local rollout of the £150 energy payment to help people with their bills, this month’s rail strikes, my work as chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Pensions, and NHS waiting times in our constituency.</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Residents&#8217; Summer Survey</u></strong></p>



<p>I am pleased to announce that this year’s Amber Valley Summer Survey is now live. This is where you can express how you feel about the most important issues facing our constituency and nation.</p>



<p>The survey takes around 5 minutes to complete and is immensely useful for me to understand your thoughts on present day issues. Surveys like this one help inform my decisions on how best to represent you in parliament, how to vote on important legislation, and what local issues I should focus on within the constituency.</p>



<p>We have had fantastic results from our previous surveys so I am hoping the residents of Amber Valley can outdo themselves once again. You can find the survey using the link below:</p>

<p><strong><u>Derby County Football Club</u></strong></p>



<p>I am happy to update constituents that Derby County Football Club looks set to exit administration soon. As many of you will already know, Clowes Developments LTD have this month acquired Pride Park stadium and have submitted a formal bid for ownership of the club. This is truly excellent news as the acquisition of Pride Park stadium has been a significant challenge in relation to the sale of the club.</p>



<p>If someone had told me 30 years ago, when I watched Notts County cruelly deprived of a championship play-off place, that I would have some role to play in trying to save Derby County, I might have expressed some doubt. But it is at this sort of time that the football family comes together. The only reason we have rivalries is because our rivals stay in existence; no one wants to see any club go out of business, least of all a club with the size and history of Derby County.</p>



<p>Alongside a number of other local MPs from across the political spectrum, I have been engaging with stakeholders, the club’s joint administrators Quantuma, and the EFL on a regular basis. I have also attended a number of debates in Westminster on this matter, and at times the club’s future has seemed uncertain. I am therefore, especially pleased that a deal has been reached, and the future of the club looks more assured.</p>



<p><strong><u>The local rollout of the £150 Council Tax rebate</u></strong></p>



<p>Last month, I welcomed the Government’s announcement of further measures to help households with the rising cost of living and higher levels of inflation; caused largely by the fallout from the pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine. As part of this support, the Government pledged to give households in council tax bands A to D a £150 energy payment through a council tax rebate.</p>



<p>The council tax rebate is being rolled out by local authorities, and households in Amber Valley who pay their council tax by direct debit will have already received the £150 payment directly into their bank accounts, a number of weeks ago. However, as many of you will be aware, the payment to those in Amber Valley who do not have a direct debit set up with the council was delayed by a number of weeks.</p>



<p>The explanation Amber Valley Borough Council (AVBC) gave for the delay was that the council had to acquire new software so that bank accounts for those not on direct debit could be validated to prevent fraudulent claims. On the &nbsp;22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;June I spoke about the local ramifications of this delay in the House of Commons, and throughout the month I have been engaging with AVBC and colleagues in Westminster in an attempt to expedite the rollout of this support.</p>



<p>I am happy to update residents that the application form for the £150 energy rebate for those who do not pay by direct debit, is now live. You can find the form online&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/benefits/150-energy-bills-rebate-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></p>



<p>Alternatively, if you are not able to access the website or do not feel confident to complete the form online then AVBC’s Customer Services are available to assist you. Please use the following number: 01773 570222. You are also able to go directly to the council building in Ripley with your Council tax bill and bank account details to complete the process in person.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Platinum Jubilee celebrations</u></strong></p>



<p>It was wonderful to see so many of you turn out to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations at the beginning of this month. Amber Valley put on a fantastic show for the occasion, with events held across the constituency. I know many of you will have attended the tea parties, lighting of beacons, and late-night festivities that make occasions like this so special.</p>



<p>It was an occasion to take pride and give our thanks to The Queen for her exemplary service over the past 70 years. All of it dedicated to the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.</p>



<p>We have been extremely lucky to have The Queen as our head of state for so long, bringing stability through a time of tremendous change.</p>



<p><strong><u>NHS waiting lists&nbsp;</u></strong></p>



<p>The Government is making good progress in reducing the number of NHS patients waiting the longest for treatment. At the national level, the number of patients who have waited over 2 years to receive treatment has fallen from 22,500 in January to 6,700. I completely support the Government’s efforts, and have been in regular contact with our local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to assess the scale of the challenge and the progress that is being made.</p>



<p>The pandemic had a tremendous impact on patient waiting times across our area, but thanks to the inspiring efforts of NHS staff and increased financial support from the Government, the backlog is now being reduced. In Derbyshire, the first week of January 2022 saw a total of 454 people who were registered as waiting longer than 2 years for treatment. However, as of 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June there were only 161 patients waiting longer than 104 weeks for treatment.</p>



<p>Derby and Derbyshire CCG have told me in recent days that they are making good progress towards their target of ensuring no patient will be waiting more than two years for treatment by the end of this month. I will continue to engage with the local CCG as well as my colleagues in Westminster as we continue to work towards improving patient outcomes and reducing backlogs and waiting times. I hope to be able to update residents with more good news that shows we’re heading in the right direction soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Rail strikes</u></strong></p>



<p>I know many of you were affected by travel disruption this month as the rail unions organised a week of strikes designed to bring large parts of the country’s rail network to a halt. Strike action took place on Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup>, Thursday 23<sup>rd</sup>, and Saturday 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June, however, due to the way the unions organised the strikes, we witnessed significant knock-on-delays and cancellations on all the remaining days of that week.</p>



<p>In Amber Valley, the strikes affected services from all our rail stations &#8211; Ambergate, Langley Mill, and Alfreton. With CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, and Northern services suffering major disruption and issuing statements warning customers to only travel if absolutely necessary.</p>



<p>My view is that these strikes are wrong. The unions have harmed countless individuals up and down the county &#8211; preventing scheduled NHS operations and treatment, disrupting students’ GCSE exams, and preventing people from attending important personal events like weddings and funerals. This is all in addition to forcing ordinary people to pay more to get into and out of work, if they can get into work at all – hitting millions of families in the pocket.</p>



<p>I do not believe it is fair to single out already well-paid rail workers for a substantial pay increase over and above the rest of the workforce in both the public and private sectors at this time of high global inflation. Especially when these pay increases to rail staff would have to come from either higher rail ticket prices, or the taxpayer. For the sake of ordinary working families, I hope a sensible resolution to this dispute can be found soon.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Labour frontbench continue to refuse to condemn these strikes. With a number of Labour MPs actually attending picket lines, adding to the disruption. I believe it is relevant to include here that the RMT union, who organised these strikes, have donated almost £250,000 to the Labour Party and local branches in the last decade. And five Labour MPs who have supported the strikes have received a total of £20,000 in donations from the RMT union.</p>



<p><strong><u>Pensions dashboard: a revolution in how we plan for retirement</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June, as part of my role as chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Pensions, I hosted the group’s Annual General Meeting alongside a discussion on the future of pensions dashboards. These dashboards could revolutionise how we plan for retirement and interact with our pensions.</p>



<p>Pensions dashboards will enable people to access all of their pensions information easily, securely, in one place online. Dashboards will provide clear and simple information about all the pensions a person has accumulated over their lifetime, including any workplace pensions and their State Pension. The aim is to create an information board where people can easily see the combined value of all their pensions, as well as a host of other personal pensions information, all in one place. Enabling better, more informed, retirement planning.</p>



<p>At the meeting we discussed concerns people might have regarding pensions dashboards, and I was reassured to learn of the privacy, security, and personalisation being built into these systems. For example, these systems will not allow anyone to move or interfere with their pensions accidently or deliberately in any way, they are simply designed to display an individual’s pensions information so they can better understand how much pension savings they have, and where is currently kept.</p>



<p>The Government has committed to work with the pensions industry to develop these dashboards, a move which I wholeheartedly welcome. I will continue engaging with the pensions industry and my ministerial colleagues on this matter as these pensions dashboards become available.</p>



<p><strong>Street Watch &#8211; report it:</strong></p>



<p>As always, if there are any street repairs in your area, such as potholes, pavement repairs or broken street lights, you can report these issues and concerns to me quickly and easily&nbsp;<a href="https://nigelmillsmp.com/amber-valley-street-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;so I can ask for the repairs to be investigated and addressed.</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>This morning we were notified by government that they are minded to appoint 
commissioners to oversee some parts of the City Council. The appointment of 
commissioners would be unjustified, and an attack on our local democracy. Under 
new leadership, Nottingham Labour have been making progress, being open about 
the difficulties we face and working hard to put things right. We have worked with the 
government appointed Improvement and Assurance Board to address all their 
concerns and they have reported positively to Government about our progress.</p>



<p>This work has resulted in the reduction in council debt, a transformation plan that will 
save the council £45m and improve services for Nottingham people. We have set a 
four year balanced budget, and have changed the culture and governance so that 
issues like the HRA are uncovered, shared transparently and sorted. The Council 
under the current leadership has made significant changes to the way it works, is 
open about the issues we face and is determined to get things right and this has 
been recognised by the Improvement and Assurance Board.</p>



<p>The Improvement and Assurance Board, headed by Sir Tony Redmond &#8211; the former 
Local Government Ombudsman &#8211; have described our progress positively to 
government and reported on our determination to succeed, so we are asking 
government what additional change they expect to achieve by bringing in people 
who know nothing of the City and our residents’ needs. Although we oppose the 
Governments’ intention to appoint commissioners the continuity provided by Sir Tony 
Redmond provides some assurance that our previous improvements are understood 
and can be built on.</p>



<p>But, we are asking what new actions would happen as a result of 
commissioners coming in that would improve the working of this council, or 
result in any changes that Nottingham people would want. We will use our 
opportunity to respond to this proposal from Government to ask these 
questions.</p>



<p>If it is the case that the government does take this action, this will be based 
not on what is best for the city, but what is best for the Conservative Party.</p>



<p>We will of course work positively and openly with commissioners, as we have with 
the Improvement and Assurance Board in the best interests of our city, but we will be 
straight with them, and straight with Nottingham people and will continue to fight for 
what Nottingham people need and have elected a Labour council to do.</p>



<p>The government cuts to our budgets means that it is more difficult to do everything 
we want to do to help our communities at this time but we have been fighting for 
Nottingham and protecting our services against the worst effects of Tory cuts. We 
made sure that Nottingham City Council &#8211; and our amazing staff &#8211; were there for you 
during the Covid crisis and we fought hard to get what we needed for our city to help 
keep people safe.</p>



<p>After more than a decade of Tory austerity &#8211; and the pandemic &#8211; we have managed  to set a four year balanced budget. This has not been easy, but Nottingham Labour:                                                                     Has retained 75 community protection officers                                                                                                     Are still building council houses and have improved private rented housing  through our licensing scheme                                                                                                                                                                        Has kept ownership of our outstanding care homes                                                                                                    Is still running six leisure centres                                                                                                                                 Is supporting Welfare Rights advice services across the city because we  defend what is needed by Nottingham people.</p>



<p>We are still supporting free events for families all year round, and you can still expect 
a regular bus service to get you there from our award winning city owned bus 
company. We have our own bus company because Labour protected it, when many 
others were sold off to private operators and they are now seeing more cancelled 
services and far higher fares. We invested in a tram that brings good jobs to the city 
and gets people to them. Our great public transport system has contributed to 
cleaner air than other cities in the UK and made people less reliant on a car.</p>



<p>The transformation of the Broadmarsh is underway after the shopping centre 
operator went into administration, a new central library will soon be fitted out, a green 
space in the heart of our city will be created and new developments creating jobs 
and homes will be coming in the next few years.</p>



<p>We are a city of hardworking people and Nottingham deserves better than 
intervention from an out of touch Tory government that is more concerned with 
protecting the profits of the energy companies than the people who can’t heat their 
homes or struggle to feed their families. We understand what twelve years of Tory 
austerity and now the cost of living crisis means to you, because we do not just 
represent our communities, we are part of them. We will carry on fighting for what 
Nottingham needs and will still be ready to help with the problems you are facing, or 
hear your views and hopes for the city.</p>

<p>The moment it was announced that Bradford had won the City of Culture 2025 title is a moment I will never forget. The crowds gathered in City Park erupted in cheers and applause at the sheer joy and immense pride of winning the title. I have said it many times in the past three weeks but it deserves to be said again: Congratulations Bradford!</p>



<p>And while we are sure to enjoy all sorts of exciting cultural events across Bradford District during our year with the crown, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The City of Culture title is not just twelve months for Bradford to shine in the national limelight. It is a transformative opportunity for the city to unlock its potential and make sure Bradford’s light keeps burning brightly for years to come.</p>



<p>Previous title winners have seen tens of millions of pounds of long-term investment – and there is no reason why Bradford can’t do better. Bradford is the youngest, most entrepreneurial city in the country and study after study has shown it is the city with most to gain from levelling up and investment. Our City of Culture win is an unmissable opportunity to leverage investment, funding and ideas into the city. It is about raising Bradford’s profile and making the case that we are open for business. It is a chance to showcase Bradford businesses to the world and to show that if you’re a company, then Bradford is a thriving place to come and do businesses too.</p>



<p>But to make the most of this springboard opportunity, families and businesses need support with the day-to-day struggle of making ends meet right now. I know times continue to be hard today but, what is worse, is that the country is on track to face an even harsher energy and cost of living crisis this winter.</p>



<p>In January, Labour proposed a one-off windfall tax on North Sea oil and other gas producers who are raking in obscene profits while ordinary people struggle, as a way to fund help with soaring energy costs. It took five months for the Government to finally accept that this was the right thing to do.</p>



<p>From January to May, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak left families, older people and those already pushed to breaking point worried, panicking and stuck because the Government failed to act.</p>



<p>I have long been calling on the Government to take action. In September 2021, I raised my concerns regarding our dwindling natural gas reserves directly with the Business Secretary and challenged the Government’s decision to stop investing in gas storage. I was met with meaningless rhetoric about future energy diversification and no plan – right before an energy crisis caused by a surge in wholesale gas prices. Then in May this year, we heard how the UK had a huge surplus of gas &#8211; but that we had nowhere to store it, while announcements were made that as many as six million households could face power cuts because of gas shortages.</p>



<p>And it’s not just people here that are being hit by the cost of energy; it is affecting local businesses too. Some are facing astronomical energy bills as the energy price cap does not apply to businesses. I visited one energy-intensive manufacturer recently who told me their energy bills have skyrocketed from £7 million to £35 million a year. When I asked the Business and Energy Minister what plans the Government had to support businesses like this, the Minister simply dismissed this as an ‘extreme case’ – yet I am hearing that this is the story up and down the country. The government needs to listen to businesses and step in to help them.</p>



<p>This is important. Bradford’s manufacturing industry is part of the city’s heritage. Over 24,000 people in the city work in manufacturing, making it the fourth biggest city for manufacturing in the country. Energy intensive industries across the UK like steel, food production, basic chemicals and building materials are essential to our everyday lives. Hardworking workers plough in hour after hour to keep these industries going. How can we expect to be able to showcase the best of Bradford when rising energy costs means businesses and residents alike are fighting to keep their heads above the water?</p>



<p>To make the most of its City of Culture win, Bradford needs its residents and businesses to be thriving. We need the national Government to get the basics right on this: Act now to properly support businesses, not six months down the line when it reaches another crisis point.</p>



<p>Bradford is ready to build a City of Culture legacy that will last for decades to come, and I call for the Government to get on board with us too.</p>

<p>After a three year covid related absence the Hannington Country Fair returned this last weekend, with huge crowds arriving in this tiny Hampshire village. With it&#8217;s usual one way system in place, the fair was a lovely way to spend an afternoon with the kids, and see some old friends. I even released a dove in support of the local hospice!</p>

<p>I am writing with a further update on a couple of local matters.</p>
<p>Firstly can I start by thanking everyone who was involved in organising all the Platinum Jubilee Events locally. We had a really wide range of things going on over the weekend, and I know it all took a huge amount of effort. Thank you.</p>
<h2>TFL Clean Air Consultation</h2>
<p>Those who live at the north end of Epsom and Ewell and in Nork are probably particularly aware of the Mayor of London’s plans to extend the Ultra Low Emission zone to the London boundary. This would mean that older vehicles would have to pay a daily charge to drive across the boundary.</p>
<p>Clearly this has major implications for many people living locally, and while I understand the intent behind the policy, it is in my view damaging and unworkable for the areas immediately adjoining the boundary. Transport for London have yet to give clear details about how it would work on the border – for example what do they plan to do with cases like that of Sparrow Farm Road in Stoneleigh,  which is in Surrey on one side and in London on the other. But it would mean a charge for many Surrey residents doing local journeys or driving from one place in Surrey to another if the route crossed the boundary.</p>
<p>I have lodged an objection to the scheme because of this, and would encourage residents here to make their views known to TfL before the consultation ends. You can do so via this link</p>
<p><a href="https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/cleanair">https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/cleanair</a></p>
<p>Please do take part.</p>
<h2>Supporting Ukraine</h2>
<p>Thank you also to all of those who are helping Ukrainian refugees locally.</p>
<p>Over 70 Ukrainian families have arrived in the area and are being hosted by sponsor families.    If you are hosting and need some help, please reach out to Epsom &amp; Ewell Refugee Network who can offer support and advise to you and your guests.   They have a help desk each Monday at the Surrey Stands with Ukraine unit in the Ashley Centre 0930 &#8211; 1430.</p>
<p>The Network are holding a free Summer Language School to offer intensive English classes to refugees over the summer holidays.  If you want more information, you can find out more on their website (see link below).</p>

<p>If you are a teacher and can offer any help over the summer, please get in touch with them at <a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com">epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Many Ukrainians are now finding work and looking to rent a property.   If you are a local landlord and want to find out more about renting your property to a Ukrainian family, please get in touch with Epsom &amp; Ewell Refugee Network to find out more about how all of this works and how your rent is paid.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hub in the Ashley Centre continues to collect supplies to send to Ukraine, including tins of food for areas where supplies are short. I know that they would welcome any extra support.</p>

<p>Google Classroom is a good idea. It&#8217;s going to help teachers create better lessons, keep students engaged and reach out to parents more. The real question is whether it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom</h2>



<p>The availability of free education is a gift, but only if it can come with high quality. Google Classroom has given students in classrooms around the country an online option to supplement their learning. A potential downside to these options is the inability to meet with professors and apply classroom learning. As a part of the University of Washington system, we have found the use of Google Classroom during the quarter distance courses produced good results for both parties. Distance learning is here to stay and has only grown over time. If you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t left behind in a digital world, you may want to consider your options and how they will help or hurt your future professional prospects.</p>



<p>Google Classroom is a reliable one-stop-shop for managing all of your coursework and communication. It is definitely worth checking out if you are in a distance learning program, or even just want to streamline some of your everyday communication tasks.</p>



<h3>Benefits and Drawbacks</h3>



<p>There are several other features that set Google Classroom apart from the competition. It is a free tool and it works on computers and mobile devices through the GAFE platform. The discussion features of Google Classroom do an excellent job at encouraging interaction between students and teachers, making it a very effective tool for working with groups of all sizes. The major drawback to Google Classroom is that it is a relatively new tool, so it does not work with iPads, Android tablets or Kindle Fires. The lessons created within Google Docs can be exported directly into Google Classroom on the computer, but in order to view or edit those documents or upload them onto the iPad tablet, students will have to use other third-party tools such as Documents 5 and iBooks Author.</p>



<h2>Integration</h2>



<p>If you are using Google Classroom for your teaching and learning, it is important to note that it does require integration with Google Apps for Education. This means that you are using Gmail along with Calendar and Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) etc., so the other school faculty members need to have access to all of these tools. The obvious way to do this is through the use of a domain. It is required that you have a domain in order to use Google Classroom or any other GAFE tool/application.</p>



<p>By going through a step by step process, one can easily move one&#8217;s entire digital repository into Google Classroom for easy organization and management; therefore, allowing access to all student work without having to worry about losing any data or files that are not needed for a current class engagement.</p>



<h2>Google Classroom Future Prospects</h2>



<p>According to the Scholastic Parent &amp; Child list of the most popular educational apps , in 2015 Classroom wasn&#8217;t one of them, indicating that this tool is still relatively new and also relatively unknown. While the design is nothing particularly innovative, the new Google Classroom 2022 is a promising step towards more effective and efficient learning, especially in a classroom setting. Though it appears to be geared towards teachers, students will benefit from having access to Google Classroom, whether they&#8217;re in an online or a traditional classroom. With that said, it should be noted that it may take some time before this update fully penetrates into secondary schools and universities. But nonetheless, Google Classroom is off on the right foot, leaning further into an online world which we&#8217;ll all have to face sooner or later.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Google Classroom has made a huge impact in the world of educational technology, especially for teachers who don&#8217;t have face-to-face access to students. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that will likely continue to be developed and improved upon, as educators keep gravitating towards it.</p>



<p>In the end, there is no one best way to teach and learn, but instead many valid options. Whether you are interested in the low-cost education of a MOOC or the high-end technology of Sketchfab virtual reality tours, it&#8217;s exciting to see that educational technology is progressing at a rapid rate. Let&#8217;s hope that as more schools begin to adopt innovative techniques like Google Classroom, we will continue to see positive changes in how students learn around the world.</p>

<p>[Check against delivery]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to speak here this evening, on my home turf.</p>
<p>Now, before I begin, I understand there’s a sweepstake on the length of my remarks.</p>
<p>Let me just put everyone’s mind at rest… my money went on 82 minutes – so settle in folks!</p>
<p>Turning to what this evening is all about… Councillor Tattersall – our new Mayor – congratulations!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Mayor, you will be an outstanding Mayor for our borough. You are a tremendous councillor and a force of nature!</p>
<p>I know you have big plans for your term.</p>
<p>Your theme – Educate, inspire and deliver and your charities typify you…</p>
<p>Romero Communities – a wonderful organisation, who have provided invaluable support to countless people in Barnsley.</p>
<p>And one of the friendliest places to get a brew in the borough!</p>
<p>And Hey! – who do so much for our children and young people suffering with their mental health by providing the care they need when they need it most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The very first time I met Sarah was back in 2011. I was dashing about canvassing for Party members’ support ahead of the selection hustings for the forthcoming by-election.</p>
<p>I knocked on her door.</p>
<p>She kindly invited me in.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>I obviously wanted to take Sarah up on her offer – her endorsement would’ve been very useful, but it suddenly dawned on me this encounter was laden with risk.</p>
<p>The dilemma was such: coming in for a chat, meant taking off my shoes which in turn meant – to my great embarrassment – revealing a hole in my sock.</p>
<p>“Shall I take my shoes off” I said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can just leave them at the door” was the reply.</p>
<p>“Oh dear” I thought – it was actually another 4-letter word, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>I saw coming clean as the best course of action…</p>
<p>“I must apologise in advance, but I have a large hole in my sock” I said.</p>
<p>Now, discussing and exposing my ragged clothing – as you can imagine – was not meant to form part of the agenda for this important tête-à-tête.</p>
<p>Sarah’s response however was both merciful and profound…</p>
<p>“People are more interested in what you have to say rather than the state of your socks. And anyway, lots of people round here have holes in their socks”.</p>
<p>She was right. A sage lesson and one worth remembering.</p>
<p>Madam Mayor – I’m very much looking forward to working with you over the next year.</p>
<p>I have every faith you’ll be a huge success and a fantastic champion for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Congratulations again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, before I go any further I’d like to say a few words about the terrible situation in Ukraine because we are joined here tonight against the backdrop of the most appalling violence and misery.</p>
<p>I know we are all greatly inspired by the resolve, determination and spirit shown by the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>The response to the crisis from our community has been incredibly moving – we opened our hearts and our homes.</p>
<p>Naturally I wouldn’t have expected anything less.</p>
<p>We are of course twinned with a proud coalfield community in Ukraine – Horlivka.</p>
<p>A town which is now fighting for its very existence.</p>
<p>A fight it did not start, but from which it will not back down.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago – along with my great colleague and neighbour, Stephanie Peacock – I learned I had been personally sanctioned by the Russian parliament – something I see as a badge of honour because Barnsley stands united against Putin’s illegal invasion and we send our solidarity to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters both here and those resisting his barbaric regime.</p>
<p>Slava Ukraini!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do also want to say a word about the Platinum Jubilee – truly a milestone in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>The Queen – overseeing us this evening – has been the embodiment of service and stability, a constant in our lives and it is right we recognise her unwavering dedication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen… that brings me to another fantastic ambassador, albeit one closer to home – our outgoing Mayor,</p>
<p>Councillor Caroline Makinson.</p>
<p>Caroline… you have been a wonderful advocate for our community and helped see us through the pandemic. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you for all the work you have done – and will continue to do – for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d also like to say something about another outgoing Mayor… me!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the last time I had the honour of speaking at this event was for Councillor Steve Green back in 2018 – which was only a matter days after I had been elected the inaugural Mayor of South Yorkshire, or the Sheffield City Region as it was then.</p>
<p>I’m now back delivering this address but no longer as Mayor.</p>
<p>Let me be candid, many people were surprised at my decision to stand down, but I said from the beginning that being a Mayor and an MP wasn’t a long-term arrangement.</p>
<p>And I meant it.</p>
<p>Some thought that I would step away as MP and keep going with the mayoralty, but I have a fierce loyalty to our town.</p>
<p>You can’t choose where you were born but you can choose where you want to be – and I chose Barnsley.</p>
<p>I hope everyone knows what an enormous privilege it is for me to represent our community, and how seriously I take that responsibility.</p>
<p>Politicians come and go, of course – and if the people of Barnsley want to get rid of me as their MP, then that is their absolute right. But I am not walking away from them.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why… there is so much to celebrate about Barnsley – but above all, it is the enduring spirit of our people that sets us apart.</p>
<p>And why I hold this place so dear, and why I was never going to walk away from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community knows all too well the arc of history does not always necessarily steer to a better tomorrow. But we also know that together we have the power to bend it toward a more hopeful future.</p>
<p>When you walk through our town, you are walking through a chronicle of our past – lessons in who we are, voices reminding us of what we have achieved, inspiration for generations to come.</p>
<p>Just outside, we have our square dedicated to the Barnsley Pals battalions. Men who stepped forward to answer the call during the First World War.</p>
<p>Miners, glassworkers, stonemasons, clerics – many of them friends and neighbours. They joined-up together, trained together, fought together and ultimately, many of them died together.</p>
<p>It is a legacy that inspired some of Barnsley’s finest to serve. Tom Hicks who lived in Royston – a veteran of Arnhem who helped write the Airborne Forces into the annals of history.</p>
<p>And Sergeant Ian McKay, who was born in the borough – another member of that proud brotherhood, posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his sacrifice on Mount Longdon 40 years ago next month.</p>
<p>From the First World War to the Second, to the Falklands and every other conflict beyond, Barnsley’s men and women have consistently stepped forward to answer the call.</p>
<p>Their story reminds us that the lone hero is a myth – we are all in fact, threads, woven together to create something much stronger.</p>
<p>Walk down the Huddersfield Road and you’ll find the head office of the National Union of Mineworkers – a paragon of our community built on coal.</p>
<p>While the Pals’ struggle took them to foreign soil, the miners’ struggle was brought to their very doorstep.</p>
<p>To their detriment, successive governments failed to recognise it wasn’t just coal that came out from the collieries, but community too.</p>
<p>Theirs was a bond forged over generations. Mineworkers and their families wouldn’t run at the first sign of hardship, they held their ground and withstood hunger, smears and violence.</p>
<p>Their fight is a lesson in the meaning of true solidarity.</p>
<p>Down in our town centre, we now have our COVID memorial sculpture – one of the first in the world.</p>
<p>It’s our tribute to those no longer with us, to those who lost loves ones and to those working-class heroes who sacrificed so much to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Barnsley's fierce love <u>will</u> hold you forever in its heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community was left devasted by the pandemic, I know everyone here this evening has their own story – me included.</p>
<p>That suffering will live long in the memory but so too should the resolve of those who pulled us through – our NHS</p>
<p>workers, carers, delivery drivers, shopworkers, posties, transport staff, and many others. Too often taken for granted but</p>
<p>whose true value was there for all to see during our darkest hour.</p>
<p>Men and women from Barnsley have fought, struggled and laboured time and time again for our tomorrow. Their journey is one we continue.</p>
<p>But our story isn’t just one of triumph over adversity. We are so much more.</p>
<p>Barnsley’s sons and daughters have a long and proud history of stepping out and shaping a better world.</p>
<p>Just look at who was awarded the Freedom of the Borough last month alongside our phenomenal <strong>Intensive Care Unit</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Mat Wright – the musical director of the outstanding Barnsley Youth Choir</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Brunt – the world cup winning cricketer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham Ibbeson – the artist and sculptor</strong></p>
<p><strong>And Katherine Kelly – the acclaimed actress.</strong></p>
<p>Inspirational figures, and every one of them Barnsley to their core.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it isn’t just our people that are doing us proud, it’s our place.</p>
<p>Our town centre has undergone remarkable transformation in recent times – praise rightly goes to the Leader of our Council, Sir Steve Houghton and his team for the incredible progress we have seen.</p>
<p>I am however acutely aware not everyone always shares my enthusiasm for when the winds of change begin to blow!</p>
<p>I remember once being in complete awe stood outside our wonderful Town Hall by the newly installed fountains one summer morning – the sun was shining, children were paddling, laughter filled the air. It was a scene of pure joy.</p>
<p>I paused to soak up the experience when a gentleman appeared beside me.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, I could sense he was poised to deliver his judgement.</p>
<p>He then uttered the following – words that will stay with me evermore…</p>
<p>“It used to be a lovely little car park”</p>
<p>I believe Barnsley deserves more former lovely little car parks – we deserve the best because we are capable of the best.</p>
<p>Anyone who questions that ambition has a short memory, look at what we have achieved and how we have achieved it… as one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In every direction, there is much to do. Just as we emerge from a health crisis, we have entered an economic one. Families facing hardship, businesses facing uncertainty.</p>
<p>The challenges we face today and those we face tomorrow are daunting but like the challenges of yesterday, they will be overcome.</p>
<p>You only have to walk around our community and speak to the people who make it so special to know that holds true.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you take comfort in knowing I still have holes in my socks just as I take comfort in knowing our people don’t care, they are still more interested in what you have to say.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your evening. And Madam Mayor, congratulations once again. Thank you.</p>

<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said: “Our wonderful city of Birmingham is one of the most diverse in the world and truly reflects the Commonwealth. It’s fantastic to see Commonwealth Connections promoting collaboration and encouraging young people to make new connections with people from different backgrounds and different countries. </p>
<p>“The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 affect us all and it’s vital young people, as future leaders, understand why these are so important. By talking to people across the world with different perspectives of how climate change and sustainability is impacting people’s lives is how we show how global Britain can be a force for good.” </p>
<p>During the event, St Paul’s School for Girls was presented with a British Council foundation level <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/accreditation/international-school-award/about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International School Award</a> by the organisation’s Senior Schools Consultant, John Rolfe MBE. The award champions schools that have shown a commitment to embedding international awareness and understanding in their classrooms and curriculums. The £500k Commonwealth Connections project is co-funded by Birmingham 2022 and the British Council.  </p>
<p>The British Council is delivering the project with Birmingham Education Partnership (BEP) and the children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust (YST). BEP has nominated its flagship Birmingham Arts School to lead on delivery of the arts and culture strand of the project. </p>

<p><strong>On Monday morning, Local MP Grant Shapps joined passengers at Welwyn Garden City Station to mark the beginning of new cross-London train services between Welwyn Garden City and Sevenoaks, Kent.</strong></p>



<p>The new Thameslink services will run every half an hour during weekday peak times &#8211; greatly benefitting those who commute into London from the area.</p>



<p>The link makes up the first-ever direct route across central London via Finsbury Park in the north and Elephant &amp; Castle in the south.</p>



<p>Passengers travelling from Welwyn Hatfield will also benefit from better access to the new Elizabeth Line which opens next week.</p>



<p>During the visit, Mr Shapps met with Tom Moran, Managing Director for Thameslink and Great Northern, as well as various other stakeholders from across the constituency, speaking to them about the new Thameslink service.</p>



<p>Commenting on the service Mr Shapps said, “it’s fantastic to see this new service being introduced, not only for the wider region, but also for my own Welwyn Hatfield constituents who will now be able to travel into London that bit easier.</p>



<p>“Increased connectivity between Welwyn Hatfield, London and Kent can only benefit residents, providing them with greater opportunities, and making the area a more prosperous and desirable place to live.”</p>



<p>When speaking of the service Mr Moran said, “We’re delighted we can now provide these extra seats and new journey opportunities for Hertfordshire and Northeast London commuters. The new route is a key part of the service uplift we’ve achieved for our passengers in the new summer timetable introduced this week.</p>



<p>“This timetable is the starting point for rebuilding our railway, working closely with our community and industry partners to support passengers and the economic recovery of both local and regional rail.”</p>

<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br />
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

              <h3>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
