<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is writing to the Scottish Government calling for compensation for businesses in Uist affected by the lack of Lochboisdale sailings in the month of June.</p>



<p>Commenting Mr MacNeil said: “People&#8217;s jobs and livelihoods have been badly affected. The increased ferry traffic since RET has brought greater economic activity and as a result people have risen to meet the opportunities presented, and therefore cannot afford the financial hit when expected services don&#8217;t materialise.</p>



<p>“Given that practical alternatives to provide a ferry service, admittedly lesser than was timetabled, did not materialise, then the only other course of action is for businesses to be compensated for their loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Increased demand is placing greater strain on the ferry service with more people travelling in recent years, but that is not a fault the people in Uist should bear with a hit to their back pocket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do hope the Scottish Government will do the right, fair and decent thing, and compensate businesses.&nbsp; It would be to their great credit if they did.”</p>

<p>Local MP Martin Docherty-Hughes has praised the work of Clydebank-based Carers of West Dunbartonshire in championing the rights of unpaid carers.</p>



<p>SNP MP Docherty-Hughes, a former young carer, paid a visit to the local carers centre in West Dunbartonshire as part of <a href="https://www.carersweek.org/">Carers Week 2023.</a></p>



<p>Carers Week is an annual event which recognises the vital contribution made by people caring unpaid for family members or friends who have a disability, illness, mental health condition, or who need extra help as they grow older.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 800,000 unpaid carers across Scotland, but only a small proportion of that number access the support they’re entitled to.</p>



<p>The area’s MP Martin pledged to continue working to improve outcomes for caregivers across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven.</p>



<p><strong>Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“As a former young carer, I know first-hand the challenges facing many unpaid carers in West Dunbartonshire and across the country.</p>



<p>“Carers make a huge contribution to our communities, but too many miss out on support because their carer roles aren’t recognised quickly enough.</p>



<p>“We’re fortunate to have local groups like the Carers of West Dunbartonshire, who work tirelessly to champion the rights of carers across Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale.</p>



<p>“Carers Week is important in paying tribute to the contribution of caregivers and knowing where they can turn to for support.</p>



<p>“I’m determined to continue working locally and in parliament to ensure carers are properly recognised and supported all year round.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Further information on support available through the Carers of West Dunbartonshire is available at: <a href="http://www.carerswd.org">www.carerswd.org</a> or by calling the carers centre on 0141 941 1550.</em></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am also very aware of the growing concern and frustration of many when it comes to trying to get an appointment at their local GP surgery, or when trying to pick up their prescriptions from their local pharmacy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why I have asked to meet with senior figures from Mid Norfolk’s local surgeries again – and why I am looking forward to visiting South Norfolk Healthcare (a GP provider organisation supporting 23 GP surgeries in the region) next week – to continue the ongoing dialogue I have with GP surgeries and staff throughout the local NHS, and allow me to help them look for solutions both locally and nationally, as well as to raise their feedback with local NHS figures and ministers and officials in Westminster.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Over recent months, I have met with senior figures from Mid Norfolk’s surgeries twice (see more </span></span><a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/news/meeting-local-gp-practices-0"><span>here</span></a><span><span>), and written to Health Ministers as part of my ongoing efforts to ensure the voices of my concerned constituents are being heard at the highest levels and that increased support is provided. I also continue to raise specific concerns and cases from constituents with individual GP surgeries and pharmacies, and am working with councillors and the volunteer ATTCARE team in Attleborough as we look to ensure the local NHS recognises the scale of growth coming to the area and puts in place a proper strategic plan for health and social care in the town (see more </span></span><a href="https://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/news/attcare-update"><span>here</span></a><span><span>).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Despite more than £2billion of investment over the past two years, a commitment to invest a further £1.5billion to create an additional 50 million GP appointments by 2024 and a package of measures aimed at easing pressures on the frontline of primary care (GP surgeries and pharmacies), there is much still to do however –  and I am determined to do all I can to work with local stakeholders and ministers in order to deliver the improvements we need to see.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

<p>Cumbrian MP Tim Farron has written to YMCA, urging them to make sure community is protected on the lakefront at Windermere.</p>
<p>It comes as YMCA North Camp near Newby Bridge has been put up for sale.</p>
<p>On Friday, Tim was presented with a 1,500-signature strong at South Windermere Sailing Club which called for community access to the site to be protected.</p>
<p>In his letter to the YMCA Tim said: <em>"Having recently completed the Windermere Marathon, it emphasised to me all the more how little of the frontage of England's biggest and most popular lake is accessible to the people it is meant to be there for.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"The YMCA has had a sterling history of making sure that the sites it operates on the shore of Windermere have been accessible to the public.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"With news of the impending sale of the property comes the expected fears of change that may see access to the lakefront limited by the new owners.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Even if YMCA feel they have no choice but to sell, we should ensure that the land is sold with the caveat that access must be retained at the same level that is currently enjoyed by the public."</em>

<p>This Carers Week, I took part in a deeply moving debate in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Our care system is stretched to the absolute limit – so much so that 2.5 million unpaid carers have had to give up work or reduce their hours because they cannot get the support they need. In modern Britain, social care should thought about as being as much a part of our economic infrastructure as the roads and the railways, and must therefore be at the very heart of our economic policy and strategy for growth.</p>

<p>Anyone seeking a new home to buy or rent knows that the housing market in Bristol is a mess. Those seeking to buy need a deposit few on average wages can afford without help from relatives, private rented accommodation is insecure and far too often of poor quality, and despite the construction of new council properties social rent homes remain scarce.</p>
<p>Low levels of house building over previous decades have helped fuel a never-ending spiral of house price increases. Although many in south Bristol, who already own a home, have seen their house value increase, many older residents can’t find high quality homes so they can ‘downsize’, which would potentially release family sized properties.</p>
<p>Due to the housing shortage, we also have a rental market shortage. This is most acute in cities like Bristol, but it is replicated in every town and village across the UK. Market forces mean that some unscrupulous buy-to-let owners can charge exorbitant rates. This bleak picture only gets worse if you are reliant on Local Housing Allowance (LHA) to help pay the rent due to a low income.</p>
<p>A survey by the campaign group Generation Rent in December 2022 found that half of respondents who had rented their home for over a year had been asked for a rent increase by their landlord. Nearly half of all rent increases were of over £50 a month. Along with the Resolution Foundation think tank they have called for an increase in LHA rates, which have been frozen in cash terms for the past three years.</p>
<p>And herein lies another problem with our faltering housing market: the cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>The longer national Government fails to deliver more homes the longer the bill for LHA will increase. It is wrong for the Conservative Government to have frozen this support payment for nearly three years. The short-term solution is uprating LHA, but that won’t solve the underlying problem.</p>
<p>This cannot be fixed with the swish of a magic wand. We must look at how we legislate against large house building companies buying land and refusing to develop until the value rockets. We must look at planning law on inner-city house building and of course, we must look at how we protect renters from poor landlords.</p>
<p>There are some grounds for optimism locally, more new social rent housing is under construction in on East Street, Winterstoke Road, North Street and elsewhere. Dozens of families in south Bristol will be moving in to new socially rented homes in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But failure by national Government to prioritise housebuilding of all tenures means waiting lists for such homes remain obscenely high, and with over 1,000 households in temporary accommodation, families suffer and taxpayers continue to foot the bill.</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2023/06/12/south-bristol-voice-column-april-2023/">South Bristol Voice Column :: April 2023</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p><span data-contrast="auto">Small and micro businesses in our community are feeling the weight of the economic crisis. The dual impact of rising inflation and the cost-of-living crisis is putting a strain on their small operations, and it&#8217;s clear they need our support more than ever.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the most significant challenges many of our smaller businesses face is the VAT threshold, currently set at £85,000. In practical terms, this means that once a business hits this turnover, it must register for VAT, which brings with it a host of additional costs. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Understandably, this is causing a lot of worry for our business owners, many of whom are hesitant to expand their operations because of these potential costs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has come up with a solution that I wholeheartedly support &#8211; they&#8217;re calling for an increase in the VAT threshold from £85,000 to £100,000. This isn&#8217;t just about numbers on a balance sheet. It&#8217;s about giving our local businesses the confidence to grow and continue to support our local economy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Previous studies by the FSB indicate that 24% of small businesses perceive the VAT limit as an obstacle to expansion, as they try to prevent the abrupt expenses associated with exceeding this limit in an effort to maintain customer affordability. The predicament has become more acute due to the rising inflation and ongoing impacts of Brexit, making growth a costly endeavour for small businesses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span><span>The event has been organised amongst others by Julian Glover who wrote a Landscape Review for the Government as part of which he had visited Shropshire Hills AONB.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We were told it was the first time such an event had been held for 20 years. There were cross party contributions from Thérèse Coffey from Suffolk, Rory Stewart from Cumbria, the Labour rural affairs spokesman who represents Cambridge, and Lord Mandelson who formerly lived in Herefordshire.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>There was a wide consensus that rural Britain has much to offer the population in terms of health and recreation as well as vital for food security. But important points were also made about how to engage urban dwellers, who make up 70% of the population, to engage with and access rural areas safely and affordably.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Thérèse Coffey pointed out that the vast majority of the Cabinet represent rural areas, including the Prime Minister, in contrast to the urban focussed opposition teams. Labour hold 17 out of 199 rural constituencies in England and Wales.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>She highlighted some positive current initiatives, including the £110m Rural England Prosperity Fund currently open for capital grants for rural businesses and the £150m Community Ownership Fund to enable local communities to retain valued local assets.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>She announced new initiatives to remove barriers to rural enterprise, including a consultation on extending permitted development rights for amending existing buildings in addition to recent changes to facilitate new farm shops. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>She also announced an acceleration of completing roll-out of Project Gigabit to reach remaining rural areas, including those parts of South Shropshire who still lack adequate connectivity to procure all remaining contracts by the end of 2024.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>She recognised the importance of improving transport in rural areas and will soon be launching a Future of Transport Rural Strategy, for example to explore how demand responsive bus networks to link remote rural areas can be established.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>She also emphasised the need to support more local housing in rural areas and is launching a scheme funded by DEFRA to enable each of 40 local authority areas to promote an affordable housing scheme working with local landowners and communities.

<p>Every morning, my team and I trawl through the latest constituency cases, and set to work looking at how we can help.</p>
<p>Every case is different. Some &#8211; like dislodged paving stones or missed bin collections &#8211; can usually be addressed relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Others &#8211; like visa applications or crime &#8211; are more complex and require more detailed work.</p>
<p>The cases that really make my heart sink, however, are housing related. That’s because I know securing good quality, affordable housing is increasingly becoming an exercise akin to finding hens teeth.</p>
<p>A combination of Right to Buy mismanagement, extortionate private rents and failure to build enough social housing or starter homes means that for many, the housing market is fundamentally broken.</p>
<p>England now has among the lowest numbers of homes per 1,000 people in Western Europe. The charity Shelter estimates that over 1 million people are waiting for social homes.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate how catastrophic figures like these are for many households. Not only are people being shut out of the dream of owning their home, when they are stepping into the rental market they are finding themselves acutely vulnerable to high rents and rogue landlords.</p>
<p>The solution, as Labour has made clear, is to get Britain building.</p>
<p>That means overhauling planning laws so that good quality green space is protected while low quality sites, like disused shrubland and petrol stations, are utilised for the creation of genuinely affordable housing.</p>
<p>Labour would give councils in England new powers to buy land at lower prices to boost housebuilding, something that could be truly transformational for communities right across the country.</p>
<p>This work would come alongside clamping down on shoddy landlords and appalling housing conditions, which are causing health outcomes in many deprived communities to worsen at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Safe, decent and affordable housing is not, and should never be, a privilege afforded to the few. I’m fed up of seeing hard working people in Tameside losing out because of a poor planning system and a Government that has failed to proactively tackle this crisis.</p>
<p>But the situation is not futile. With action, we can build a Britain where affordable housing is the norm, and where the dream of home ownership can become a reality again.</p>

<p>We have all been shocked by the proposal by the Conservative UK Government to use the Stradey Park Hotel as emergency accommodation for 200 asylum seekers from July. Tory Ministers are scrabbling around looking for more hotel accommodation, because of their monumental failure to process the backlog of asylum claims, so those from safe countries could be sent home.   <a> </a></p>



<p>This proposal
shows the utter arrogance of Tory Ministers who have failed to properly consult
surrounding communities, the Welsh Government, Carmarthenshire County Council,
the police and many others and, following secretive talks with the hotel
owners, rejected all other alternatives and&nbsp;run roughshod over local
opinion.</p>



<p>Wales is a
welcoming country and, here in Llanelli, we have proudly played our part down
the years in supporting those who have fled war and persecution elsewhere in
the world in pursuit of safety.&nbsp; </p>



<p>However, this
proposal is unworkable, risks putting extra pressure on local services and
creates a situation that could prove problematic for nearby residents and for
the asylum seekers themselves.&nbsp; </p>



<p>I will continue
to vigorously oppose this plan for those reasons.</p>



<p>Together with
local councillors, I am actively campaigning to reverse this plan and we are
doing everything we can to stand up for the communities we represent.&nbsp; We
have offered our support to the Action Committee set up by local residents and
are urging people to sign their petition, either online or in person.</p>



<p>In Parliament, I
have already questioned the Minister for Immigration directly to emphasise the
strength of opposition against this and requested urgent meetings with him,
Clearsprings (an intermediary that manages the accommodation) and the hotel
owners themselves to keep up the pressure for this proposal to be dropped.</p>



<p>I know that the
County Council are also exploring all options open to them too.</p>



<p>This is a fast
moving situation and I will do my best to keep people informed of what is
happening and to let them how they can get involved to help.</p>

<p><strong>As many people die from preventable hip fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes, Judith Cummins MP has revealed.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking on Tuesday in the House of Commons, Bradford South MP Judith Cummins called on the Government to step up its game on bone fracture prevention and save lives.</p>



<p>Judith has been vocal on the issue of Osteoporosis, which affects half of all women and a fifth of all men over 50. It is characterised by a loss of bone density, leaving people vulnerable to breaks and fractures. Because symptoms often aren’t noticed until a serious break, osteoporosis has been called the ‘silent disease’.</p>



<p>Raising the issue in Parliament, Judith highlighted the shocking reality of the condition:</p>



<p>‘Many of these will be serious hip fractures, and as many people will die from these fractures as from lung cancer or diabetes.’</p>



<p>Questioning the Minister, Judith asked why such a serious condition is so often overlooked in healthcare:</p>



<p>‘Can the Minister explain why not even one of the 63 key performance indicators set by NHS England for Integrated Care Boards sets a target for fracture prevention?’</p>



<p>Responding, Maria Caulfield MP, Minister for Women’s Health Strategy, thanked Judith for her longstanding work on bone health. The Minister also highlighted measures the Government is undertaking to tackle Osteoporosis:</p>



<p>‘NHS England is expanding fracture services for higher risk women who do have Osteoporosis to prevent falls in the first place.’</p>



<p>Despite the Government’s claims to be stepping up fracture services, the limits of the current services mean that 74,000 preventable fractures will occur over the next five years, costing the NHS £665 million.</p>



<p>Making fracture prevention a key performance target could lead to stronger delivery of these services, preventing unnecessary pain, giving patients the level of care they deserve, and saving vital NHS resources.</p>



<p>Following the exchange, Judith said that Government support for fracture prevention was still inadequate:</p>



<p>‘Whilst Bradford offers a trailblazing service for those with Osteoporosis, this is not always the case nationally.’</p>



<p>‘The argument for investing in the prevention of fractures is clear: To save money and save lives, we need a government with the sense to invest in the future of women’s health in this country.’</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the 22<sup>nd</sup> May, International Biodiversity Day, I attended a joint meeting of the International Conservation APPG and the Climate Change APPG, organised and chaired by Barry Gardiner MP who is chair of the former. The topic for discussion was “Biomass: Bad for Biodiversity and Bad for Climate Change”, which provided a timely opportunity to talk about all the biodiversity issues surrounding biomass and BECC, especially with the UK Government’s biomass strategy expected to be published in the near future. The speakers included: Matt Williams, senior advocate Forest Protection Nature Program, NRDC; Prof Mike Norton, Environment Programme Director at the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (EASAC); Eamonn Ives, former special advisor to UK COP President Alok Sharma, Head of Research, The Entrepreneurs; Duncan Brac, Environmental Policy analyst and advisor, former SpAd at the Department of Energy and Climate Change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The main business in the Chamber was the return of the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-05-22/debates/DE7D768F-2624-49B7-A053-2A644CD0B2CE/Strikes(MinimumServiceLevels)Bill">Strikes (Minimum Service Level) Bill</a> from the Lords, who had made 7 amendments and we voted on Amendments 1,2,4, and 5 (because 6&amp;7 are consequential on 5) at the end of the debate. The procedure is that each Lords Amendment must be accepted, altered, replaced, or rejected by MPs. The UK Government were opposed to all Lords Amendments, and voted to reject them. Amendment 1 would insert new subsections to Clause 4 to restrict its application to only England. The Government won by 288-227 votes. Amendment 2 would require consultation and review by a committee of each House takes place before the Secretary of State makes new regulations under s234B to specify minimum service levels. The UK Government won by 286-231. Amendment 4 would insert a new section 234CA to require a copy of a work notice to be given to a person who will be subject to it, employers must prove they’ve done this, and failure to comply with the work notice is not a breach of contract of employment, so the person cannot be dismissed or suffer detriment as a result. The Government won by 286-232 votes. Amendment 5 would remove s234E (no protection if trade union fails to take reasonable steps) to ensure that trade unions do not have any responsibility or obligation to ensure their members comply with a work notice. The Government won by 287-232 votes, and therefore, Amendments 6/7 were not voted on. The Bill has gone back to the Lords for them to consider whether to insist on any of their original Amendments or offer alternatives, and send them back to the Commons, known as “ping-pong”.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was elected a vice chair at the AGM of APPG for Ukraine, and Bob Seely MP and Alex Sobel MP were re-elected co-chairs. We received a confidential briefing about the current state of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we all agreed that NATO should vote to proscribe the Wagner Group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/">Dignity in Dying</a> reception organised by its patron Dame Prue Leith to pledge my ongoing support for the campaign for a national conversation on assisted dying which is currently happening in Scotland, Jersey, Isle of Man, Ireland and France. Prue has called on Party leaders to listen to the voices of dying people and the public at large who are overwhelmingly supportive of a change in the law.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was honoured to be re-elected chair at the AGM of the APPG for Sepsis, and I look forward to continuing to work with the <a href="https://sepsistrust.org/">UK Sepsis Trust</a> to help to improve lives of people and families who have been affected by sepsis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the APPG for Vegetarianism and Veganism, I attended the launch of the Vegetarian for Life report “Diet and Identity in Care Settings: A Systematic Literature Review”. Anna Boardman, lead researcher for the report, presented its aims and objectives. Food is often a meaningful activity in our lives. For those who follow a religion, food can be an extension of their faith, or a means by which to exercise one’s ethical, political, or philosophical beliefs, regarding the environment, animal welfare, or animal rights. Food can play a symbolic role in the way we view ourselves, as part of families, and members of society. The changes in aging can mean choices become limited, restricted, or superseded. Mealtimes can be the highlight of residents’ days, but often the meals served do not reflect the diversity in the resident’s needs. There are examples of vegans and vegetarians being served meat. The report aimed to explore existing research and identify the gaps in knowledge. Barriers to food provision came through knowledge and education, carers made nutrition choices, rather than beliefs and preferences, residents were not good self-advocates, temporary untrained food assistants, medicines without animal products. The research focused on care homes and the older demographic, but indicates it is pertinent where people have reduced autonomy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am supporting Anna Firth MP who introduced the first reading of her <a href="https://www.conservativeanimalwelfarefoundation.org/legislation-policy-bills/conservative-animal-welfare-foundation-patron-anna-firth-mp-leads-first-reading-of-emilies-law/">10-Minute Rule Bill “Animal Welfare (Responsibility for Dog Attacks)”</a> in the chamber this week. The Bill will seek to criminalise fatal dog-on-dog attacks because currently dog owners are not liable when their dog fatally attacks another dog. Anna has called her Bill ‘Emilie’s Law’ after her constituent Michael’s bichon fris called Emilie was tragically killed in a dog attack in 2021.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the <a href="https://www.sra.org.uk/">Solicitors’ Regulation Authority</a> (SRA) Parliamentary Reception for Welsh MPs and Peers to meet the chair, board members, and senior management team. Speakers included: Shadow Secretary of State for Wales, Jo Stevens MP; Plaid Cymru Justice Spokesperson, Liz Saville-Roberts MP; and Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies MP. The SRA is the largest regulator of legal services in England and Wales, covering 90% of the legal market. In Wales, the SRA oversees 4000 solicitors, and more than 400 law firms who have their head offices based in Wales. The SRA works to set and maintain high professional standards, protect members of the public and support the rule of law and administration of justice. The SRA recently set out a commitment to develop its presence in Wales, and take full account of Wales throughout its work, in particular, taking account of Welsh Law in the new Solicitor’s Qualifying Exa, and developing opportunities for aspiring solicitors to sit this exam through the medium of Welsh. In 2021, the SRA recruited its first Head of Welsh Affairs, and opened an office in Cardiff. I hope to visit the new office in the near future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The business in the Chamber was the Official Opposition Day, and there were two debates: Leasehold Reform (England only); Safety of School Buildings (Education is devolved to Wales and to Scotland). At the end of each debate there was a vote. The UK Government instructed their Conservative MPs not to take part in the Leasehold Reform vote, which the official opposition and other parties won 174-0. The vote on the second debate was lost by 171-296 votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was re-elected a vice chair at the AGM of the APPG for Flooding, my friend Rachael Maskell MP was re-elected chair. The business for the forthcoming year will include Flood Defence Grant in Aid Scheme (FDGIA), Levelling Up, Planning, Property Flood Resilience, Frequently Flooded Communities, and Riparian Ownership. At this meeting we had an update from the frequently flooded area, Shrewsbury Flood Action Group, which stated that it had flooded 18 times since 1977, but they don’t qualify for the criteria under the FDGIA, and these criteria need to be changed. The mental health of frequently flooded people is being seriously affected, as well as the costs of repairing houses and replacing contents. It’s also difficult to obtain house and contents insurance under these circumstances. Peter Grant, Funding Manager at the Environment Agency, explained that the FDGIA is based on a partnership funding model, the more a scheme costs the more grant is available, it’s a big town model, so it’s more complicated for dispersed houses that don’t reach the criteria which DEFRA sets. Some schemes cost more than the grant available. I stated that the criteria should be updated to include inflation and building oncosts, so that the grants are increased to reflect actual flooding costs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was pleased to support the #KnowYourSkin Melanoma Awareness Month drop-in event in Parliament, organised by the charity <a href="https://melanomafocus.org/">Melanoma Focus</a>, and hosted by Sir Chris Bryant MP. We were encouraged to check our skin and contact our GP if there’s a new change in moles/lesions and protect our skin with SPF30+ sunscreen. The charity has found that 86% of melanoma skin cancer is preventable, which is increasing to over 16,000 new cases per annum, in 15-44 age group melanoma is the second most common cancer in males and the third most common in females, and it is the deadliest cancer. Several cancer charities are campaigning for high factor protective creams to be VAT exempt, which is now at 20%, because the cost-of-living crisis has caused many people and families to struggle to buy these essential items, and could be contributing to the rise in cancer in the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As vice chair of the <a href="https://rjappg.co.uk/">APPG for Restorative Justice</a> (RJ), I attended our regular monthly meeting to listen to an update from our 2023 Workstreams which were set up to progress the recommendations made in our report “Restorative Practices 2021/22”, following an enquiry bringing 50 leading practitioners together to take evidence. At this meeting we heard from the Devolved Administration Group; Internal Management Group; and External Management Group. We also discussed the forthcoming “Victims and Prisoners Bill” which does not mention RJ and the possibility of APPG members tabling an RJ amendment to the Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I supported the launch of the <a href="https://batonofhopeuk.org/">Baton of Hope</a> Workplace Charter. The founder John McCarthy believes that “suicides are preventable, and everyone can play a part in supporting a move towards a zero suicide society”. In the UK there are still 17 suicides a day, despite numerous initiatives. The six principles of the charter are: make suicide awareness, support, and prevention a workplace priority; use clear and consistent messaging about suicide for internal communication and induction training; implement suicide prevention, early detection, prevention and supportive services; embrace those with lived experience; promote crisis services, suicide prevention advice, counselling, training and support; and promote the charter to increase awareness. Employers have a crucial role to play in suicide prevention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a supporter of the <a href="https://www.league.org.uk/">League Against Cruel Sports</a> (LACS) for many years, and was pleased to attend their event to highlight that hunting with dogs has continued in England and Wales because of the weaknesses in the Hunting Act, and the use of “trail” hunting as a smokescreen for illegal hunting. There are nine exemptions and a loophole that allows hunts to claim that chasing and killing an animal was accidental, so the law fails to protect animals from cruelty. During the 2022-23 hunting season, the LACS compiled 1367 incidents of fox hunts wreaking havoc and involved or suspected of illegal hunting, drawn from the LACS Crimewatch service and hunt monitors. 841 cases of hunt havoc such as railway trespass, chasing pets, and 526 reports of illegal hunting, including 400 cases of a hunt been seen chasing a fox, involving 122 hunts, across 50 counties in the UK. The UK Government has refused to strengthen the law, but police cannot enforce it because it is not fit for purpose. The UK Government allows hunting on its Ministry of Defence land, granting 22 licences for “trail” hunting in 2022. In January 2023, the Scottish Government passed Hunting with Dogs (Scotland) Act to close loopholes in the law exploited by Scottish hunts, and bans “trail” hunting. Calculus Polling in 2022 found 78% of British voters support strengthening the hunting ban, 71% in rural constituencies, of which 87% are Labour voters, 81% Liberal Democrat voters, 71% Conservative voters. The LACS is calling for the Hunting Act to be strengthened by removing exemptions, banning “trail” hunting, and introducing custodial sentences.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I joined representatives from the <a href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/">Youth Sport Trust</a> to support National Schools Sports Week, which will take place from 19-25th June. National Schools Sports Week aims to address the fact that less than half (47%) of all young people across the UK are active for at least 60 minutes of moderate exercise a day as recommended by the Chief Medical Officers. The campaign will see activities take place across the UK to “play for fun-play for 60” which is so important when children’s wellbeing is in decline, obesity and type 2 diabetes cases are rising. The schools in Neath that have already signed up to support this very worthwhile initiative are Cwmnedd Primary and Llangatwg Community School, but I am proud to support this fantastic campaign that helps young people experience the benefit of PE, Sports, and play, and I’m looking forward to working with schools and parents in my Neath constituency to take part and reach their full potential. As a former Welsh Squash International and former Development Officer and National Coach for Squash Wales I realise the importance of taking part in sport to improve physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The APPG for Sport held a Community and Social Sport event to promote the <a href="https://www.sportfordevelopmentcoalition.org/sites/default/files/file/Sport%20for%20Development%20Coalition%20-%20%23OpenGoal%20Annual%20Report%202022-23.pdf">Annual Report for the Sport for Development Coalition 2022-23 #OpenGoal</a>. The room was packed full of sport and community representatives, including some from Wales. The chair of the Coalition Andy Reed OBE, appointed in 2020, introduced the report, emphasising that sport and physical activity have a big part to play in building a fairer, more equitable, and sustainable future, and there is a generational crisis involving substantial health, economic, and societal impacts. The report aims to demonstrate the value of targeted sport-based interventions being delivered within communities in the greatest need of levelling up. As a former Welsh Squash International and former Squash Wales National coach, I pledged my support to the very commendable aims of the Coalition to use sport to make a positive difference to people’s lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The main business in the Chamber on the penultimate day before recess was the Lords sending their Amendments back to the Commons after the MPs had previously disagreed with their Amendments to the <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-05-24/debates/7B12F8E3-6C97-4C3B-8FD8-716107DF4252/RetainedEULaw(RevocationAndReform)Bill">Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill</a> known as “ping-pong”. We voted on 4 Amendments that the Lords sent back and the UK Government won all the votes again, after instructing Conservative MPs to disagree. Lords Amendment 1 was about Joint Committee scrutiny of the sunset schedule, and the UK Government won by 298-216 votes. Lords Amendment 6 to which the Commons previously disagreed because the retention of anything which is retained by EU law by virtue of section 4 of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 would be inconsistent with the principle of supremacy of EU law, was defeated again by 296-215 votes. Lords Amendment 15 to which the Commons previously disagreed because the Commons do not consider this amendment necessary in order to maintain environmental protection or food standards was defeated again by 294-217 votes. And Lords Amendment 42 to which the Commons previously disagreed because the Commons consider the scrutiny procedure imposed by the Lords Amendment to be inappropriate was defeated again by 294-217 votes. The Bill has been “ping-ponged” to the Lords again for their consideration after recess on Tuesday 6th June.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Back in Neath, at the end of my week, I called into <a href="https://twitter.com/StDavidsNeath?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">St David’s Church</a> to support the volunteers at the Saturday morning shop, and watched our highly skilled flower arranger Rosemary preparing the church for up and coming services. I also called into St Thomas’s Church to see the fantastic exhibition of weddings past and present organised by Neath Mothers’ Union (NMU). Many members of NMU and church had lent their wedding gowns, memorabilia, photographs/albums, and the Parish Marriage Records were on display.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Nottingham Labour confirmed today (22 May) at Full Council the political and civic leadership of the city, after securing an increased majority at the local elections. A total of 51 out of 55 councillors at Nottingham City Council, are now Labour. This gives us a strong mandate to implement the manifesto over the next four years and continue to fight for and improve the lives of Nottingham residents.<br></p>



<p>Councillor David Mellen will remain as Leader of the council, continuing the hard work of continuing the hard work of himself, Cllr Adele Williams, Cllr Sally Longford and all previous and current executive and backbench members. He is responsible for continuing devolution, strategic regeneration, development and work on the city’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral by 2028, as well as promoting the vision of the council and supporting all of his Portfolio Holders in their work. There is much work to be done over the next term and the new executive will be key in achieving the goals Nottingham Labour want for the city.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Audra Wynter has been confirmed as the new Deputy Leader and she will have responsibility for the finance and HR portfolios. With a background in finance work, Councillor Wynter will ensure the council remains on track in delivering a balanced budget and sticking to the Medium-Term Financial Plan, while delivering high-quality services for residents.</p>



<p><br></p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Councillor Corall Jenkins will be taking over as Portfolio Holder for Energy, Environment and Waste Services and Parks. She will have responsibility for key services such as bin collection and disposal, keeping our city’s streets clean and maintaining all of our wonderful parks.</p>



<p>Councillor Cheryl Barnard will remain as Portfolio Holder for Children, Young People and Education. She will continue to be responsible for leading our children’s services, working with Ofsted to improve it where necessary, ensuring children’s safeguarding and working with academy trusts across the city on schools, ensuring attendance and working to reduce exclusions, so that all children get the best start in life.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Steve Battlemuch will be taking up the reins as Portfolio Holder for Skills, Growth, Economic Development and Property. He will lead on skills and employment, ensuring that the workforce in the city is prepared for any changes in the way we work, and that the people of this city have the right opportunities. He will also oversee the management of the city centre, attracting investment and helping to ensure that Nottingham is promoted nationally and internationally to business and tourism.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Jay Hayes has been confirmed as the new Portfolio Holder for Housing. He will lead on managing the council housing service, student housing, private rented properties and areas such as selective licensing and homelessness. Housing is incredibly important, all those who live in the city deserve to have a property that is safe, secure and that can be called home, whether they rent in the private sector or have social housing.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Sajid Mohammed will lead as Portfolio Holder for Neighbourhoods, Safety and Inclusion. This covers areas such as community protection, domestic violence work, licensing, taxi strategy and more. It is so important that Nottingham is a safe place to work and live in. Councillor Mohammed with many years of experience of community work and as director of Himmah will bring the required expertise to lead in these vital areas, and he will also lead on refugee and asylum seeker work, to ensure that Nottingham is a welcoming city for all, and that those vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers can integrate and make new lives in Nottingham.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Pavlos Kotsonis will continue as Portfolio Holder for Leisure and Culture. He will ensure that we continue to offer an outstanding events programme. He will also oversee the reopening and flourishing of the Castle, the continued running of Wollaton Hall and Newstead Abbey as well as leisure centres, markets, libraries and community centres across the city. Access to cultural events and key things like libraries and leisure centres is so important for allowing the people of the city to thrive and create.<br></p>



<p>Councillor Linda Woodings will also remain as Portfolio Holder for Adult Social Care and Health. She will continue to work on Public Health and Wellbeing, tackling health inequalities and working to reduce smoking prevalence, working on mental health and generally improving the health of residents in the city. She will also lead on independent living. All of these will help to improve the quality and length of life for residents in the city for years to come.<br></p>



<p>Finally, Councillor Angela Kandola will be taking over as Portfolio Holder for Highways, Transport and Planning. She will oversee public transport such as buses and the tram. She will also lead on greener transport such as cycling and cycling links in the city, ensure highways are correctly managed and repaired as well as the Workplace Parking Levy to help increase public transport usage.<br></p>



<p>This is just a short summary of the responsibilities that the Executive will have for the next year. They will bring both their expertise and new views to help ensure that there is strong and effective political leadership at the council. This will continue both our journey with the Improvement and Assurance Board but also enable us to bring in the pledges that we made to the residents of the city in our manifesto in the May local elections.</p>

<p><strong>Grant Shapps, the local MP for Welwyn Hatfield, visited Peartree Primary School in his constituency and met with staff and students.<br><br></strong>During his visit, Mr Shapps caught up with the staff of Peartree and learnt all about their plans for transformation over the next few years. Thanks to the Conservative Government’s School Rebuilding programme, Peartree was a beneficiary of the programme which is backed by £1.8 billion of government funding over this financial year.<br><br>Mr Shapps was thrilled to see that Peartree had benefited from this funding and looks forward to seeing their transformation. In the past, Mr Shapps helped free up playground space at Peartree by getting a disused Victorian loo block removed which has helped generations of pupils enjoy a little more&nbsp;open&nbsp;space.<br><br>Mr Shapps also met with student members of the school council who asked him an array of questions about his career, local issues and his life as the constituency&#8217;s parliament member. The members of the school council are aged between five and eleven and are elected by their classmates to give them a voice in Peartree School’s vision, projects and events.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Mr Shapps commented on his visit and on his time with members of the school council:<br><br>“It was a pleasure to catch up with staff and visit pupils at Peartree School last week. The children are clearly enjoying their time there very much, and it was really helpful to get an insight from Miss Hardy and her team as to how everyone’s getting on. Plus, I enjoyed a brilliant sit-down with the School Council &#8211; they really put me through my paces with their questions.”<br><br>Megan Hardy, the Head of School at Peartree, thanked Mr Shapps for visiting and meeting with the staff and students:<br><br>“It was a pleasure to show Mr Shapps around Peartree and to talk to him about our plans for the school’s transformation over the coming years.”<br><br>She continued:<br><br>“The children were really excited to meet their MP and they came up with plenty of interesting questions to ask him. They were very inspired by his visit, so we may even have a future prime minister among us!”&nbsp;<br><br>Mr Shapps thanks Peartree for having him visit and wishes the staff and students all the best for the future.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my latest email newsletter to provide you with some updates on what&#8217;s been happening both in Parliament and around Amber Valley. Below you&#8217;ll find an update on some of the things that have been progressing through the Houses in London as well as some of the local visits I&#8217;ve been on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Illegal migration bill update:</u></strong></p>



<p>The main piece of legislation that has been going through the House of Commons in the last few weeks is the Illegal Migration Bill. I’ve heard from a number of constituents with a diverse range of views on this topic. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of April the bill completed its remaining stages in the Commons and is now moving through the House of Lords, before it will return to the Commons for a final review.</p>



<p>This Bill is set to enhance the powers of the Government to tackle illegal migration, including the ability to remove illegal migrants from the UK to safe countries, new ways to determine ages of migrants without formal identification, additional protections for child migrants, and tougher sentences for those found guilty of people smuggling. The Bill was also amended during its remaining stages to include the Government’s commitment to review the safe and legal routes that are available.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need an asylum system that does work for those families truly in need, but is also tough on those who are trying to exploit the process to gain entry to the UK and on human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable people and worsening the crisis. The new bill tackles the latter problems, while leaving open safe and legal routes for those in need.</p>



<p><strong><u>Sewage &amp; storm overflows update:</u></strong></p>



<p>Another key development in Parliament was new plans to further increase water quality targets and reduce sewage being released into our waterways.</p>



<p>The Government has announced its plan to enshrine the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published last August, into law through the Environment Act. This will make its target to reduce storm overflows legally binding. The Government’s Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, published in August 2022, set out stringent targets to protect people and the environment and is backed up by up to £56 billion capital investment, which is the largest infrastructure programme in water company history.</p>



<p>Further, the Government is now consulting on proposals for unlimited fines to be imposed on water companies that break the rules. More than £142 million has already been levied in fines since 2015 and I am aware that money from fines and penalties will now be channelled back into the environment.</p>



<p><strong><u>East Midlands APPG:</u></strong></p>



<p>Outside the Chamber, the focus seemed to be local issues over the last few weeks, and we had another meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the East Midlands. This group brings together MPs from across the Chamber to discuss issues that are especially important to our region.</p>



<p>The most recent meeting was on the future of Infrastructure in the East Midlands. We heard from the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and East Midlands Councils on infrastructure in our area and the need for infrastructure investment to fulfil our environmental commitments, to make it easier for people living here to travel and get to work, and to encourage businesses to move here.</p>



<p>Moving forward, we will continue to push for our region to receive funding in the future, by collecting evidence on the wider benefits of infrastructure projects to the local economy and local businesses and use this in future proposals for funding.</p>



<p><strong><u>Ferrero sustainable palm oil event:</u></strong></p>



<p>I was also able to welcome Ferrero, who own the Thornton’s factory in Somercotes, to Parliament. They hosted an event alongside Chester Zoo and the Orangutan Land Trust on Sustainable Palm Oil, where they discussed the damage palm oil farming has inflicted on jungles and local habitats of orangutans around the world. While many food producers have moved away from palm oil for these reasons, the same problems of deforestation and habitat destruction continue to persist regardless of the plant used.</p>



<p>Because of this, Ferrero highlighted the use of certified sustainable palm-oil to that avoids these poor practices by working with local wildlife experts, stopping further deforestation for farming land, and reducing the impact on the environment.</p>



<p>It was great to hear from a business that operates locally in our area that is tackling global issues and to talk to the charitable organisations that were supporting these efforts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council elections 4th May 2023 &amp; Parish/Town Council elections:</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 4th May 2023, elections were held for Amber Valley Borough Council. For the first time in a long time, elections were held for all 42 councillors over 18 wards (rather than the previous recent system of electing a third of councillors each year).</p>



<p>As a result of the election, the Labour Group took control of the Council and have 26 councillors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congratulations to all who were elected and I look forward to working with the new Borough Council where needed and holding them to account where necessary too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find your borough councillor <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the parish and town councils in Amber Valley were also up for election. You can find the results of these <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/councillors-and-elections/parish-and-town-councils/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to Cash &#8211; Nationwide Heanor:</u></strong></p>



<p>I know for many constituents a key concern has been the closures of bank branches in our area.</p>



<p>Although banking is increasingly moving online, in-person branches are still relied upon by many in our communities and are staples in our high streets. People need access to bank branches so that they can speak to someone in person about their accounts and finances.</p>



<p>I was able to visit Nationwide in Heanor to discuss this issue and was reassured that they understood the important role they play on our high streets and intend to stay open for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>I was also able to discuss the work they are doing to help vulnerable people more broadly, including their cost-of-living helpline, fraud prevention and work to teach useful financial skills to young people.</p>



<p>I’ll continue to support maintaining access to bank branches and cash in our communities and town centres.</p>

<p><strong><u>Christopher Nieper Foundation visit:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Alfreton I joined Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in a visit related to the Christopher Nieper Education Trust. The Trust was set up to allow David Nieper Ltd to invest in local education and help young people into long-term, rewarding employment.</p>



<p>We visited David Nieper Ltd and met with Dr Hobbs, the Headteacher of David Nieper Academy, others who are supporting the work of the Trust and met with a student to do an interview for the Spirit of Alfreton. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Local primary school visits:</u></strong></p>



<p>I have also able to visit both Mundy Junior School and Heage Primary School to speak to teachers and school leaders about funding.</p>



<p>With schools also being hit with high energy bills, there was concern that planned increases to teacher’s salaries and additional provisions for students would not be fully funded if prices for heating stay high. I was able to talk to teachers about the worry this is causing.</p>



<p>It is only right that any increases to staff pay are properly covered by increased investment into schools and it is important that the Government has contingency plans and funding in place to reassure schools that they will be supported should energy bills stay high.</p>



<p><strong><u>Windows for Ukraine:</u></strong></p>



<p>I also took part in a visit to CPR Manufacturing in Alfreton, who are supporting a project called Windows for Ukraine. Cromwell Polythene is manufacturing polyethylene film used to make effective temporary windows as part of a project called Insulate Ukraine. The company have donated some of the film being used, which is an alternative to glass and insulates homes better than double-glazing. The local business usually manufactures bin liner products.</p>



<p><strong><u>Collis engineering visit &amp; 5G masts:</u></strong></p>



<p>To look at their new 5G masts I&#8217;ve also been to see Collis Engineering Ltd. They&#8217;re manufacturing a new mast and tower system to support the rollout of 5G and which has a high headload capacity, meaning several operators can share the same structure and system. Collis are an important local employer and it was good to learn more about this innovation that is being manufactured right here in the heart of Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that access to telephone and broadband signal remains an issue for many residents, so hopefully this innovation will help with that, and I&#8217;ll continue to pursue solutions for areas where there are concerns or problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I visited Kings Heath Boys School last week which has just had a fine Ofsted report reflecting real progress achieved under four years of the current Head’s leadership.</p>



<p>It’s only by providing good schools that we can equip our children and grandchildren for the future. There’s always been a link between poor areas and school success. Labour understands this. In the 60s and 70s the Wilson government created Educational Priority Areas and after 18 years of Tory rule, the last Labour government introduced Education Action Zones to once again boost the chances of children from poorer backgrounds.</p>



<p>It’s by working with parents and carers and putting schools at the centre of communities that we build the solid foundations from which children succeed. Over 13 years of Tory rule, we’ve seen teachers abused and experts ridiculed and an attempt to return schools to teaching models experienced by too many government ministers, in private schools, over the past 50 years. It’s not structures like free schools or academisation or gimmicks about a smattering of Latin that matter. We need support for parents and programmes to attract the best teachers to disadvantaged areas.</p>



<p>Almost every successful person has a story about the teacher who influenced their direction and put them on a path to success. We need to rediscover an ambition and love for education.</p>



<p>At Kings Heath Boys they’re not planning to rest on their laurels but open up choice and opportunity by changing to an intake of boys and girls. We’re blessed with several outstanding schools in south Birmingham, they do a remarkable job despite squeezed budgets, teacher retention problems and children’s mental health issues. These are all things the government should be addressing.</p>



<p>I hope the local community will get behind plans for Kings Heath Boys which will give more children a chance to attend a school that’s best for them. I’m hungry for a Labour government that treats teachers with the respect they deserve and puts our children first.</p>



<p>It’s time to focus on a system where the talents of every child can be nurtured and where their achievements are the priority.</p>

<p>As he hadn&#8217;t commissioned this company in the first place, he demanded to see the application form, which was such a poor forgery that both his and his wife&#8217;s signature were clearly in the same handwriting.</p>



<p>With the government repeatedly warning the public not to fall for financial scams, it&#8217;s incredible that the HMRC fell for this one.</p>



<p>So can we have a Treasury statement, so we can understand the extent of this problem, what&#8217;s being done to prevent it in the future, and when constituents like mine will actually get their money from the HMRC.</p>



<p><strong>Government response</strong>:<br>Well, I thank the Honourable Lady for raising this case. I&#8217;m very sorry to hear that. </p>



<p>She may of course wish to raise it at Treasury questions on the 9th of May.</p>



<p>But given this is a sizable chunk of money for them to be out of pocket with, I will certainly raise this today with HMRC and ask them to contact the Honourable Lady with regard to this case.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>The cross party Work and Pensions Select Committee responsible for scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) policies, has published a damning report on the Government’s health assessments system which is used to screen whether sick and disabled people should have access to vital social security payments.</p>
<p>These payments provide financial support to a working age person who is unable to work because of their health condition or disability; the assessment for this is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) and is for either Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work. In addition there is also the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment process to access support to cover the extra costs disabled people face because of their disability which are estimated at over £580 a month on average; this is for the Personal Independence Payment.</p>
<p>The report exposed the detrimental impact of the assessment process itself on the health and well being of claimants.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the Committee, Professor Ben Barr, from the University of Liverpool, was asked about research he carried out in 2015 which looked at the impacts of the WCA as claimants were reassessed to move onto Employment Support Allowance. His analysis estimated that across England, the WCA had caused an additional 600 suicides, 300,000 additional cases of mental health problems and a large rise in the prescribing of antidepressants over a nine-year period.</p>
<p>&#8220;We looked at whether it could be explained by other factors or other economic trends, but there was quite a unique pattern in the increase in mental health problems, and the most likely explanation was that it was due to the reassessment process&#8221;, he told the committee. He said it is difficult to assess improvements since this study as &#8220;there are no systems in place&#8221; to monitor the impact of the health assessments and the potential adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>A survey by the University of Kent last year found half of claimants who have been through the WCA process said it made their mental health worse. Dr Ben Baumberg Geiger, who led the research, told the committee: &#8220;It is not sufficient to say that this is a historical problem and that everything is fine now. If there was more transparency, it would be easier to know a bit more about it, but the evidence suggests that there are still major problems with the WCA that could lead to an increased risk of poor mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Debbie Abrahams the Member of Parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth and a Member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee said:</p>
<p><em>“The evidence is clear &#8211; the current system is not fit for purpose. The DWP’s own figures show that <strong><u>274 people a month</u></strong> <strong><u>die 6 months after being found fit for work </u></strong>and <strong><u>60 people a month die 3 months after having PIP refused. </u></strong>These are poorly people not the shirkers and scroungers that some Conservatives refer to when discussing social security claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“We heard evidence during the inquiry that when people were being reassessed between 2010 and 2013, there were 600 additional suicides. In 2020, National Audit Office has said that the claimant deaths that the DWP had investigated were the tip of the iceberg. The current approach is contributing, directly and indirectly, to the physical and mental health harm of claimants. </em></p>
<p><em>“Last year the Equality Watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, issued a Section 23 order against the Department of Work and Pensions over their discriminatory treatment of disabled claimants.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Government itself has effectively acknowledged a different approach is needed when they announced that they would abolition the Work Capability Assessments, something I have been calling for years, but the detail of the future process is too opaque and doesn’t provide reassurance. Given it will take place several years to replace, what happens until then?</em></p>
<p><em>“I remain deeply concerned about these health assessments but also about the punitive nature of the sanctions regime, introduced in 2012 and, once again, on the rise. </em></p>
<p><em>“I believe it is these social security policies, as well as the inadequacy of the social security support especially for working age people, and the dehumanising culture that claimants too often experience that collectively contribute to the adverse health effects is the It is so detrimental to vulnerable people especially, but to all people as well.</em></p>
<p><em>“Given the failure of the Government to make many of the changes recommended in our predecessor Committee in 2018, I hold little hope in them taking on board the improvements set out in the report.”</em></p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update on a few local matters.</p>
<p>First of all, for those of you intending to vote in the local elections in May, a reminder if you did not know, that you will need to take photo ID with you to the polling station. This is part of a new approach to avoid people impersonating someone else by voting in their name.</p>
<p>There are details on Council websites for Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead and what to do if you do not have a suitable form of ID.</p>

<h2>Stoneleigh Railway Crossing</h2>
<p>For those of you living in the Stoneleigh area, work is due to start soon on the new step free crossing over the railway at the station. I hope this will make things much easier for people with mobility issues, not to mention small children in buggies or heavy shopping bags.</p>
<p>This is a timetable for the planned work.</p>

<h2>One Day Travel Cards</h2>
<p>Transport for London has just announced that it is planning to scrap paper one day travelcards from outside London, which is likely to affect many people in our area. I will be lodging an objection to this, particularly as it is happening at the same time as the proposed ULEZ. If you want to find out more, they have published details at</p>

<p>Although the feedback form on this site is pretty limited, I would encourage you to share any opinions about the proposal via the link.</p>
<h2>Veterans Group</h2>
<p>In the last bulletin I gave you details of the support for veterans in Epsom and Ewell. I have been asked to remind those living in Mole Valley about the veterans hub for those living in the district, which is also providing valuable support locally. You can find out all the details at</p>

<p>The famous black door of Number Ten Downing Street was the backdrop this week for a visit from Boston and Skegness sixth formers. The students, who in November had participated in the inaugural William Waynflete debate competition organised by Matt Warman MP, enjoyed a tour of the Houses of Parliament before their visit to Number Ten. The day was rounded off by a Q&amp;A session with Matt and the competition judges as well as guests from Parliament including House of Commons Library Director of Research Edward Wood. The panel passed on their careers advice as well as explaining some of the opportunities available in politics besides being an MP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking after the visit <strong>Matt Warman MP commented</strong> ‘I was keen to establish a debating competition to encourage students to think deeply about some of the issues facing our society and, crucially, to equip them with the skills to consider both sides of a complex argument. Today’s visit to the home of modern democracy was an excellent opportunity to see those skills in action with students having the chance to observe opposition MPs challenging Ministers at the despatch box. I look forward to next year’s programme and on a broader note, am always happy to welcome schools in my constituency to Parliament.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chair of Governors at Boston High School Lisa Smith</strong> who accompanied the visit said ‘This was a wonderful opportunity for our students to see democracy in action – and to be inspired by the opportunities for careers in parliament. We are grateful to Matt for arranging the debate competition and the visit and look forward to defending our winner’s trophy next year!’</p>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world&#8217;s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<br />
Pay-outs of up to £31,000 will be made, with an average payment of £15,000.<br />
<br />
The scheme will be delivered within Labour's first full five year term of government.<br />
<br />
Payments will go to women born in the 1950s who had their state pension age hiked.<br />
<br />
David Cameron's coalition government presided over a change in the law that increased the women's state pension age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.<br />
<br />
Labour will introduce a compensation scheme as rapidly as possible for the 3.7million women hit by the changes, which Cameron's Tory-Lib Dem government imposed in 2011.<br />
<br />
It comes after Boris Johnson u-turned on his pledge to help those affected.<br />
<br />
He dismissed the concerns of a woman who has lost out on her pension, telling her it’s “not possible” to right the huge wrong she and so many others have suffered.<br />
<br />
The next Labour government will compensate women who were unfairly hit by the rise in the state pension age and give them the respect they deserve.<br />
<br />
They were not able to prepare and have had to suffer serious financial consequences as a result.<br />
<br />
We have a historic debt of honour to them.<br />

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />

</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br />
<br />
I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br />
<br />
What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br />
<br />
Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br />
<br />
<i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br />
<br />
The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br />
<br />
They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br />
<br />
The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br />
