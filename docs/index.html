            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Devolution has provided the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland the opportunity to vary the response to the virus in their areas of the UK. Today I would be interested in your comments on how you think the different administrations have fared, and what if anything devolved power has brought to help us in this crisis.</p>



<p>If we start with the data we see that all four parts of the UK have suffered badly. Each had a bad attack in the spring, and each has seen a further flare up in the late autumn after a summer lull. The Scottish government&#8217;s slightly tougher approach earlier in the year was designed to eliminate the virus, but it did not do so. Wales taking a modestly tougher approach has ended up with the worst figures for cases and deaths. </p>



<p>Latest figures 17.12.20  from inception of pandemic</p>



<p>Cases by area per 100,000 people</p>



<p>Wales  3633</p>



<p>Northern Ireland   3183</p>



<p>England   2957</p>



<p>Scotland   2000</p>



<p>Certified deaths involving CV 19 per 100,000</p>



<p>Wales 123       (0.123%)</p>



<p>England 115.6    (0.115%)</p>



<p>Scotland  107.4   (0.107%)</p>



<p>Northern Ireland   78.2    (0.078%)</p>



<p>We also see that  despite plenty of different rhetoric and some criticism of the UK/English approach by both Scotland and Wales, the policies followed throughout the UK have been remarkably similar. There have been minor differences played up by spinners over the timing and length of some lock down moves, and over the numbers of contacts or hours of opening permitted. These do not seem to have made much difference. The Welsh short circuit breaker was followed by a further surge and more extensive lockdowns. Rural areas seem to fare better than more densely populated urban areas. </p>



<p>There has been no devolved challenge to the general academic and policy framework provided by UK experts, and no attempt to define a  very distinctive course to see if a different approach works better. The experts of the devolved administrations seem to have very similar views to the UK national experts. </p>



<p>The First Minister of Scotland has used the crisis to give herself a much greater media exposure on UK as well as Scottish programmes, choosing to front run some of the common working of the UK and devolved governments before the daily UK news conferences which have characterised a lot of this period. She has wanted to argue there is a distinctively Scottish approach which is better, but has found this more difficult to sustain as the Scottish numbers remain high and her country stays in lock downs. Each administration has had its share of embarrassments, with experts and advisers breaking their own rules and now Wales discovering a lot of lost data. </p>



<p>I think the overall results have been disappointing. I would have liked to have seen more collaboration from the devolved governments. Alternatively it would have been good to see  more intelligent challenge and experiment with a different way of responding so we could learn from the differing approaches, By nature this is an experimental period faced with a new disease where  no-one started with the answers. The main breakthrough that can save all the administrations is the vaccine invention by US companies so far, coupled with the foresight of the UK government to licence it quickly and order it in big quantities. No administration has made Test and Trace work well. None has tried isolation hospitals nor used much extra capacity created by the Nightingales.  Let us hope UK science soon lands its own vaccines and treatments. UK scientists and medics  are to be congratulated on discovering that steroids can cut the death rate from the disease and on their progress with other treatments. </p>

<h1>Dear Newcastle December  2020</h1>
<p>I suspect there are few Newcastle Central constituents who are not looking forward to the end of 2020. This has been the strangest year, and the hardest for many. Whether you have lost a loved one to Covid, or suffered the stress and responsibility of working on the frontline, been furloughed or, worse, made redundant, or had to close your business, or have had your studies interrupted or have simply missed the contact with friends, family and other human beings, this year has challenged so many of us on so many levels. As we end a second lockdown in Tier 3 and look forward to a Christmas holiday with limited contact, we all hope that 2021  will be better, and indeed the vaccine does offer the hope     of a return to normality, even, we can hope, a better normality!</p>
<p>But for the moment we must follow the public health measures in place and right now that means Tier 3, with the relaxation of rules for Christmas. We have already made huge sacrifices, with a significant improvement in our coronavirus infection rates from a peak of almost 450 per 100k mid November to just over 100 8<sup>th</sup> December.  That is very welcome and is now below the national average, which did lead us to hope that we might be placed in Tier 2. However we  must recognise the continued risks of transmission and protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the NHS.</p>
<p>And in return we have a right to expect the support from Government to enable businesses and communities to get through this crisis. Unfortunately that is not the case. Businesses are constantly contacting me to tell me what they are going through and some of the stories are  heart-rending. A number said they did not see how they could make it through January.  These are local businesses and local jobs. We must persuade Government to provide local support for businesses, and for our communities and the services we all depend on.</p>

<p>As well as Covid, we face the end of the Brexit transition period without, for the moment, a deal. This continued uncertainty is hard on business and people who have so many other challenges to face.</p>
<p>But Christmas is a time for hope and I do hope that everyone finds time to relax, in a covid secure way, with friends and family.</p>

<p><strong>Newcastle Central Team Christmas Lunch</strong></p>
<h1>Backbench and Constituency Role</h1>
<ul>
<li>The office continues to work successfully remotely whilst seeking to improve working practices to make it easier and more effective for constituents.</li>
<li>My Covid Communication went out to constituents to set out the ways in which I can provide support during the crisis, what other sources of help are available, and explain how my surgeries and constituency engagement have changed to be Covid secure</li>
<li>I continue to engage with the Prime Minister, Ministers, Government Agencies and others regarding the data that is driving decision-making in placing Newcastle in Tier 3, enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions, availability of testing data and resourced to local authorities, financial support for individuals and businesses facing ongoing COVID-19 disruption and restrictions in the North-East, calling for increased transparency in football governance, raising questions surrounding Newcastle United’s failed takeover, forward planning for next summer’s exams, health and safety precautions for health and safety of Royal Mail staff and the Horizon scandal.</li>
<li>I presented a petition against police brutality in Nigeria on behalf of Tyne and Wear Nigerian Association</li>
<li>For Small Business Saturday I visited, at a social distance, many brilliant small businesses across the constituency.</li>
<li>I raised the terrible rise in child poverty in the North East with the Prime Minister, but he refused to acknowledge it.</li>
<li>I have put down a number of parliamentary questions to shed light on the role of the Foreign Office in the Newcastle United failed takeover.</li>
<li>
<h1>Shadow Ministerial and PES Role</h1>
<ul>
<li>I led for Labour on the National Security and Investment Bill as it went through its committee stage. The Bill enables Government to intervene in mergers and acquisitions on the basis of National Security, something Labour has been calling for for some years now.  However the Bill does not go far enough and in particular, does not offer enough support for small businesses who may be impacted, or enable the scrutiny of the Intelligence and Security Committee.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At FAB Bakery on small business Saturday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are drafting the report for our Digital Future consultation.</li>
<li>We are continuing to meet with key stakeholders for the different briefs</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be leading for Labour on the  Telecoms Security Bill  as it goes through its  committee stage. The Bill covers the removal of Huawei from our 5G network and the diversification of our telecoms infrastructure. However it does not do enough to ensure the long term security and resilience of our essential telecoms infrastructure, or develop a UK sovereign capability in telecoms network provision.</p>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Worcester MP, Robin Walker, has welcomed the Government’s announcement that Worcestershire County Council will see its budget boosted by 5.3 per cent next year, as part of the Conservatives’ commitment to level up local services across the country and give them the resources they need to support their communities as we recover from the pandemic.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Local authorities in England, including Worcestershire County Council, will receive a share of £51.2 billion local government funding next year – up £2.2 billion on this year. Funding for key public services will again be protected, with significant extra resources dedicated to areas where they are needed most. Thanks to the investment being made by the Conservatives, Worcestershire will have an extra £20.27 million to spend next year.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The local government finance settlement sets out how much councils have to spend vital local services each year, including social care which will see a £1 billion increase in funding next year as a result of the announcement. In total, local authorities across England will receive an extra £5 billion in support next year, including a further £1.55 billion in additional grant funding to cover costs relating to the pandemic and an extra £670 million to help families facing hardship with their council tax bills.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is on top of the more than £7.2 billion in additional funding given to local areas throughout the pandemic so far to protect vital services that have kept vulnerable people and communities safe.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Commenting, Robin said:  </b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Local authorities play a vital role in our communities, providing the crucial local services that people rely on every day. Worcester residents will benefit as their county council will have an additional £20 million in funding this year thanks to the Government. These funds will help our local leaders make positive change in the area.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“This builds on the significant funding boost the council received at the beginning of the year, underlying our determination to ensure all local authorities have the resources they need to drive forward our recovery in a way that works for our community as we build back better after the pandemic.”</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Commenting, Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said:  </b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Councils have played a critical role leading their communities during the pandemic and delivering vital local services to vulnerable people and we have supported them with £7.2 billion extra funding to date.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“That’s why I am announcing a financial package that will provide over £5 billion of extra support next year. This will give councils the resources they need to lead the recovery of their communities while delivering the services that people rely on.”</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Thanks to measures introduced by the Conservatives, taxpayers in Worcester now have a stronger voice over council tax rises than ever before.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This means local residents have the power to veto excessive council tax rises, with a referendum being required if councils propose raising the tax by 2% or more; Councils with responsibility for adult social care will be able to set a further 3% increase, ring-fenced exclusively for adult social care. Anything above this level will also need to be voted on by local people. This strikes the right balance between addressing pressure on services and giving council-tax payers the final say on excessive increases.</p>

<p>2020 has left us with many legacies as we’ve coped with a set of circumstances none of us would have imagined. As we look to the light provided by new vaccines and as we approach a new year, there is yet another nasty legacy sting in the tail of 2020 – a rise in feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p>Research from Age UK has shown that this Christmas is set to be the loneliest yet for older people. Over 160,000 people over the age of 65 will suffer from feeling lonely this festive season, with nearly 60% of them fearing that they won’t see any family and friends. Those are heartbreaking numbers, even one person feeling like this is one too many.</p>
<p>Our communities can carry another more positive legacy from 2020. The Age UK research also highlighted that over 100,000 older people were helped to get through the pandemic by the kindness of strangers. The simple act of checking on people made a life-enhancing difference for so many, we can never know for sure, but it’s probably safe to assume that in some instances, it was life-saving.</p>
<p>Of course, loneliness and isolation don’t discriminate; young people are also affected. The Office of National statistics were able to point out that, during the first month of the pandemic, 7. 4 million people, across the nations of the UK said that their wellbeing was affected through feeling isolated.</p>
<p>We all knew that these restrictions were essential to protect lives, but the collateral effect was, as predicted, substantial. Recently, we have become more aware of a problem that has existed for some time but rarely brought into public debate. Work undertaken for the charities MIND and Mental Health UK confirmed that young people are particularly affected by loneliness.</p>
<p>During the pandemic almost half of 18-24-year-olds experienced, and those aged 25-34 are twice – yes twice – as likely to be lonely at Christmas than older people. That’s a lot of lonely people out there feeling isolated.</p>
<p>While we cannot visit indoors, there are many other ways we can help people feel less isolated. Given that a third of people are too embarrassed to admit that they are lonely, it is small acts that make a difference; it might be a note through the door or a phone call to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. Simple offers of contact, help with shopping, a chat a few steps back from the doorstep could mean a big deal to reassure folk that they are valued and to feel a little less alone.</p>

<p class="xmsonormal">Over half of all bus journeys in England take place within just one city. It won’t surprise you to know that the city in question is London, but that statistic is still shocking. In 2018/19, 2.2 billion bus journeys were made in the capital compared to 2.12 billion in the whole of the rest of the country. And each year the gap in bus use between London and the rest of England grows. Over the past decade, bus use in London has decreased by just 1.4%, whilst elsewhere it has shrunk by an incredible 11.4%.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">There are, of course, many reasons for this imbalance between London and the rest of the country, but they are all linked. The fact is that London has the best bus system in the country – the buses are cheaper, more frequent, there are more routes and they are integrated with other public transport. That London has better buses is no accident. It all comes back to Margaret Thatcher’s Tory Government in the 80s, which deregulated buses everywhere in England… other than London.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">I’ve written about how immensely damaging this deregulation has been for Greater Manchester previously. Our buses are far too expensive (all bus journeys in London are just £1.50, including unlimited changes within 90 minutes), too irregular and we have to fight to keep vital routes running as some private operators focus on profit over service.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Unfortunately, this deregulation has created something of a vicious circle. The worse our bus services become, the fewer people use them, which leads them to get even worse and even fewer people to use them, and so on and so on. We need to break this cycle.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Luckily, our Metro Mayor Andy Burnham gets this and wants major reform of our buses, bringing them under local control. There is a consultation on the proposals for a new franchising system and I’d encourage you to take part at<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.gmconsult.org/">www.gmconsult.org</a><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>before the 29 January deadline.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">
<p class="xmsonormal">Buses are a vital lifeline for those without access to private cars, but they should be much more than that. In the future for transport that I’d like to see, buses would be the preferred method of transport for local journeys by those both with and without cars. For this to become a reality though, we urgently need a better bus system where taking the bus is a cheap, convenient and pleasant experience. Thankfully, I think Greater Manchester is heading firmly in that direction.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>The last full week before Christmas is always a busy one in Parliament and the constituency and this year is no different. Firstly, this week saw me elected as Vice Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Archives and History. This is a really important APPG as it stands on a cross-party basis to push for the preservation of local history up and down the country. We all know the value of keeping our history alive and that means that we need all levels of government working together to preserve our archives for future generations. In these times of the COVID pandemic, one of the consequences is we are not having conversations with older members of the community and history is not being passed on to younger generations. I will be using my position as Vice Chair to push for decent funding for local history groups and increased awareness campaigns that show people the tremendous resources we have at our disposal to learn more.</p>
<p>As co-chair of the APPG Hairdressing, Barbering and Cosmetology I met virtually with the APPG officers to review our ongoing campaign to support those in this industry who have not received any help from the UK Government during the coronavirus pandemic, and plan the action we propose to take in 2021. We have written many letters to the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for BEIS, highlighting the plight of businesses and mobile practitioners, but the responses we have received make it clear that the UK Government has no respect for the many people employed in the hair and beauty industry who have contributed so much to the UK economy, £6 billion in the last year. We have been working with Keith Conniford, CEO and Registrar of the Hair Council, to secure a pledge from the UK Government to implement mandatory registration for the industry, which would have helped considerably in our campaign to obtain funding and grants for the dedicated members of this profession who have struggled to stay afloat during the past 9 months of the pandemic. But the UK Government are not interested.</p>
<p>Keeping our streets safe is so important to me and underpins everything I do in my role as your MP. That is why I attended a virtual meeting with the new Chief Constable of South Wales Police, Jeremy Vaughan, and Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael. I took this opportunity to welcome the new Chief Constable to his role and set out my aspirations for how community policing should be the bedrock of all activities undertaken by South Wales Police going forward.</p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to ask the Chief Constable to thank all the police officers in my constituency for all they do and wish them all the very best for 2021. We should not forget that our emergency responders will be working throughout this Christmas and New Year period. They will be keeping us safe, running towards danger and demonstrating all the values that make Neath such a special community. We should all be so grateful for the dedicated work they do.</p>
<p>I am also vice-Chair of the APPG on Gaps in Support, which exists to find solutions for those who have been excluded from UK Government support schemes during the Coronavirus pandemic. This cross-party group is currently gathering evidence to understand how people may have fallen through the gaps in support. We have been hearing from those whose lives and livelihoods have been negatively impacted and once we have collected all this evidence, we will be making our recommendations to the UK Government.</p>
<p>Our group has been extremely active over recent weeks, publishing our response to the Spending Review and the UK Government’s impact analysis into Covid-19. Being part of such an important All-Party Parliamentary Group ensures that we can have Neath’s voice heard at the highest levels of UK government.</p>
<p>The APPG Suicide and Self-Harm Prevention recently conducted an enquiry into support for young people who self-harm, and I joined in the follow up Zoom call meeting which looked at self-harm during Covid-19. We heard from experts who are gathering evidence, through research and surveys, which will form the basis of our recommendations to the UK Government. We listened to Professor Keith Hawton, Director of Oxford University Centre for Suicide Research and Consultant Psychiatrist at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust; Professor Nav Kapur, who leads the suicide work programme of National Confidential enquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness; and Dr Lynne Green, Chief Clinical Officer at Koothplc, one of the biggest providers of digital mental health in the UK with one of the world’s largest anonymised data sets. The Samaritans provide the secretariat for the APPG.</p>
<p>The Speaker of the House of Commons Lynsey Hoyle and the Lord Speaker Rt Hon the Lord Fowler held the first ever virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpyoJkAqLnw">Parliamentary Carol Service</a> from Westminster Hall. The Most Reverend the Rt Hon Justin Welby gave his Christmas sermon about the pain and suffering endured this year, that Christmas brings comfort and joy, out of the darkness will come light and hope with the roll out of the vaccine. There were many bible readings from religious representatives in Parliament. We heard carols from St. Martin’s Voices and the Soul Sanctuary Gospel Choir. The Speaker’s Chaplain, Reverend Tricia Hillis, said prayers.</p>
<p>The Dogs Trust is a charity that I have long supported. Their campaigns have been really important for protecting the safety and welfare of dogs both at home and abroad. Their puppy smuggling campaign was relaunched this year to raise awareness of the illegal dog trade across Europe.</p>
<p>I was delighted to join the Dogs Trust ‘Puppy Smuggling Taskforce’ to raise awareness of and tackle the abhorrent puppy smuggling trade. At a time when the demand for dogs in the UK has never been higher, I want to urge my constituents to really do their research before buying a puppy advertised for sale online.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon I chaired the concluding stage of one <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/04da0aba-f4d4-4811-8e69-38e8ab0529be">Westminster Hall debate</a> and the opening stage of the following debate. The first debate was about the future of Fairs and Showgrounds. Members discussed the lack of financial support for the many fairs and show-grounds that have had to close during the pandemic. The Minister responded with a long list of UK Government schemes set up by the Chancellor, which on the whole, members pointed out, were ineligible for showmen, who form part of the 3 million excluded. I found myself thinking about Donald Coleman, the former MP for Neath, who tragically and suddenly died in 1991. Donald was the only honorary member of the Showman’s Guild in Great Britain, and in my Maiden Speech, I told the story of Neath through the images contained in Donald’s stained glass window, which forms part of St Thomas’ Church.</p>
<p>The second debate was about UK Hydrogen Economy, which was secured by a backbencher who believed that the hydrogen economy will be transformative for the UK, enable decarbonisation across all sectors, achieving a net zero target, create skilled jobs and position the U.K. as a world leader. Members spoke about hydrogen transport, heating, gas network, renewable fuel, decarbonisation, green hydrogen and the Government’s Energy White Paper published on Tuesday which announced a £240 million hydrogen fund in its 10 point plan.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

    <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">In a letter to the Agriculture Secretary, George Eustice, the cross party group of Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative MPs call for farmers to be protected during the transition or else the "beautiful landscape of the UK will be damaged irrevocably."</span>

<p>Commenting Angus MacNeil said:</p>



<p>“It’s time to get the Scottish Government’s Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, HIAL, the Civil Aviation Authority, the trade union and other interested parties round the table.&nbsp; Discussions need to be held to find out exactly what is going on with the projected destruction and removal of jobs from the islands by HIAL, a Scottish Government agency.</p>



<p>“This issue is becoming very acute, causing a lot of anxiety to many people, therefore I am calling on interested parties and experts to get around the table to discuss this early in the New Year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HIAL employees cannot live with this uncertainty &#8211; the communities deserve better and need these jobs to be retained in the islands, we cannot have these jobs removed and government agencies recklessly damaging island communities.”</p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced policing will receive up to £15.8 billion in 2021-22 – an increase of £636 million on last year.</p>

<p>This includes over £400 million to recruit 20,000 extra police officers by 2023, delivering on the promise made by the Conservatives in last year’s General Election. West Mercia has already benefited from an additional 105 officers.</p>

<p>The funding will be also be used to bolster counter-terrorism policing, including money for armed policing and more officers.</p>

<p>The Conservative Government has been determined to support the police throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as officers have worked tirelessly to keep communities safe. The Government has provided £30 million to help forces step up coronavirus enforcement and has reimbursed forces for all additional PPE purchased between March and July.</p>

<p>Mr Dunne said:</p>

<p>“Officers and staff at West Mercia have been instrumental in keeping our community safe this year, and I pay tribute to them for their hard work and professionalism, particularly in this challenging year. I have engaged with Police leaders here in Shropshire throughout the pandemic, and commend local officers for the way in which they have applied their tact and good judgment to keep our community safe.</p>

<p>I am delighted to see West Mercia getting an additional £13m next year. I know the presence of additional officers on our streets has already helped reassure local residents. I look forward to speaking to our Police & Crime Commissioner, John Campion, to learn how he intends to deploy the extra resource in South Shropshire.”</p></div>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing with a further update on the coronavirus pandemic and to let you know that unfortunately our area has been moved into the highest Tier 3 of coronavirus restrictions. This decision has been taken because there has been a sharp increase in the number of infections locally and a big jump in the number of patients with Covid in our local hospitals.</p>
<p>This is where you can find the latest figures for infections in our area <a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/people-and-community/emergency-planning-and-community-safety/coronavirus/alert-levels-and-local-outbreak-plan/figures-and-statistics/daily-data"><strong>here</strong>.</a></p>
<p><strong>Tier 3 Rules</strong></p>
<p>These are the rules that apply in Tier 3 areas:</p>
<p>• you must not meet socially indoors or in most outdoor places with anybody you do not live with, or who is not in your support bubble, this includes in any private garden or at most outdoor venues<br />
• you must not socialise in a group of more than 6 in some other outdoor public spaces, including parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, a public garden, grounds of a heritage site or castle, or a sports facility – this is called the ‘rule of 6’<br />
• hospitality settings, such as bars (including shisha venues), pubs, cafes and restaurants are closed – they are permitted to continue sales by takeaway, click-and-collect, drive-through or delivery services.<br />
• accommodation such as hotels, B&amp;Bs, campsites, and guest houses must close. There are several exemptions, such as for those who use these venues as their main residence, and those requiring the venues where it is reasonably necessary for work or education and training<br />
• indoor entertainment and tourist venues must close.</p>
<p>This includes:<br />
• indoor play centres and areas, including trampolining parks and soft play<br />
• casinos<br />
• bingo halls<br />
• bowling alleys<br />
• skating rinks<br />
• amusement arcades and adult gaming centres<br />
• laser quests and escape rooms<br />
• cinemas, theatres and concert halls<br />
• snooker halls<br />
• indoor attractions at mostly outdoor entertainment venues must also close (indoor shops, through-ways and public toilets at such attractions can remain open). This includes indoor attractions within:<br />
• zoos, safari parks, and wildlife reserves<br />
• aquariums, visitor attractions at farms, and other animal attractions<br />
• model villages<br />
• museums, galleries and sculpture parks<br />
• botanical gardens, biomes or greenhouses<br />
• theme parks, circuses, fairgrounds and funfairs<br />
• visitor attractions at film studios, heritage sites such as castles and stately homes<br />
• landmarks including observation decks and viewing platforms<br />
• leisure and sports facilities may continue to stay open, but group exercise classes (including fitness and dance) should not go ahead.<br />
• there should be no public attendance at spectator sport or indoor performances and large business events should not be taking place. Elite sport events may continue to take place without spectators<br />
• large outdoor events (performances and shows) should not take place, with the exception of drive-in events<br />
• places of worship remain open, but you must not attend with or socialise with anyone outside of your household or support bubble while you are there, unless a legal exemption applies<br />
• weddings and funerals can go ahead with restrictions on the number of attendees – 15 people can attend wedding ceremonies, wedding receptions are not allowed, 30 people can attend funeral ceremonies, 15 people can attend linked commemorative events<br />
• organised outdoor sport, and physical activity and exercise classes can continue, however higher-risk contact activity should not take place<br />
• organised indoor sport, physical activity and exercise classes cannot take place indoors. There are exceptions for indoor disability sport, sport for educational purposes and supervised sport and physical activity for under-18s<br />
• you can continue to travel to venues or amenities which are open, but should aim to reduce the number of journeys you make where possible<br />
• avoid travelling outside of your area, including for overnight stays other than where necessary, such as for work, education, youth services, to receive medical treatment, or because of caring responsibilities. You can travel through other areas as part of a longer journey<br />
• for international travel see the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office travel advice for your destination and the travel corridors list</p>
<p>There are more details <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tier-3-very-high-alert">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Exemptions </strong></p>
<p>There are some exemptions from these conditions, which do not apply:</p>
<p>• to a single household, or a support bubble<br />
• for work or providing voluntary or charitable services, including in other people’s homes<br />
• for childcare, education or training – meaning education and training provided as part of a formal curriculum<br />
• for supervised activities provided for children, including wraparound care (before and after-school childcare), groups and activities for under 18s, and children’s playgroups<br />
• for formal support groups, and parent and child groups – up to 15 people aged 5 and older<br />
• to allow contact between birth parents and children in care, as well as between siblings in care<br />
• for arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardians<br />
• for prospective adopting parents to meet a child or children who may be placed with them<br />
• for birth partners<br />
• to attend a funeral – with no more than 30 people present – or a commemorative event such as a wake for someone who has died – with no more than 15 people present<br />
• to see someone who is terminally ill or at the end of life<br />
• to attend a wedding or civil partnership – with no more than 15 people present<br />
• to provide emergency assistance<br />
• to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm<br />
• to fulfil a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury service<br />
• to provide care or assistance to someone vulnerable or to provide respite for a carer<br />
• to facilitate moving home</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Bubbles</strong></p>
<p>Many people will still be uncertain what to do over Christmas. While people are still free to get together with family or friends for Christmas in a bubble of up to three households, for a five day period from the 23rd to the 27th of December, everyone is being asked to take great care. The virus is spreading fast at the moment, and although the vaccination programme has now started, it will take some time before all vulnerable groups have had the jab. So the message is to take great care and avoid taking any steps which might risk infecting an elderly relative in particular.</p>
<p>The full guidance is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-a-christmas-bubble-with-friends-and-family/making-a-christmas-bubble-with-friends-and-family">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination Process</strong></p>
<p>A few people have asked me about how the vaccination process will work. There is a set programme of vaccinations, and it is being done primarily by age group.</p>
<p>This is the latest information about the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/">programme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom Choral Society</strong></p>
<p>The Epsom Choral Society has asked me to let you know that whilst it cannot do its usual Christmas concert this year, it will be streaming a concert live on Saturday 19th December at 5pm. Everyone is welcome to tune in. Details are at www.epsomchoral.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p>Finally I wanted to thank everyone locally who has helped out in our community in difficult times this year. It has been a really tough year for many people, but it has also been a time when people really have been turning out to look after neighbours and the vulnerable. It is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<div class="field field-name-field-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://joncruddas.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/jonxmas2.jpg?itok=cftmN4If" width="740" height="423" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">This year has been unlike any other in our lifetime, and very few of us will find ourselves sorry to see the back of 2020. As we approach an altogether different Christmas from what we are used to, I think it is important to say thank you and pay tribute to all those that have made great sacrifices to keep us safe throughout the year. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">For many this has been a year of sadness and loss, loss of loved ones and a feeling that our futures have been put at risk with the economy taking such hard knocks. There will be thousands of businesses that closed their doors for good during the pandemic and a full social and economic recovery will undoubtedly be a long process. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">However, there are positives to take from 2020. In this unprecedented year full of challenges and unpredictability we have also seen the very best of people. A community spirit that many thought lost in time has been rejuvenated with mutual aid and citizens alliance networks across Barking and Dagenham and Havering. Neighbours looking out for one another and protecting the most vulnerable in our society. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">There are genuine signs of hope appearing as we come to the end of this difficult period. Scientists around the world have worked successfully to produce vaccines, and with a global roll out round the corner normality does not seem too far away. That is why it is all the more important that we do not give a platform to ‘Covid deniers’ or give way to the voices of anti-vaxxers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Despite the uncertainty and subsequent economic challenges, Dagenham and Rainham has not been without success stories and is in a strong position to weather the storm. Just last month Barking and Dagenham announced their delivery partner for London’s largest film studio which will bring Hollywood investment to Dagenham East, and plans were approved earlier in the year to relocate London’s three historic markets to Dagenham Dock. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">As we move into 2021, I will continue working to support local people, businesses, and voluntary organisations throughout Dagenham and Rainham. I also plan to keep the pressure on central government and will continue campaigning for greater investment in public services, improved healthcare and opportunities for our young people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Finally, I want to extend warm wishes to families across Dagenham, Rainham, South Hornchurch and Elm Park this Christmas, and all the best for a happy and healthy new year. Whilst it looks like Covid guidance will be relaxed over the holiday period, I would still urge caution and encourage residents to behave in a responsible way that keeps all in our community safe.</p>

<p>The MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, has welcomed that Holderness Health in his constituency is one of the first GP practices to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination against Covid-19 to their most vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>The UK became the first country in the world to approve the vaccine on 2nd December, when the independent Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency gave it the go-ahead. The NHS is now in the process of delivering the largest programme of immunisation in the country’s history, and subsequently announced that Castle Hill Hospital would act as a vaccine hub to protect the most vulnerable patients and healthcare staff in the region.</p>
<p>Now, GP practices are being added to the list of sites approved to administer the vaccine, despite health bosses having to contend with the practicalities of storing and transporting the vaccine, which must be stored between -80°C and -60°C and given to patients within six hours of being thawed.</p>
<p>As a result, Holderness Health has been chosen as one of four local Covid-19 vaccination centres in Hull and the East Riding, with more practices joining on a phased basis over the course of the coming months. The first GP-led vaccinations were carried out at Holderness Health yesterday afternoon (14th December).</p>
<p>Patients over the age of 80 with the greatest clinical risk are being offered appointments first, with priority groups determined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination &amp; Immunisation. Eventually, mass vaccinations will be offered in sports venues and conference centres once further vaccine supplies become available.</p>
<p>Graham commented, “This is fantastic news for vulnerable constituents in Beverley and Holderness, who will be among the first to be offered this vaccination by their family GPs.</p>
<p>“I know Holderness Health have plenty of experience in delivering safe and effective vaccination programmes, as they do every year with the flu jab, so I have every confidence that they will rise to the challenge despite its scale and complexity.</p>
<p>“The public can really help with this by not contacting the surgery to ask for a jab, because eligible people will be proactively contacted by phone, letter, or the national booking system.”</p>
<p>For it to be effective, people are required to have two doses of the vaccine 3 weeks apart and the NHS is urging people to ensure that they book their jabs when contacted and are emphasising the importance of attending both appointments: Dr Craig Dobson, medical advisor to the East Riding CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) said, “The vaccine has been shown to be effective and it is fantastic news that in our local area we can start to vaccinate our more vulnerable residents, who need it most.</p>
<p>“If you are in one of the priority groups, I would urge that when your GP Practice contacts you, please make sure you book and attend your appointments when you arrange them.”</p>

<p>Artwork featuring the best entries to our Annual MP / MS Christmas Card Competition will be on display from tomorrow (Saturday, 12<sup>th</sup> December) in the St Elli Shopping Centre adding some much-needed cheer to the town during the festive period.</p>



<p>Shoppers will be able to see eye-catching designs from
youngsters across the Llanelli constituency including from pupils from Ysgol
Llannon, Swiss Valley Primary, Ysgol Y Castell, Ysgol Gymunedol Bancffosfelen,
Burry Port Primary and Ysgol Y Felin.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The centrepiece of the exhibition will be the winning designs
from Mia Emoka of Ysgol Llannon who won the Infants category and Megan-Lily
Killick who picked up the prize for the best Junior entry.</p>



<p>It has been a pleasure to see that even after all the
upheaval of the last few months, so many children taking part in the
competition and submitting colourful and optimistic entries.</p>



<p>2020 has been a tough year for many people but we hope that the display will bring a little bit of extra happiness to Llanelli not only to those whose work will feature on it but also to anyone who takes the time to pop along and appreciate the wonderful work of our local young people.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&nbsp;UK&nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’</p>

<p>Last week we were all delighted at the news that the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>I am therefore equally pleased that the vaccine has now arrived in the West Midlands and in the Borough of Walsall.</p>
<p>No one underestimates the extent of the challenge ahead of us to roll out the vaccine to the whole population, but we now have light at the end of the tunnel and a route map out of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It is important however to remember and recognise thought that whilst the vaccine is being rolled out it remains we must continue to follow the rules as a Tier 3 area and observe the basics of – Hands, Face and Space! It is incumbent upon us all to continue to play our part in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</strong></p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is encouraging all constituents to put safety first when shopping online for their Christmas presents this year.</p>
<p>With online marketplaces not bound by the same laws as traditional retailers, fake and dangerous electrical products are being sold to unknowing customers. Containing sub-standard or counterfeit parts, they present a serious risk of fire or electric shock.  In research conducted by Electrical Safety First, 14 out of 15 sampled products from third-party sellers failed basic safety tests.</p>
<p>Electrical Safety First are encouraging consumers to make sure you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller, to check packaging and the item carefully for tell-tale signs that the product is not genuine, and to check for safety certifications on labelling.</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth said: </strong></p>
<p>“With Covid restrictions still affecting everyday life, many constituents will be doing their Christmas shopping online this year.</p>
<p>“If you are planning on buying electrical goods please make sure that you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller. Avoid third-party sellers for electrical goods and if you are unsure at all when your product arrives, do not use it.</p>
<p>“I know it’s been a tough year and finances are tight, but it&#8217;s not worth risking fire and electrocution to save a few pounds”.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/12/04/bristol-south-mp-warns-constituents-about-electrical-safety-in-the-run-up-to-christmas/" target="_blank">Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday (Wed 2<sup>nd</sup> Dec) I was lucky enough to be drawn to ask a question during Prime Minister’s Question Time.</p>



<p>Seeing as it’s almost twelve months since Boris Johnson took the mantle of Prime Minister, I thought I’d remind him of this anniversary and challenge him on his record.</p>



<p>Just some of the ‘highlights’ of the Prime Minister’s tenure that I chose to remind him of were; 71,000 Covid-19 deaths, which tragically is the highest rate in Europe. We have seen our national debt balloon to two trillion pounds for first time ever, meaning we are now officially the worst performing economy in the G7. With just weeks to go, our Brexit negotiations are failing, and we face leaving the EU without a deal which would spell disaster for jobs and businesses. Finally, during the pandemic, the Government have given at least £1.5 billion of taxpayer’s money in contracts to Tory friends and donors and at the same time whipped his MPs to vote against feeding hungry children free school meals. It’s a record that any decent person should be ashamed of however, I asked the Prime Minister which of these achievements he was most proud of.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly the Prime Minister failed to answer my question, avoiding defending himself he dithered and blustered his was and attempted to criticise the Labour Party. During my time as an MP I have sat opposite three different Prime Ministers and whilst none have left with records to be proud of, we really have sunk to a new low with Boris Johnson.</p>

<p><strong>Question by John to the Chancellor and Minister for the Cabinet Office:</strong></p>



<p>With reference to the National Audit Office report on Government procurement during the covid-19 pandemic, published 18 November 2020, [I would like to ask] whether the same standard of due diligence checks was carried out on potential suppliers and contracts in the (a) high priority lane and (b) normal lane.</p>



<p><strong>Answer from Ministers:</strong></p>



<p>Being able to procure at speed has been critical in providing the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>We welcome the NAO report which recognises that the government ‘needed to procure with extreme urgency’ and ‘secured unprecedented volumes of essential supplies necessary to protect front-line workers’.</p>



<p>All contracts, including those designed to tackle coronavirus issues, must continue to achieve value for money for taxpayers, use good commercial judgement and the details of any awards made should be published as soon as possible in line with Government transparency guidelines.</p>



<p>Robust processes are in place for the award of government contracts. PPE offers were assessed using the same eight step process, including quality checks, price controls and other due diligence, no matter where the original referral came from. This eight step process has been published in the NAO’s report. For further details please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-government-procurement-following-this-weeks-nao-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on gov.uk.(opens in a new tab)</a></p>



<p>We are committed to transparency in public procurement. Details of central government contracts above £10,000 are published on Contracts Finder. We regret that some details have not been uploaded in a timely fashion. All will be published as soon as possible and significant information is already available online.</p>



<p>The forthcoming Green Paper on transforming the UK’s public procurement regulations will strengthen our longstanding and essential policies that are fundamental to public procurement including transparency, ensuring value for money and fair treatment of suppliers. As part of this, we will propose legislating to reinforce that contracting authorities would need to publish basic disclosure information, including the basis of award decisions.</p>



<p>We have always accepted that there are lessons to be learned from how we responded to this unprecedented global pandemic and the government is fully committed to doing so. We will address the NAO report’s recommendations in due course. As I stated in my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-11-12/debates/46D252DF-18D4-40EE-9AD5-0439F9106839/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-ED32E98C-15B1-4BEF-A267-47FB68033CDF" target="_blank">answer on 12 November (opens in a new tab)</a>, we are engaged in both internal and external audit to review how our procurements during this period have been conducted.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-heading-link-color-mariner-color">Responding to the answer from Government, John wrote on social media: &#8220;Got answers to my Questions on Government covid contracts. Good that all suppliers faced same quality checks no matter who recommended them, but publication backlog of contract details still needs fixing. Big post-brexit opportunity for faster, more digital &amp; transparent, less bureaucratic Government buying process so small firms can challenge big incumbents easily!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday (01/12/20), Parliament was presented with a simple, for or against, choice to vote on the renewed ‘Tier’ restrictions which have subsequently come into place this morning and the additional financial support package on offer to businesses, workers and households across Gateshead and the North East.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I wanted to take some time to explain my position on this matter and why I voted against the imposition of this package yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>At the outset, I absolutely agree with experts here in Gateshead and Nationally that we must prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout our communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>I also agree that the best way to do this is through limiting social interaction especially among meetings of multiple households.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The package of restrictions are not perfect, they appear to be ever more complicated and the allocation of tiers to different regions appears to be unequal at first glance, with areas in the North and North East subjected to greater levels of restrictions compared to other parts of the UK with similar or higher rates of incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>To this end, I have formally requested the Government publish the criteria used and set out some clarity on how regions will move between tiers while we await the rollout of a number of vaccine programmes.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The restrictions in place since the spring, closing large numbers of businesses across Gateshead and limiting the trade of so many others, have had an incredibly damaging impact on the lives and livelihoods and overall wellbeing of so many people.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government has a duty and the means to provide proper financial support to these businesses and their employees, and to this end, I firmly believe they have failed. While the initial business rate grant scheme and the furlough scheme seemed generous, many millions of people have been left without any support whatsoever and continue to be ignored 9 months on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>In addition, businesses in Gateshead which have either had to remain closed or have been once again forced to close – hospitality, fitness suites and retail particularly – alongside many self employed workers; have been left with meagre amounts of support, if any, as many businesses enter what would traditionally be their busiest trading period.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government appear to have prioritised funnelling billions of pounds of tax payer money into, sometimes selective, elements of the private sector to provide inadequate PPE and an ineffective test, track and trace system. Instead, they should be prioritising financial support for businesses, employees and families affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Failure to do so has not only had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of so many people, but it has had a detrimental impact on adherence to the restrictions. The Government must understand that many people can not work from home and do not have ready access to utilities and food, and many can not afford to withstand repeated periods of self isolation without proper financial support – Statutory Sick Pay is simply totally inadequate.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Notwithstanding the urgent need to restrict the spread of Covid-19, I voted against the motion yesterday evening, as I firmly believe the Government can and must do more to provide adequate financial support for every person and business affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have raised the inadequate financial support with the Government since the spring and will continue to do so until they meet their responsibility in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Now that the North East is officially subject to tier 3 restrictions, I would urge all residents to follow the rules closely, as this is the only way we can reduce the spread of the virus enough to move down the tier system. With our infection rates declining, because of everyone’s efforts and with positive news of vaccinations in the very near future, it is imperative that we all do whatever we can to further drive down the spread of Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I hope this sets out my view clearly, however, if you have any further questions please do contact my office.</span></p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>



<p>I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.</p>



<p>It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. </p>



<p>However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.</p>



<p>Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121<sup>st</sup>
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.</p>



<p>Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.</p>



<p>Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.</p>



<p>It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.</p>



<p>We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.</p>



<p>We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.</p>



<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely<br>Cllr David Mellen<br>Leader, Nottingham City Council</p>

<p>Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. </p>



<p>Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: </p>



<p>“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.</p>



<p>“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.</p>



<p>“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.</p>



<p>“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” </p>



<p>Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25<sup>th</sup> November. </p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>
