<p>Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah has secured a meeting between the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove and Wylam Brewery to discuss the impact of Brexit on their business.</p>
<p>Chi said “The European Union accounted for half of Wylam Breweries business in 2020 but since the Governments bungled EU trade deal Wylam’s beers have been left in ports or returned to them. The Official Government advice is for Wylam to set up a European office effectively moving josb from Newcastle to the EU!”</p>
<p>Mr Gove stated that he ‘absolutely will’ meet with Chi and Wylam Brewery and Chi is currently in touch with him to organise the meeting</p>
<p>Wylam Brewery responded saying “We thank Chi for raising this with the Secretary of State and await contact from him after his agreement to meet with us to discuss and understand the real issues independent businesses are facing post Brexit”</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is supporting the National Trust’s efforts to emulate Japan’s <em>Hanami</em> – the ancient tradition of viewing and celebrating blossom &#8211; with its #BlossomWatch campaign.</p>
<p>With this spring likely to be the most anticipated ever as the UK slowly emerges from lockdown, the National Trust and Andrew Gwynne are inviting people to share the joy and hope that the sight of blush-tinted blooms will bring to help lift spirits and enable everyone to celebrate nature together.</p>
<p>The conservation charity launched #BlossomWatch last year when the country had just entered lockdown.  Thousands of people captured and shared images of trees in bloom across social media platforms, which received four million views in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that time spent daily connecting with nature is vital to human wellbeing, so Gwynne is urging people to ‘turn social media pink, white and green’ over the coming weeks, to mark one of ‘nature’s greatest spectacles’.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the last year, many of us have spent more time than ever in our gardens and local green spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The blossom season is a beautiful time of year, and one that makes being outside and spending time in nature even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to see the best blossoms from Audenshaw, Denton, Dukinfield, Reddish and the Heatons all over social media!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The National Trust’s Head of Nature Conservation and Restoration Ecology, Ben McCarthy said: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Blossom in all its guises can bring a particular sense of joy as we emerge from winter.  Clocking these bursts of colour as they unfurl across our neighbourhoods as a signal of the start of spring is truly joyful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on millions across the country – many have found noticing nature a vital way of enhancing their wellbeing and have discovered the many benefits of spending time in nature and noticing its natural rhythms as the year unfolds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So we urge everyone to get outdoors, safely enjoy the blossom where they live, and share their experiences with others.”</p></blockquote>

<p>MV Pentalina should be trialled for use now rather than waiting to be possible relief in the winter period, says Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil has been in constant contact with Transport Scotland and Caledonian MacBrayne suggesting the use of the MV Pentalina to ease the strain on the ageing and limited fleet serving the Western Isles.</p>



<p>In response to his correspondence, Transport Scotland has now agreed to ask CalMac to look specifically at the feasibility of using this vessel on the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service network.</p>



<p>CalMac, in correspondence with Mr MacNeil, say they are currently undertaking the 2021/22 overhaul programme including the use of relief vessels with the aim of resolving some of the weather reliability concerns across the most exposed routes.</p>



<p>They say that the deployment of MV Pentalina for short term relief for Winter 2021/22 as well as 2022/23 will be discussed if operational challenges can be overcome.</p>



<p>The broader review for Winter 2022/23 will commence afterwards.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “It is good that Transport Scotland are moving to this position where MV Pentalina is being discussed and looked at.</p>



<p>“I think we now just need to know which ports it can go in and out of, which are the ports where there are little bits of learning to be done.</p>



<p>“It is best for this to be done in a non-pressurised situation. Maybe a trial soon for a week or two down the West Coast of Scotland visiting various ports might be useful and instructive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latest report from the National Audit Office shows how the Government&#8217;s years of failure to get a grip on the social care crisis has left thousands without the help they need. This highlights what we have known for a long while&nbsp;– that long-term reform for social care is needed as an urgent priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister promised to fix the crisis in social care on the steps of Downing Street in July 2019, but eighteen months later this plan is still nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;The Government must bring forward their plans for reforming social care, and ensure that these vital services get the support and resources they so desperately need.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2021/03/25/the-uks-migration-proposals/">The UK’s migration proposals</a></h2>
              <h3>John Redwood (Wokingham)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I reproduce below a letter sent by the Home Secretary to all MPs and peers, as I thought it best you read the government&#8217;s statement and respond to their proposals:</p>
<p><strong>New Plan for Immigration</strong></p>
<p>We have today published the New Plan for Immigration – our landmark programme to deliver the first comprehensive overhaul of the asylum system in decades.</p>
<p>UK asylum claims increased by 21% to almost 36,000 in 2019 – the highest number since the 2015/16 European ’migration crisis’. Small boat arrivals to the UK reached record levels with 8,500 illegal arrivals last year.</p>
<p>At the same time, our ability to remove individuals with no right to remain in the UK is being undermined by repeated legal claims designed to impede removal action, often strung out over a period of many years. The vast majority of last-minute claims designed to prevent removal are subsequently found by the courts to have no merit. Shockingly, there are around 45,000 failed asylum seekers who have not left the UK and over 10,000 Foreign National Offenders – and yet there were just 7,000 enforced returns in 2019.</p>
<p>All of this impacts our ability to help those in genuine need by taking up scarce resources and wasting valuable judicial capacity.</p>
<p>We have already reformed our legal immigration system by ending free movement and introducing a new points-based immigration system. This plan is the next step in taking back control of our borders by tackling illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Our New Plan for Immigration has three main objectives:</p>
<p>1. To increase the fairness and efficiency of our system so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum;<br />
2. To deter and prevent illegal entry into the UK, thereby breaking the business model of the criminal trafficking networks and protecting the lives of those that they endanger; and<br />
3. To remove more easily from the UK those with no right to be here.</p>
<p>At the heart of this plan is the principle of fairness. Access to the UK’s asylum system should be based on need, not on the ability to pay people smugglers.</p>
<p>For the first time, how someone enters the UK will impact on how their claim progresses and on their status in the UK if that claim is successful. As we clamp down on illegal immigration and abuse of the system, we will also streamline the asylum framework to prevent repeat claims which frustrate removal, including of dangerous Foreign National Offenders.</p>
<p>We will increase prison sentences for those illegally entering the UK, introduce life sentences for facilitation of illegal entry, give Border Force additional powers, strengthen age assessments and introduce a more robust statutory definition of “well-founded fear of persecution” for asylum purposes.</p>
<p>At the same time, we will enhance our reputation as Global Britain, strengthening our safe and legal routes for refugees and fixing historic anomalies in British Nationality law.</p>
<p>The proposals are fully compliant with our international obligations, including the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.</p>
<p>These reforms are explained in more detail in the policy statement, which we have published today. To inform the proposals set out and ensure we can deliver effective change across the system, we have also launched a public consultation and a wide-reaching engagement process. We will use this opportunity to listen to a wide range of views from stakeholders and sectors as well as members of the public, followed by legislation at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>You can find the policy statement and consultation portal at:<br />
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-plan-for-immigration">https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-plan-for-immigration</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your views on our New Plan for Immigration, and hope that you will strongly encourage your constituents to take part in the public consultation so that the voice of the public is heard.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>Philip Dunne MP has welcomed local confirmation that the coronavirus pandemic is easing pressure on the NHS in Shropshire, with news that the temporary Urgent Treatment Centre set up at Bridgnorth Hospital will be relocated back to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Urgent Treatment Centre at the PRH had been temporarily relocated last year to Bridgnorth Community Hospital’s Minor Injury Unit (MIU), as the county tackled the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the number of covid cases falling locally, alongside a reduction in the number of people needing treatment in Bridgnorth, the Urgent Treatment Centre will relocate back to the PRH. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The MIU at Bridgnorth can still treat are range of minor injuries such as bites, cuts and lacerations, foreign bodies in the eyes, nose and ears, fractures that require plaster only, minor burns and scalds, minor head injuries (with no loss of consciousness), soft tissue injuries such as sprains and bruises, and wound infections. People with major injuries and illnesses, such as head injuries and breathing difficulties should still attend A&E.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: “With the number of people in our acute hospitals with covid continuing to fall, local cases reducing, and the vaccination programme well underway, moving the Urgent Treatment Centre back to the PRH is a sign that we are getting through this pandemic. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We cannot be complacent, and new variants present a risk – but the return to some sense of normality is helped by removing these temporary measures set up to help the NHS deal with the worst of the pandemic. While I would like to see the hospital upgraded to an Urgent Treatment Centre  permanently, as previously hoped for, this is not going to happen for now, so I would like to thank all those in the NHS who have worked in the UTC while it was at Bridgnorth, and for the continued efforts of NHS staff and volunteers to keep us all healthy.”</span></span></span></p></div>

<p>Losing John Lewis in Sheffield deals another blow to retail workers who are among those who have been hit hardest by the pandemic. My heart goes out to the workers and their families whose livelihoods are at risk.</p>
<p>The store has been a cornerstone of the city’s retail offer for more than a century. I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them.</p>
<p>In challenging times, the people of Sheffield rally around each other and I know we will bounce back despite the challenges COVID throws at us.</p>
<p>It’s clear high streets need to adapt, and that’s why we’re taking unprecedented action to create jobs, help people retrain and revitalise our town and city centres. We want them to thrive in the long term, by making them more vibrant, greener and attractive – and to be places where people can live and visit, as well a shop.</p>
<p>This week, local leaders and I <a href="https://sheffieldcityregion.org.uk/mayor-and-leaders-approve-860m-new-deal-for-south-yorkshire/">approved a £860m stimulus</a> in South Yorkshire’s economy to start our recovery and renewal from COVID. This is a game changing investment in our region’s economy, which will very significantly benefit Sheffield. This includes £300m to transform our places and high streets.</p>
<p>I’m determined to ensure Sheffield and South Yorkshire comes through this.</p>

<p>South Lakes MP Tim Farron has warmly welcomed the news that the Government are set to close the loophole which allows owners of second homes from paying no council tax by falsely claiming they are holiday lets.</p>
<p>In an announcement yesterday, the Treasury said it will now be tightening the rules so that second homeowners have to prove they have let properties out for at least 140 days per year.</p>
<p>Tim has been regularly raising this issue in Parliament and has met with several housing ministers over the past two years to make the case for the loophole to be closed.</p>
<p>Tim said: <em>"I'm delighted that the Treasury have finally decided to close this crazy loophole and I want to pay tribute to everyone who has helped us campaign for this.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"This move is long overdue - I first raised this issue with Rishi Sunak in Parliament back when he was a junior housing minister - but it is very welcome all the same.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Excessive second home ownership has badly hit so many communities here in the Lakes and so this just needs to be the first step in tackling this problem.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I'll be keeping up the pressure for the UK government to follow the lead of the government in Wales in letting local councils significantly increase council tax on second homes."</em>

<p>Last week I was pleased to support the Government’s legislation which delivers on the Government’s central commitment to keep our communities safe by reforming the justice system so that we crack down on crime.</p>
<p>Some key new measures in the legislation will increase sentencing for child murderers and lead to tougher sentencing for sex offenders.</p>
<p>At the same time the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will also strengthen the law to help deal with Unauthorised Traveller Encampments.</p>
<p>Since I was first elected I have campaigned for the law to be changed to prevent repeated traveller incursions across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency so I wholeheartedly welcome these new protections for my constituents.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bristol’s All About Jobs &amp; Apprenticeships events day reminder from Bristol South MP</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Karin Smyth MP is reminding all constituents about the All About Jobs &amp; Apprenticeships series of events that she is organising with Bristol City Council, the City of Bristol College, and the DWP on Thursday this week (25 March) from 3pm until 6pm.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Three online webinars will provide information about finding jobs and apprenticeships, as well as offer career support and guidance during this difficult time. These events are ideal for job seekers, those looking to progress in their career, and students about to finish school or college.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There will be three sessions held:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">3.00pm – 4.00pm A focus on getting a job where a group of experts will discuss how to go about looking for a job, the help and support that is available to you in your job search, and the types of jobs that are waiting to be filled at the present time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">4.00pm – 5.00pm A focus on apprenticeships for people to learn more about finding apprenticeships and what they offer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">5.00pm – 6.00pm A focus on Health and Social Care will discuss how to pursue or progress a career in the health and social care sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Karin Smyth said:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“This year has been incredibly challenging for the labour market and so many people have struggled to find jobs and training during this difficult time.

This week we mark the anniversary of the first national COVID lockdown. It’s been a year like no other, which has affected all of our lives. Our first thoughts are with the people we have lost to the coronavirus. Nationally it has claimed the lives of 148,125 people, and in the Folkestone and Hythe district [&#8230;]

<p>Weston&#8217;s MP has responded to the protest by Extinction Rebellion and Labour over the policing Bill.</p>



<p>John said: &#8220;The question for Extinction Rebellion and the Labour Party is why they want to stop some really important changes that matter hugely to everybody else in and around Weston.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example, the bill gives our local police long-needed powers to deal with the illegal traveller encampments which we get every summer in local parks or the seafront.</p>



<p>&#8220;It increases sentences for people who attack emergency workers like ambulance crews or firefighters. It stops sexual predators in positions of trust like sports coaches from exploiting young girls and boys.</p>



<p>“Why on earth do Extinction Rebellion and the Labour Party want to stop these things? Everyone agrees we need to preserve the right for peaceful, democratic debate and&nbsp;protests, but they’re so intent on organising political demonstrations with roadblocks that bring towns and cities to a halt that they’ve forgotten the rest of us have families we want to keep safe, and communities which need essential services to work properly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m happy to work with them to make sure their right to&nbsp;protest&nbsp;is maintained, but they’ve got to realise in return that this bill fixes some really important problems that local people have been asking for, for ages.”</p>

This has the effect of increasing the number of unemployed claimants. In addition to this, as part of the government’s response to Coronavirus (COVID-19), a number of enhancements were introduced to Universal Credit.

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, has welcomed BT’s exciting ‘Adopt a Kiosk’ initiative and the opportunities it presents for giving the iconic red phone boxes a new lease of life.</p>
<p>Under this scheme, recognised local authorities such as District, Borough, Parish and Town Councils, along with registered charities, have the chance to purchase their own red telephone box from BT for just £1.</p>
<p>The reason for the scheme is that advances in mobile phone technology have left the notable old phone boxes underused. According to BT, over half of all red telephone boxes in the UK have been removed or disconnected.</p>
<p>Eleven kiosks are up for adoption in Beverley in Holderness, located in: Atwick; Lund; South Dalton; Holme-on-the-Wolds; Etton; Tickton; Keyingham; Aldbrough; Patrington; Sunk Island; and Roos.</p>
<p>Graham said “The old red phone box is a cultural icon, one of the few pieces of street furniture we got right in the 20th century. They are a wonderful part of our local landscape and, I think, look really great when they’re refurbished and put to a new use: they can be a mini library for the community, a little museum or, my favourite, house a public access defibrillator.”</p>
<p>As Chair of CADEY (Community Access Defibrillators for East Yorkshire) Graham looks forward to working with any community that is looking to use their old telephone box to host a defibrillator and save lives.</p>
<p>Roughly 30,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals every year, but currently only 3,000 people survive because of how important it is to get immediate, on-the-scene treatment. Every minute without treatment reduces someone’s chances of survival by approximately 10%. Graham added, “In my view, with their bright red appearance, along with their central location, these boxes are well-suited to housing a defib which can be used in minutes on someone in cardiac arrest and save a life; every second counts. “</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham has written to the Government’s Building Safety Minister pointing out the glaring omissions to their plans when it comes to protecting leaseholders from exorbitant fire safety costs. </p>
<p>While the Government asserts that they have told building owners and industry that they should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders, that is not what is happening to the hundreds of thousands of leaseholders who are being caught up in this crisis. </p>
<p>In her letter to Lord Greenhalgh, Ms Gill provides the clear example from her constituency of Hemisphere Apartments. The building has a number of fire safety issues that require urgent remedial work that is estimated to cost £13.8 million – roughly £40,000 per flat. Like the 100 other buildings in Birmingham, last year they applied to the Government’s Building Safety Fund but are yet to receive a penny of funding. </p>
<p>Citing comments from the developer of Hemisphere Apartments, Redrow plc, which noted that the company had set aside £20m to support “half a dozen or so legacy schemes” with cladding costs, Ms Gill wrote to them on behalf of her constituents to ask for support to get remedial works off the ground. </p>
<p> Redrow has responded to pleas for help for leaseholders saying “Redrow is not prepared to offer any financial support at this stage”, citing “the Secretary of State’s commitment to fund necessary fire safety works on high-rise buildings, and to recover the costs through levies and taxes on developers such as ourselves” as one of the reasons why they won’t help. </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston said, “This exchange shows exactly how leaseholders are caught between a rock and a hard place. </p>
<p>“Four years on from the Grenfell tragedy, the Government’s building safety plan is still failing to get remediation works off the ground, while leaseholders in my constituency are paying out hundreds of thousands of pounds in waking watch fees and skyrocketing insurance premiums while they wait. </p>
<p>“Today, there are votes in the House of Commons on amendments to the Fire Safety Bill which would protect leaseholders from having to pay to fix a crisis they didn’t create. It is crucial for leaseholders right across the UK that MPs stand up for what is right to protect the innocent leaseholders.” </p>

<p>Judith, alongside Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of the council and Tracy Brabin, candidate for West Yorkshire Mayor, has called for the Government to ensure there is a Northern Powerhouse Rail stop in the city centre.</p>



<p>Representing all three of Bradford&#8217;s Labour MPs, Judith said: &#8220;There is a world out there that would open up with an NPR stop here in Bradford city centre.</p>



<p>“It would increase our opportunities for job search, it would mean our businesses thrive.</p>



<p>“It’s a massive deal for Bradford, I can’t think of anything bigger at the moment.”</p>

			<p>As Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, I welcome Dame Julie Walters’ support in calling on the Government to deliver on its election promise to double funding for dementia research.</p>
<p>This comes as Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK reveals 94% of dementia researchers are very concerned progress is at risk due to fewer funding opportunities. While new polling from the charity has highlighted that UK adults think the pledge made during the 2019 election is important, very few believe government will follow through on its word.</p>
<p>This week the UK’s leading dementia research charity has revealed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over three quarters (77%) of the public believe the Government’s pledge to increase its funding for dementia research to over £160 million a year is either still important (59%) or more important (18%) since the coronavirus outbreak.</li>
<li>One in five people (18%) think it is even more important because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen people with dementia among the hardest hit.</li>
<li>Despite this, only 7% of people believe the Government will deliver on the promise made during the 2019 election.</li>
<li>Yet the charity says the funding is more critical than ever before, as a separate survey shows one in five researchers are considering leaving, or have already left, dementia research due to COVID-19 &#8211; while more than a third (34%) are considering leaving research altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am delighted to see Dame Julie pressing the Government to keep the promise it made to the public.  I wrote to the Prime Minister in November urging him to keep his promise on the dementia ‘moonshot’ and also to the Chancellor last month, ahead of the Budget.  Unfortunately neither have yet replied and I share the concern of those surveyed that the Government will break its promise.</p>
<p>Like many people, including Dame Julie, I have family experience of dementia – my mother had Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. I know just how important research is into understanding the condition and looking for treatments to prevent, slow, and ultimately cure diseases that cause dementia.</p>
<p>It’s been well over a year since the government pledged to boost dementia research, after this was included in the Conservative 2019 General Election manifesto. But with no indication that this funding is to be delivered, it’s time for action.</p>
<p>While it’s right that the response to the pandemic has had to take priority, dementia is not just the UK but the world’s greatest long-term health crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the lives of people affected by dementia and their carers have been devastated, with a staggering 34,000 people with dementia estimated to have died from coronavirus since March 2020. The search for life-changing dementia treatments has never been more critical.</p>
<p>Our life sciences sector both in academia and industry showed what we can do together in response to Covid-19. In the same way, I believe we can lead the world in finding cures for the diseases which cause dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Dame Julie Walters said: </strong></p>
<p>“As someone who witnessed the effects of dementia growing up, I am proud to be standing with the tens of thousands of people who are calling on government to deliver on its election promise to double investment into researching the condition. My grandmother had vascular dementia and she lived with us when we were kids. We didn’t really understand her symptoms, but we all loved her to bits. I still don’t know how my mother coped having to care for her and look after three young children.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that over half of us know someone affected by dementia, yet there are no treatments to slow, stop or prevent it. Far too many families are being forced to experience the pain dementia causes on a daily basis because of the lack of treatments and to put it simply, enough is enough.</p>
<p>“There is an urgent need for research to bring about life-changing treatments for people affected by dementia. With the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on those with the condition, the funding promised by government is more critical now than it ever has been and it’s clear the public agrees. I’d urge everyone to sign this petition, so we can make it clear to government that we will not let their promise be cast aside.”</p>

<p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It&#8217;s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

<p>Nottingham City Council has had to make over £271m of budget savings between 2010/11 and 2019/20, and during the current pandemic has had to deal with £25.9m unreimbursed Covid response costs and loss of income. We are having to take difficult decisions in this budget which includes £15.6m of savings.<br> <br>Proposals include some service changes, as well as a workforce reduction of 272 full-time equivalent posts – 109 of which have been held vacant. We will also be implementing the Government’s proposed 3% social care precept towards the rising costs of care services for elderly and vulnerable adults, which now accounts for over 35% of the council’s net budget.<br> <br>Over the last couple of months we have been listening to the feedback on draft budget proposals and will be making a few changes as a result. We will be:</p>



<ul><li>Scrapping the staffing reduction to the Missing Children’s Team.</li><li>Scrapping the proposed 30p charge for public toilets in the City.</li><li>Continuing the grants to arts and cultural venues with a much smaller 15% funding reduction rather than the 37% that had been considered.</li></ul>



<p>There are many proposals in today’s budget that we are bringing reluctantly. To avoid similar decisions in the future we need the Government to change course.  We will be using Full Council today to call on the Government to urgently address a number of issues which will be significant for the Council’s budget and financial stability over the coming years including:</p>



<ul><li>The need to bring forward the promised Green Paper on Adult Social Care with a funding model that does not rely on continued increases in Council tax</li><li>Services for vulnerable children where provider pricing nationally is spiralling – Nottingham City Council is facing an estimated additional cost pressure of more than £12m over the coming year&nbsp;</li><li>Further support for  businesses and employment services which will be</li></ul>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Important information about new High Speed (HS2) bridges at Saltley viaduct and the Aston Church Road&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I need your help putting forward views about two new bridges being built for HS2 <strong>at Saltley Viaduct and the Aston Church Road, as they will cut road links for a year, beginning in mid-2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Ultimately the new High Speed 2 rail line is a game changer for our area. A train journey to Manchester will take just 41 minutes and a trip to London will take 45 minutes.</p>



<p>This is expected to create jobs, jobs, jobs: thousands of new jobs around the new station at Birmingham International &#8211; and thousands more in the city centre &#8211; plus up to 3,600 jobs at the new business park I’ve fought for at the old LDV-Alstom site.</p>



<p>However, building the line will cause disruption not least because the bridges at Saltley Viaduct and Aston Church Road have to be raised.</p>



<p>A lot of work has already gone into replacement plans and timing of the construction.</p>



<p>You can fill in the consultation survey online by going to</p>

<p>Or if you don’t have the internet call the freephone number on 08081 434 434.</p>



<p>Don’t forget to check out the new HS2 Jobs Board https://www.hs2.org.uk/supply-chain-jobs</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve battled hard over five years in Parliament to make sure HS2 works for us. This is a big bit of new infrastructure for us and I’m anxious we get it right. So please make sure you have your say.</p>

<p>Grant Shapps MP yesterday attended the vaccination centre at the University of Hertfordshire College Lane Campus in Hatfield.</p>
<p>The centre caters for 4 different GP surgeries in Hatfield and currently vaccinates around 350 people per day. The centre is organised so that people are vaccinated by the staff from their own GP surgery.</p>
<p>Mr Shapps becomes the first cabinet minister to have received a jab for the coronavirus, having had treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma 21 years ago.</p>
<p>On arrival, Mr Shapps took a lateral flow test to make sure he was not bringing COVID into the vaccination centre. He spoke to volunteers and staff outside the centre before entering to have his first dose, and tour the centre.</p>
<p>Receiving the jab, Mr Shapps said: “I received my call from the GP surgery to come for my first vaccination- actually I was so surprised to receive the call I actually called back and checked they got it right. Turns out that it’s because a couple of decades ago I had cancer and have been in remission for a very long time from that- but here we are.</p>
<p>“I’m going to have my jab and then have a little tour to thank the volunteers and NHS staff.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is this: when you’re called for your jab, make sure you book it in and make sure you go and get it, and together we can protect each other.”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps released a video on the day of his vaccination, which can be viewed below:</p>

<p>I recently coordinated a cross party <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20">letter</a> with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.</p>



<p>As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.</p>



<p>I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.</p>



<p>The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay.

<p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br />
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br />
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br />
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br />
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br />
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br />
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br />
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br />
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
