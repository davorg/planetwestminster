<p>Isles MP Angus MacNeil has welcomed confirmation today from the Scottish Government that oil and gas workers returning home from countries not on the acute risk list will not have to isolate for 10 days in a hotel.</p>

<p>Mr MacNeil has been calling for changes to be made to the exemption list after having been contacted by many oil workers.</p>



<p>Commenting Angus MacNeil said:</p>



<p>“I am pleased to see that the Scottish Government has listened, and changes have now been made to the exemption list which will mean that workers in the oil and gas sector returning home for Denmark, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Germany, Netherlands or Norway.&nbsp; This will be a huge relief for the oil workers and their families.”</p>



<p>ENDS</p>

<p><strong>Sir John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con):</strong> I strongly support the green VAT cuts. Did the Committee examine the future of the petrol and diesel car industry, and especially the future of the diesel engine parts, with all the skilled staff and big assets, if the Government move to an early ban on these new vehicles?</p>
<p><strong>Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con): </strong>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his question.</p>
<p>The Committee is taking an interest in the impact of a transition from the current economy, with its carbon-intensive sectors, to a net zero economy. We are looking at our future programme and some of the impacts of green jobs, which we are in the middle of an inquiry on now, and we will be addressing specifically the point that he makes about the impact on the motor sector.</p>
<p>In the future, we are interested in some of the impacts of moving from an internal combustion engine source of transport to electrified transport and what that might do across different transport sectors. We will be working with the Transport Committee to ensure that we do not duplicate efforts, but that we are able to look into those matters.</p>

<p>On the floor of the House of Commons this week, local MP Tim Farron pushed ministers to do more to protect renters who are at risk of being made homeless because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A new loophole in the Government's ban on evictions means that people who owe more than six months rent can now be evicted from their home.</p>
<p>Tim has signed a cross-party letter from over 20 Parliamentarians to the Government asking them to ban evictions of people who are in rent debt.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament during a ministerial statement on rough sleeping, Tim said: <em>"The Secretary of State promised that no one would lose their home due to the pandemic.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"The moratorium on evictions has helped to keep people off the streets, but it covers only those people with rental debt up to six months, and of course the pandemic has been going on now for something like 12 months.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"There are 1,500 people in South Lakeland who are both private renters and members of workforce groups that have been excluded from Government support, with no income to pay the rent.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"How will he keep his promise to them?"</em>
</p>
<p>Responding, the Secretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick said: <em>"I am proud of the action that we have taken to support renters throughout the pandemic.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"The honourable gentleman is right to draw attention to the moratorium on evictions that I introduced early on with my right honourable and learned friend the Lord Chancellor.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"We have chosen to extend that on at least one more occasion to the end of March. That enables people to be safe and secure in the knowledge that they will not be forced out of their homes.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"There are exceptions to it, but they are the right exceptions. There are exceptions for domestic abuse perpetrators, for those who have committed serious antisocial behaviour which is damaging the lives of their neighbours, and for those who are in egregious rent arrears of six months or more. We have to strike a balance between the interests of the tenant and those of smaller landlords as well, some of whom are in very difficult circumstances.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"We have also created a six-month notice period for evictions, which means that people have a very long period to adjust to changing circumstances."</em>

<p>Post-Brexit and pandemic, putting consumers at the heart of our approach to regulation will be integral to ensuring that the UK can grow into the independent and dynamic economy it aims to be. Putting consumers first requires good regulation, and proper competition. </p>



<p>In his new report &#8216;Power to the People&#8217;, commissioned by the Chancellor and the Business Secretary, John Penrose MP argues that overcoming the recent threats and challenges the UK has faced will not be easy, but focusing on the right policies from the outset will undoubtedly ease the process. He offers a &#8216;recipe book&#8217; of policies to boost competition and turn the UK into an economic powerhouse. </p>



<p>During this event, John Penrose MP will discuss the report and its recommendations and the panel will explore the role of good regulation and competition in driving economic growth.</p>



<p><em>With John Penrose MP, Chair &#8211; Conservative Policy Forum; Sam Bowman, Director of Competition Policy &#8211; ICLE; Amelia Fletcher CBE, Professor of Competition Policy &#8211; NBS and Deputy Director &#8211; Centre for Competition Policy; chaired by Tom Clougherty, Head of Tax, Centre for Policy Studies.</em></p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>The constituency of Edgbaston has seen a 66% rise in the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits in the last 12 months. </p>
<p>Across the UK, unemployment figures are standing at an eye-watering 1.74 million people and which equates a national average of 6.2%. For Edgbaston it’s even higher, reaching 9% of the population aged between 16-64 years old.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “While it’s a disgrace that we’re in the worst economic crisis of any major economy, the Midlands is being particularly hard hit. The Government promised that it would ensure the rest of the country, West Midlands included, would see a levelling up.That is nowhere in sight and what we’re left with is the absolute reverse.</p>
<p>“This is of no surprise from a Conservative Government which has spent the last decade making massive cuts to the public sector. Birmingham City Council has seen its budget cut by more than £750 million in the last ten years. West Midlands Police has lost more than 2,100 officers and has suffered a further £175 million of cuts. Both of these examples are just the start of the stripping away of much needed public sector services that residents rely upon. How does the Government expect to level up towns and cities when its wider infrastructure that supports both businesses and their citizens have been decimated? </p>
<p>“If we are to start to see a reverse in our fortunes and a true levelling up of our society, we need the Government to act now. They can do this by giving businesses across Edgbaston certainty ahead of next week’s budget.”</p>
<p>Labour is calling for extending the business rates holiday by at least six months and the reduced rate of VAT for six months (or three months after public health restrictions are lifted – whichever is later).</p>
<p>Labour has also called for a ‘smart’ extension to the furlough scheme, with new training to help furloughed workers improve their skills and tough conditions on employers to stop abuse.</p>
<p>Preet continued, “These numbers aren’t just statistics. They are people in my constituency who are struggling to make ends meet. They are people wondering whether they will be keeping their job next month if the furlough scheme isn’t extended. They are people who are trying to support their families. The Government needs to act now to protect jobs, the economy and people’s livelihoods.”</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con) [V]</a></h3>

<p>First, I thank the Chair and members of the Backbench Business Committee for granting the opportunity to make this statement three sitting days before the Chancellor of the Exchequer rises to make his own statement to the House on his 2021 Budget. I am also grateful to the Exchequer Secretary for alerting me to the reason why she is not on the Treasury Bench; I know she is watching proceedings virtually, and I am grateful for her message earlier.</p>

<p>I would also briefly like to thank my colleagues on the Environmental Audit Committee, both past and present, who have been involved in this inquiry, which led to the report that I introduce today. From very early on in our work last year, it became abundantly clear that in creating policies to revive the economy after the devastating impact of the covid pandemic, the Government must take every opportunity to grow back greener—the name of our report. We have a golden opportunity to do so, with the Prime Minister genuinely committed to giving global leadership to this issue this year, as he will be hosting the G7 in Cornwall in four months’ time as well as the largest international conference ever hosted in this country, under the auspices of the United Nations conference on climate change in Glasgow, in nine months’ time.</p>

<p>In November last year, the Government intensified their ambition to meet their targets and obligations under the UN convention and the Paris agreement by increasing their commitments in publishing the nationally determined contribution for the UK, setting an example to the other countries that will be coming to the UK this year by confirming a 68% targeted reduction in 1990-level emissions by 2030—a key milestone on the path to net zero Britain by 2050. When the world congregates here, whether physically or virtually, for COP26, we want the UK to have a demonstrably powerful case of action, not just words, to inspire the rest of the world as to how a major industrialised economy can meet the challenge of climate adaptation.</p>

<p>It is therefore particularly critical that we do not miss the other clear opportunity that presents itself as the Chancellor decides next week which further exceptional fiscal and monetary levers to pull to revive the economy from its greatest contraction in over three centuries. I can put it no more simply than this: we must not repeat the mistakes of the past as we start to recover from covid. We must ensure that the measures we take will also materially help the goal of net zero Britain.</p>

<p>We have much to commend in how the Government have gone about the recovery to date. The Prime Minister’s 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution is a vital step towards the Government’s twin objectives of economic recovery and climate change adaptation. Similarly, the Chancellor’s national infrastructure strategy was accompanied by a revision of Green Book guidance so that investment decisions properly account for overarching Government net zero policy objectives.</p>

<p>These high-level strategies are now being backed up by further key staging posts, such as the energy White Paper, but the pause in progress on delivering Government policy caused by the covid crisis over the past 12 months must be overcome as the detailed plans and policies so vital to delivering on these objectives must be brought forward and implemented at pace and scale. Our Committee keeps receiving confirmation that the private sector is standing by with a wall of money to invest in projects that make a genuine contribution to the economic recovery and to net zero, and they need the demand signals and policy structures in place from Government to do so.</p>

<p>One policy for recovery that was brought out as an eye-catching measure when first announced as part of the summer economic package last year, which we applauded as showing a strong and positive direction of travel, is now, I regret to say, threatening to catch the eye for all the wrong reasons. Unless it is urgently overhauled, the green homes grant, with its ambitious target of retrofitting energy efficiency measures for up to 600,000 homes, risks giving this vital Government support a bad name.</p>

<p>Installers are quoting for work, but instead of taking on more staff and investing in training them to generate the green jobs of the future, they are actually having to lay off staff because homeowners are experiencing such unacceptable delays in having their planned work approved or voucher approvals paid. In many areas of the country, there are many homeowners who want to take up the Government’s offer of help with energy efficiency measures, but cannot find accredited installers willing to quote.</p>

<p>Even though funding for this scheme was extended until March 2022, which is welcome, it still seems mired in administrative delay, and now we read press reports that it might be ended entirely. This would be a grave error. There are 19 million homes that need energy efficiency measures to help to reduce the 17% of carbon emissions emanating from our homes. This has to be tackled with support from Government. The scheme needs to be overhauled and extended, not scrapped.</p>

<p>The Chancellor, in his Budget next week, will be the first who has absolute freedom to propose changes to the rates of value added tax, or to remove certain goods and services from VAT altogether, following Brexit. What better opportunity is there to use this new flexibility than to reduce rates of VAT on repair services and reused or recycled materials, and to encourage low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency improvements to our homes by cutting the VAT payable on green home upgrades? My hon. and right hon. Friends in the Treasury and their officials will shake their heads and tell me that any revenue forgone from such measures will have to be found from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Well, quite, and increases in taxation are bound to be less popular than reductions, but what a powerful means of addressing our throwaway culture and demonstrating that the Government genuinely back repair, reuse and recycling of goods. Is it not the case that such an investment in a circular economy would pay massive dividends in the long run?</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to highlight our recommendations on the Bank of England’s response to the economic crisis. I start by thanking the Governor of the Bank and his officials for the constructive approach that they have taken to our work, and by recognising the Bank’s excellent record in highlighting the financial risks from climate change above all other central banks. It was the first central bank to publish its own climate-related financial disclosure.</p>

<p>However, we regard the Bank as having missed a trick when introducing its financial support package for firms making a material contribution to the UK economy last year. In our view, the Bank’s purchase of commercial paper in those corporate businesses ought to have required more stringent sustainability conditions, as happened in other countries. In particular, the publication of climate-related financial disclosures should have been a requirement, in line with the Government’s green finance strategy.</p>

<p>The Governor of the Bank of England has rightly sought a little more clarity from the Government in the mandate that they set for the Monetary Policy Committee in its conduct of UK monetary policy. Our Committee has recommended that the Chancellor should make explicit that the Monetary Policy Committee should have regard in its work to the Government’s climate objectives, which it already does, but also to their nature objectives. That single, simple step would also assist the Bank in adjusting its corporate bond purchasing policy to support those objectives better in the future, to lead the way in reducing the carbon intensity of the UK corporate sector overall.</p>

<p>Our present challenges in the midst of this pandemic are being addressed by the ingenuity of scientists, the skill of the vaccine taskforce and the heroic efforts of the NHS and all its volunteers in organising the vaccine roll-out at such pace, but I am sorry to say—this will come as no surprise to the House—that there is no vaccine that is proof against runaway climate change. It is a challenge that requires all our effort and ingenuity, and changes in behaviour, to address.</p>

<p>The Government, in their response to the crisis, have shown encouraging signs of promoting a green recovery. Our report points out that there is much more to be done to sustain the recovery in a way that sees the UK set genuinely on a track to net zero. I commend the report to the House.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=146">Barry Gardiner (Brent North) (Lab) [V]</a></h3>

<p>I thank the Chair of the Committee not only for the way that he presented the report but for chairing the Committee with such patience, tact and, often, good humour.</p>

<p>Covid has caused unprecedented hardship, physical, mental and economic. The Government’s own figures suggest an 11% contraction of our economy this year and a loss of 1.5 million jobs from the high street. That comes just as the economy is embarking on a profound transition away from transport and heating infrastructures based on fossil fuels, which will see even more jobs lost in those old industries, with unemployment forecast to rise to 2.6 million this year.</p>

<p>The report is clear that not only is retrofitting and upgrading the 29 million UK homes essential to meet our 68% emissions reduction target by 2030, but it would be a huge creator of new jobs. Does the Chair agree, then, that the Government should bring forward much greater investment in energy efficiency programmes and resolve the serious delivery problems around the green homes grant?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is a valiant supporter on the Committee, for his comments about our report and the way the Committee operates. He is absolutely right. This measure, when introduced last year, was a really positive signal that, of the Government’s manifesto commitment of more than £9 billion to invest in energy-efficiency improvements to buildings, £1.5 billion was to go towards owner-occupiers and the private rented sector, whereas the rest is likely to go to social housing and other types of public building.</p>

<p>However, the scheme has been suffering from very low take-up because of the extraordinary administrative burden that was imposed on accessing it; the lack of qualified tradesmen to undertake the work, because they have to go through a particular certification process that few companies have been prepared to secure; and the challenge of the duration of the scheme. It is difficult to persuade contractors to take on staff to do the work or even, frankly, to quote for the work if the scheme is coming to an end in a short period. It was initially a six-month scheme. Thankfully, it was extended to an 18-month scheme, running out only 13 months from now, but that is not enough. We think that this scheme should endure for the whole Parliament, and it should be supported and improved by the Government. We hear from newspaper reports that there is a risk of it being scrapped. That would be a retrograde step, particularly at a time when we have the eyes of the world on us for the schemes we are introducing to address some of the carbon emission challenges and the targets we have made.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=390">Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton)</a></h3>

<p>I remind Members that we must have short questions and answers, because we have two very well-subscribed debates this afternoon, and we only have 20 minutes put aside for this session, which means we have about five minutes left.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=4739">Jerome Mayhew (Broadland) (Con) [V]</a></h3>

<p>I will do my best, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Committee’s report highlights the evidence from the Bank of England that we will need a carbon tax of about $100 per tonne by 2030 for a smooth transition of the economy to net zero. If we want to prevent large-scale offshoring of our industry and support the growth of low-carbon manufacturing here in the UK, we will need a scheme of carbon border adjustment. The EU and the USA are already working on this policy, which is both a good and a bad thing. Does my right hon. Friend agree that our presidencies of both the G7 and COP26 are an unmissable opportunity to lead an international approach to carbon border adjustment, rather than risk the imposition of piecemeal protectionist carbon barriers by individual trading blocs, with us on the outside?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is no question but that unilateral introduction of such a scheme has the potential to be more damaging than an international agreement. Our report recommended that the Treasury consider the issues of carbon pricing and carbon border adjustment, and I very much hope that it will take that recommendation forward.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1491">Kerry McCarthy (Bristol East) (Lab) [V]</a></h3>

<p>I congratulate the right hon. Member and his Committee on this report. I see that it calls for new road projects to be explicitly appraised against air quality, biodiversity and climate change commitments, which I very much welcome. It has now been reported that the Transport Secretary overruled advice from his own civil servants on the need to conduct an environmental review of the planned expansion of England’s road networks. Does the Committee intend to follow up on its report by raising that with the Secretary of State? Does he see a future role for the Committee in scrutinising the environmental impact of the road expansion policy if the Transport Secretary is unwilling to do so?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>I thank the hon. Lady for reading the report with her customary diligence to find those references. She was a very valuable member of the Committee for many years. The Committee will have to wait to see the Government’s response to our report. We will be looking for responses to all our recommendations, including in relation to transport, and we will then decide how to respond and how that will inform our further work, but her point is well made.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=4759">Joy Morrissey (Beaconsfield) (Con) [V]</a></h3>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for this report, which highlights the importance of maintaining our net zero target while focusing on our economic recovery. What steps does the report highlight to improve the shortcomings found in the green homes grant?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>This is the specific measure that the Government introduced with a view to achieving their objectives of stimulating the economy, meeting net zero obligations and generating jobs. At present, the scheme is disappointing in every respect. It requires a thorough overhaul of its administration, working closely with the industry and contractors to improve its implementation and providing more certainty by extending its duration.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=4602">Wera Hobhouse (Bath) (LD) [V]</a></h3>

<p>Given the report’s focus on the need to address our ecological crisis without delay, does the right hon. Gentleman agree that we need a strategy to devolve nature and that this is best done by devolving resources and power to local authorities?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>The hon. Lady is pre-empting our next inquiry into biodiversity and ecosystems. We will have a great deal to say in that report on how nature protection and conservation is focused on at both a national and a local level. I look forward to her observations on that in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=4825">Jacob Young (Redcar) (Con)</a></h3>

<p>As co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and chair of the APPG on hydrogen, I thank my right hon. Friend for his Committee’s report, specifically recommendations 20 and 21, which mention the urgent need for a hydrogen strategy. I completely agree, and I would be grateful if he elaborated on what policies he would like to see in the hydrogen strategy.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>I applaud the ground-breaking work that my hon. Friend is bringing to the House in relation to hydrogen through his leadership of the all-party parliamentary group, which is doing great work in raising awareness and suggesting solutions. I rather bow to his superior knowledge on this issue. I think the key thing for industry is to understand what the Government’s hydrogen strategy is, so getting it published will provide industry with a structure around which it can invest. There have been some encouraging signals in the 10-point green industrial revolution plan, but at the moment these seem to be modest steps and we need a full strategy to be published as soon as possible.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=3930">Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green) [V]</a></h3>

<p>I thank the Chair of our Committee and agree with all that he has said. Does he agree that there is real urgency for the carbon intensity of the Bank of England’s corporate bond portfolio to be cut and aligned with the Paris agreement? Analysis by the Bank itself shows that the portfolio is in step with a catastrophic 3.5° temperature rise, and this is clearly untenable, particularly if the UK aspires to be a credible host of COP26. He has spoken about the failure of the green homes grant. Does he agree that a failure to establish a revised scheme on a multi-year basis would do enormous damage both to businesses and consumers by destroying confidence and trust in any future home retrofit project? I have businesses in my constituency that face going bust because of the incompetence of this scheme.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>I thank the hon. Lady for her contribution to our Committee and her characteristically robust portrayal of some of our recommendations. I touched on the Bank of England in my remarks. The pace at which it seeks to adjust its portfolio is a matter for the Bank, but it has agreed to look at this in the response from the Governor, and that is a very good start. The Bank of England has led the way internationally in many of its approaches towards climate change, and COP26 provides it with an opportunity to do more. In relation to the green homes grant scheme, I completely agree that it must be turned into a multi-year scheme to provide confidence to installers up and down the country.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=4382">Daniel Zeichner (Cambridge) (Lab) [V]</a></h3>

<p>The Opposition very much welcome this report, with its sense of urgency and calls for action; we just wish the Government would match that. I agree with the comments on the green homes grant. I am delighted that the Committee recommends a national nature service pilot, which Labour has been calling for. We have also been calling for the Government to bring forward £30 billion in planned capital investment as part of a rapid stimulus package to support up to 400,000 new clean jobs in manufacturing and other key sectors. Does the Committee Chair agree that that is the scale of ambition that we will need if we are to see nature at the centre of a green recovery?</p>

<p>I am grateful for the welcome that the hon. Gentleman has just given. I am delighted to hear that those on the Labour Front Bench are keen on a national nature service. It was first recommended in a report that we did as a Committee two or three years ago, so I am glad that all parts of the House are catching up with our Committee in its recommendations. On the scale of the measures that are required, our Committee did not seek to quantify them, but we absolutely recognise that this is a multi-year, multibillion-pound effort required in order to achieve the net zero ambition. It will reach across all elements of society and the economy; minor measures will not move the dial.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=14">John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con) [V]</a></h3>

<p>I strongly support the green VAT cuts. Did the Committee examine the future of the petrol and diesel car industry, and especially the future of the diesel engine parts, with all the skilled staff and big assets, if the Government move to an early ban on these new vehicles?</p>

<h3><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?house=Commons&memberId=1542">Philip Dunne </a></h3>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his question. The Committee is taking an interest in the impact of a transition from the current economy, with its carbon-intensive sectors, to a net zero economy. We are looking at our future programme and some of the impacts of green jobs, which we are in the middle of an inquiry on now, and we will be addressing specifically the point that he makes about the impact on the motor sector. In the future, we are interested in some of the impacts of moving from an internal combustion engine source of transport to electrified transport and what that might do across different transport sectors. We will be working with the Transport Committee to ensure that we do not duplicate efforts, but that we are able to look into those matters.</p>

<p>A key pledge by the Prime Minister at the General Election was to increase the number of nurses in our NHS by 50,000. So it is great news that UCAS applications have increased by over a third in the last 12-months to 50,000 applicants.</p>
<p>The nursing profession has been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 in hospitals across the country, including locally at Walsall Manor, and also in social care settings and in the community and their heroic actions should never be forgotten. It is therefore really good to see so many others want to be part of the profession.</p>

<p>Local MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, has spoken of his delight as the Government has finally moved on allowing E10 – a lower-carbon fuel made with up to 10% bioethanol – onto the petrol market in the UK.</p>
<p>The decision to allow the greener fuel onto the market means that Saltend-based Vivergo Fuels, which previously processed wheat into bioethanol, will once again be able to open its doors from next year.</p>
<p>Before its closure in September 2018, Vivergo processed around 1.1 million tonnes of wheat from approximately 900 farms across the North East and Yorkshire at its £350 million plant in Saltend, which is in Graham’s constituency. At the time around 130 of its employees were made redundant, but it was estimated that its closure indirectly affected around 3,000 more jobs across the region and it contributed £600 million to the UK economy.</p>
<p>Bringing E10 onto the UK market, which follows a public consultation held last spring, means that some of these jobs should come back next year.</p>
<p>Graham said, “This is fantastic news for jobs in our region and for our environment too. Restoring the plant at Saltend will help contribute to reducing transport CO2 emissions by up to 750,000 tonnes every single year.</p>
<p>“I was very proud to have the UK’s largest producer of bioethanol in my constituency and I met with their team frequently when difficulties in the market became apparent in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>“Not only did they directly employ hundreds of local people in skilled jobs but they were also a crucial buyer of crops for local farmers, and their by-products are also very important in the production of animal feed.”</p>
<p>Dr Mark Carr, Group Chief Executive of AB Sugar, commented: “It was an extremely difficult decision we had to take to close in September 2018, but we have continued to maintain this world-class plant in the anticipation that it could re-start if the conditions were right to do so. </p>
<p>“With the Government’s announcement to introduce E10 to UK vehicles and improved market conditions, we are re-opening the plant and will start manufacturing bioethanol in early 2022.</p>
<p>“We will once again be investing in creating a highly skilled workforce and will be looking to recruit around 85 people for specialist roles over the coming weeks, as well as seeking opportunities with past partners, growers and customers whose support since 2007 has been invaluable.</p>
<p>“This is good news for a sustainable British biofuels industry, the economy within the Humber region, the environment and consumers. I look forward to our continued investment and ambition for the UK bioethanol industry.”</p>
<p>In September 2020, the Government changed the law so that all petrol stations had to introduce new labels to help motorists select the correct fuel and it anticipates that in 2021, 98% of petrol cars on our roads will be fully compatible with E10.</p>
<p>Graham added, “E10 petrol should be embraced, as its benefits for the environment are equivalent to about 300,000 cars being taken off our roads each year.</p>
<p>“Vivergo also produce high-quality, protein-rich animal feed as a by-product, which reduces our dependency on soy imports from South America. Needless to say, this benefits the UK’s food security – not to mention the fact that it cuts transport emissions and helps prevent deforestation.”</p>

<p>This week I took part in the Parliamentary debate on COVID-19, following the Prime Minister&#8217;s &#8216;roadmap out of lockdown&#8217; announcement.</p>



<p>I opened by paying tribute to all those involved in delivering the vaccine across the 4 nations of the UK, including healthcare staff, volunteers and the armed forces. At the time of my contribution, 1,445,488 first doses of the vaccine had been administered in Scotland alone.</p>



<p>Public Health Scotland&#8217;s initial data shows a vaccine effectiveness rate of between 84% and 94% in reducing Covid-related hospitalisations; welcome news indeed. However, we must still proceed cautiously and do everything we can do suppress the virus as moving too fast simply risks it remaining in circulation and mutating into new, vaccine resistant strains.</p>



<p>I was, therefore, concerned when the PM, despite promising to focus on &#8216;data rather than dates&#8217;, nonetheless proceeded to announce a long list of dates whereby they hope to lift various restrictions, and still without ensuring certain basic measures are in place, including the provision of an effective &#8216;test, trace, isolate and SUPPORT&#8217; system as lockdown restrictions are eased and tightening travel restrictions for those coming into the UK.</p>



<p>The idea that you either choose public health or you choose the economy is a false dichotomy as we know from other countries which have successfully followed elimination strategies that acting quickly and stringently with Covid allows for the safe re-opening of more economic sectors at earlier stages.</p>

<h3>Dr Philippa Whitford MP</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As we move into the second year of covid, and despite still being in lockdown, there are key positives to be celebrated. The vaccine roll-out is progressing quickly, and staff in all four national health services should be congratulated, along with the Army, who have provided logistical expertise, and the thousands of volunteers who have helped to ensure the safety and organisation of vaccination centres. Vaccine uptake has been way above expectations and, with the hope that vaccination will prevent viral transmission as well as protecting the recipient, everyone who rolls up their sleeve is contributing to the fight against the pandemic. However, concerns remain about lower vaccine uptake among certain groups, including some who are particularly vulnerable to covid, such as BAME communities. Anyone offered the vaccine should take up their appointment. If they have questions, there is information on the NHS websites, or they can ask their local GP practice.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Until now, any increase in covid cases has led to an inevitable rise in hospitalisation and deaths just a few weeks later, but as more vulnerable groups are vaccinated, that is starting to change. We are already seeing the benefit to those who were vaccinated first in Scotland. An analysis of over 1 million vaccine recipients by Public Health Scotland has today revealed a reduction in hospitalisation of between 85% and 94% for the two vaccines. Owing to its integrated structure, Scotland’s NHS was able to get permission from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to deliver the Pfizer vaccine to all elderly care homes from 13 December. That has led to a 62% drop in deaths among residents throughout January. That dramatic fall will, we hope, be replicated in data across the rest of the UK in just the coming weeks.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As the Prime Minister has highlighted, one possible threat to the success of the vaccination programme would be the importation of a more vaccine-resistant variant, such as that which has arisen in South Africa and has already been shown to be resistant to antibodies from those who have recovered from covid. This threat makes it inexplicable that when the UK Government have finally decided to set up monitored border quarantine, it is on such a limited basis—so much for following the science! There should be mandatory quarantine for arrivals from all countries, as there is nothing to prevent someone from travelling from South Africa or Brazil via a third country. The South African variant is already present in at least 35 other countries and new variants could be evolving as we speak. The Government’s suggestion that people will be able to travel abroad for summer holidays seems to be courting danger, as many countries will not be vaccinated and therefore pose an increased risk that holidaymakers would bring back new variants; surely this is a sacrifice we could all accept if it allowed children to be in school and our domestic economy to open up. This measure must, however, be combined with support for the aviation, aerospace and international tourism sectors.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>On the Prime Minister’s road map out of lockdown, I welcomed the suggestion that decisions that would be based on data rather than dates, but he then proceeded to announce a whole list of dates. Although it is good to see cases falling so dramatically across the UK, from almost 60,000 a day to just over 11,000 a day, case levels are still more than double what they were when SAGE&nbsp;called for a lockdown on 21 September. The number of covid patients in hospital is 10 times what it was last September and only just dropped below the peak of the first wave last week.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While Scotland has maintained lower case levels throughout the second and third waves, progress in all four nations is slowing, and this is thought to be due to the greater infectiousness of the B117 Kent variant. Thankfully, this variant appears to be just as sensitive to the immune response induced by current vaccines, but every time the virus spreads and replicates itself, there is an opportunity for mutation and the risk of a problematic domestic variant emerging, including one that might be resistant to our current vaccines. The UK has already faced three waves of covid and three lockdowns, and it is important that current restrictions remain until case levels have been driven low enough to give the vaccine programme a chance to succeed and health services time to recover. It is not a matter of setting the economy against public health; it is through stopping community spread that we would be able to get our domestic economy and society back up and running.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Once covid levels have been brought down, it is critical to have an effective system to test, trace and isolate those who could be carrying the virus, in order to keep control of the outbreak. Unfortunately, one in eight cases are still not being reached by NHS Test and Trace, and surveys suggest that as few as one in three people are isolating when required. The commonest reason is that they cannot afford to lose their income, yet more than half of those applying for the Government’s support payment are being turned down, which makes it very unlikely that they would then isolate. The Government need to widen the eligibility criteria and review the level of payment, which is less than the minimum wage. It is in everyone’s interest to ensure that those who could be carrying the virus isolate so we avoid onward spread. All these measures carry a cost, but when we see the flourishing domestic economies of the countries that acted quickly and stringently last year, we can see the cost of not taking action, both in lives and in economic damage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, has signed a cross party letter to the Prime Minister and Chancellor calling on the Government to urgently provide a funding “super-boost” to cancer services at the Spring Budget to clear the COVID induced cancer backlog and prevent tens of thousands of additional lives being lost.</p>
<p>The letter signed by 75 Parliamentarians also calls for a new high-tech cancer recovery plan driven by innovative capacity building solutions, like advanced radiotherapy, delivered with the same level of political will as the overall COVID response.</p>
<p>The letter, backed by the #CatchUpWithCancer campaign, reflects Parliamentarians’ concerns that the existing Cancer Recovery Plan is out of date and the Cancer Recovery Taskforce does not have the power to secure the required investment in additional treatment and diagnostic capacity needed to properly tackle the backlog.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The pandemic has had a really serious impact on cancer services and it is clear that there needs to be a new recovery plan backed up with the funding needed to implement it.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a growing crisis and action is needed urgently. The Budget is a chance to get things moving and I would urge the Government not to miss the opportunity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Leading oncologist and founder of the #CatchUpWithCancer campaign Professor Pat Price said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“We are going to be looking back in years to come at COVID caused cancer nightmare that led to as many cancer patients being lost unnecessarily as we lose to coronavirus itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t have to be this way. We can save both COVID and cancer patients. But that needs a change in approach, proper accountability and hard cash at the budget for cancer services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government should be lifting heaven and earth, just like the frontline clinicians already are, so that we have the tools, a comprehensive plan and a minister responsible for addressing this crisis and quickly.”</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Karin Smyth MP takes apprenticeships campaign to Government Minister</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, today chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Apprenticeships ‘Ask Apprentice Panel’ as part of National Apprenticeship week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bristol South MP, who has been a champion of quality apprenticeships for many years, highlighted the importance of government support for apprentices now in the midst of the pandemic, and urged the Apprenticeships Minister to ensure that all levels of apprenticeships are protected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those attending the meeting included Minister for Apprenticeships, Gillian Keegan MP, apprentices from Amazon, BAE Systems, KPMG, and the Co-Op.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Chair, Karin Smyth MP pressed the Government to take a holistic approach to apprenticeships and emphasised the opportunity to now strengthen some of the proposals within the Skills for Jobs White Paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is important that as a parliamentary group, we scrutinise government policy carefully, especially when it can have such a huge impact on people’s future skills and education. National Apprenticeship week 2021 gives us the chance to drive home the fact that apprenticeships must have parity of esteem in the world of education and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the APPG on Apprenticeships meeting we heard from talented apprentices and got to learn what more we can do to support them. As our economy begins to recover from Covid-19 we will need proper investment in skills at all levels and for all ages, to help support our local communities achieve their potential.”</span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/02/24/karin-smyth-mp-takes-apprenticeships-campaign-to-government-minister/">Karin Smyth MP takes apprenticeships campaign to Government Minister</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

			<p>A new report by a cross party group of MPs as part of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Health in All Policies which I Chair has concluded that, five years on, the effect of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/7/contents/enacted">Welfare Reform &amp; Work Act 2016</a> has been ‘devastating’ to the health and wellbeing of people on low incomes.</p>
<p>The report which was launched today <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf"> can be read here.</a></p>
<p>This<a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf"> report</a> shows there is strong evidence from several sources that the cuts in social security support have contributed to increasing poverty and financial hardship in low income households which has particularly affected the poverty levels of children and disabled people.</p>
<p>The analysis has found overwhelming evidence showing how the Act has pushed many low income households into poverty and financial hardship, disproportionately affecting children and disabled people. The report describes the strong evidence showing the adverse causal relationship that this poverty has had on the health and well-being of those affected, particularly children, with every 1% increase in child poverty associated with an extra 5.8 infant deaths per 100,000 and a third of the increases in infant mortality between 2014 and 2017 attributed to rising poverty.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf">report</a> also reveals how the treatment of those people reliant on social security by the Department for Work and Pensions often leaves them feeling worthless and even ‘dehumanised’.</p>
<p>Looking at 5 specific measures within the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Act &#8211; the benefit cap, the benefit freeze, the two child limit, the abolition of £30 a week support for disabled people who were unfit for work (ESA WRAG) and the extension of sanctions to ‘responsible carers’ (parents of pre-nursery age children) – the APPG inquiry sought to identify the impacts of  these specific measures on household income and the impact that this may have on the behaviour and health of claimants and their families in the context of the 2012 social security cuts, and other wider ranging tax and public service changes.</p>
<p>The APPG also looked at the Government’s objectives for the 2016 Act to see how effective the measures had been in achieving these objectives and has made 16 recommendations including</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the social safety net sufficient for people not in full-time work to receive a minimum income for healthy living</li>
<li>Making permanent the £1,000-a-year increase in the standard allowance for Universal Credit</li>
<li>Removing sanctions and reduce conditionalities in benefit payments</li>
<li>Eradicating benefit caps and lifting the two-child limit</li>
<li>Providing tapering levels of benefits to avoid cliff edges</li>
<li>Ending the five-week wait for Universal Credit and providing cash grants for low-income households</li>
<li>Giving sufficient Government support to food aid providers and charities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2015 we looked at the <em>potential</em> impacts of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill on child poverty and health, and we wanted to compare these with the <em>actual</em> impacts. Again the focus was on the relationship between poverty, inequality and health, and in particular child health. (Read the APPG’s earlier report <a href="https://www.fph.org.uk/media/1374/appg-health-in-all-policies-inquiry-into-child-poverty-and-health2.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.)</p>
<p>Five years on, we have conducted a follow-up review of the actual impacts of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016.</p>
<p>There is a growing evidence base of the direct and negative impacts of different aspects of the social security system on the mental and physical health of claimants and their families, in addition to the indirect impacts mediated by poverty as a result of having inadequate income from work and/or social security support.</p>
<p>In addition to quantitative evidence we looked at qualitative studies which pointed to a process of ‘dehumanising’ claimants that eroded their self-esteem and confidence, making them feel worthless. In some cases, the whole experience had proved too much for some claimants and they have taken their own lives.</p>
<p>It’s important to note the knock-on impact that this ill health will have on health services and for social protection to be recognised as mitigating against socio-economic health risk factors.</p>
<p>Although the Government achieved their aim of cutting welfare spending by introducing these measures – working age spending on social security has shrunk by £34bn since 2010 – there has been minimal impact on helping to get people into work who wouldn’t have got into work without these measures.”</p>
<p><a href="https://debbieabrahams.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210221_HIAP-A4-Report-Debbie-Abrahams.pdf">The full report</a> was launched with a panel of speakers to discuss the findings and recommendations of the report including:</p>
<p>Professor Clare Bambra, University of Newcastle</p>
<p>Helen Barnard, Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p>
<p>Ellen Clifford, Disabled People Against Cuts</p>
<p>Professor David Taylor Robinson, University of Liverpool</p>
<p>Geoff Fimister, Disability Benefits Consortium</p>
<p>‘Aurora’ (not her real name) &#8211; a widowed parent of two children</p>
<p><strong>‘Aurora’</strong> said: &#8220;Our situation has been greatly impacted by the changes to the benefits system. We can no longer afford the essentials to ensure even a basic standard of living. After rent and deductions are paid there is nothing left. I do not feel supported by the DWP, and I feel our group have been ignored. The pandemic highlights a desperate requirement for reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need help to participate and become productive members of society. It is our children who invariably suffer, poverty has lasting effects, they bare the consequences of these policies.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Helen Barnard, JRF Director</strong>, said: “In the last year, millions more people have turned to social security to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The importance of a strong social security system to act as an anchor for all of us, preventing us being swept into poverty by unexpected events, illness or job loss has never been clearer.  This APPG report demonstrates starkly the damage done to individuals, families and communities by weakening social security.</p>
<p>As we look forward to the easing of the public health emergency, we must learn the lessons of the pandemic and of previous recessions and ensure that social security is strengthened. There is a long way to go before the economic storm passes; the government must live up to the promise of bringing us through that storm safely, starting by keeping the £20 uplift to Universal Credit and extending it to those on legacy benefits who have been unjustly excluded from additional support so far.</p>
<p><strong>Professor David Taylor-Robinson, University of Liverpool</strong>, said: “Even before covid-19, extremely disturbing trends in health were emerging in England. Growing child poverty, homelessness, and food poverty led to an unprecedented rise in infant mortality, mental health problems, and stalling life expectancy, especially for women in the poorest areas and cities. These were the same areas where 10 years of austerity measures had hit the poorest groups the hardest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The APPG report shows how reductions in social security for families with children have hit the most vulnerable communities. In addition larger cuts in government funding to local authorities with higher proportions of children in poverty have meant a reduction in spending on vital preventive services in areas where they were needed most.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that rising child poverty has myriad adverse impacts on multiple aspects of child health and development that will have repercussions for decades to come. It is time for the government to reverse these extremely concerning trends, establishing a welfare system that protects children from poverty and material deprivation.”</p>
<p><strong>Geoff Fimister, Policy Co-Chair, Disability Benefits Consortium</strong>, said: “As the economic fallout from the Covid crisis threatens to make life even tougher for disabled people, in or out of work – and as the Chancellor prepares his Budget and the Government proposes to announce details of its disability strategy later this year – this important report could hardly be more timely. It sets out clearly the impacts of austerity on disabled people and the measures needed to set a new direction and start to put things right.</p>
<p>The Disability Benefits Consortium is a network of more than 100 organisations concerned with achieving real social security for disabled people. We gave evidence to this inquiry – based on our research and on feedback from our members – and are very pleased to see such clear and well-founded analysis and  recommendations. We hope that the Government will take notice.”</p>
<p><strong>Professor Clare Bambra of Newcastle University</strong> commented: “Our results show the importance to protecting people’s mental health of adequate social safety nets. This is particularly relevant now as the lock down and the COVID-19 pandemic is already leading to deteriorations in people’s mental health. Our research suggests that the current increase to Universal Credit of £20 per week should be maintained in order to protect the mental health of the most vulnerable in our society.”</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Clifford, </strong><strong>Disabled People Against Cuts</strong>, said: “I very much welcome the report launched today. Since 2010, extensive work has been undertaken by Disabled People’s Organisations, charities, academics and journalists to investigate, document and research the disproportionate impacts of welfare reform measures on those with the lowest incomes in society including disabled people. Interrogating and reflecting upon that wide evidence-base, the APPG has produced a stark report that succeeds in cutting through the spin and selective use of figures to present a hard-hitting portrait of Britain today. We are the sixth richest country in the world and yet infant mortality is rising and life expectancy declining. The Resolution Foundation calculated that by 2022, the total annual savings in spending for working age social security claimants from 2010 would be £34billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In December 2020, the Marmot Review and analysis into the UK’s “high and unequal” Covid-19 death toll exposed key causes of this as existing poverty and inequalities driven by 10 years of austerity including social security cuts. Even after the £20 per week Universal Credit uplift, benefit claimants are receiving just 43.4% of the minimum income standard (MIS), which is the amount required for an acceptable standard of living. For those still on legacy benefits who have never been granted an uplift, their incomes are just 33.9% of the MIS. Many of these are disabled people, many have been shielding for over a year now and have seen their expenditures rise sharply as a result. The Disability Benefits Consortium recently published findings showing that 66% of disabled people on legacy benefits surveyed are having to choose between eating or heating.</p>
<p>&#8220;The news that the Universal credit uplift is set to continue for a further six months is welcome, but we need to urgently pressure the government into extending the uplift to legacy benefits. There is no question that the failure to do so has been detrimental to disabled people’s health and I echo the report recommendation calling for research into the long-term health effects of different social security levels to be carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions in conjunction with the Department for Health and Social Care. Ultimately what we need is a new social security system, one that provides a genuine safety net for all and that guarantees a decent standard of living. Only then will we begin to see a reversal of the regressive health and inequality trends of the past decade.”</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>The SNP has renewed calls on the UK government to urgently change rules to allow terminally ill people to get benefits fast-tracked, ahead of today’s debate in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Under current rules, benefits are only fast-tracked if a terminally ill person has a diagnosis of six months or less to live. A bill to change this law &#8211; co-sponsored by campaigning SNP MP Drew Hendry &#8211; has been brought before Parliament.</p>
<p>The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Terminal Illness – chaired by Mr Hendry &#8211; published a report on the issues facing terminally ill people trying to access welfare support just over a year ago. The report found that those affected face financial hardship and crippling debt due to a policy implemented three decades ago.</p>
<p>In Scotland, the SNP Government has said it will ensure anyone diagnosed with a terminal illness gets fast access to disability benefits when they are introduced.</p>
<p>Commenting, Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“I have been urging the UK government to take action on this issue facing terminally ill people for a long time and am pleased the issue will be debated today – the punitive ‘6 month or less’ policy preventing terminally ill people from accessing benefits must be scrapped.</p>
<p>“A year ago, the APPG on Terminal Illness’s inquiry report revealed that the ‘six month rule’ leaves terminally ill people facing devastating and far reaching financial hardship and crippling debt because of a policy brought in three decades ago that has no relevance now.</p>
<p>“The UK ministers promised a review of the policy two years ago following the report &#8211; instead we have been met with a deafening silence. The six-month rule has been failing terminally ill people and their families for years – a simple policy fix would stop that. I am urging the DWP to heed the widespread calls and scrap the policy once and for all.</p>

<p>More than 1 million laptops and tablets have now been delivered to schools and local authorities across England, as part of a £400 million investment that will support schools and young people for years to come.</p>
<p>The news comes after the Department for Education last month announced a further 300,000 laptops and tablets to help even more disadvantaged children and young people learn at home.</p>
<p>Schools are already receiving top ups to their original allocations – with those with the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils being prioritised first.</p>
<p>The 1.3 million devices the government is providing sits alongside a package of extensive support for the most disadvantaged children. This includes partnering with the UK’s leading mobile network operators to provide free data to disadvantaged families, alongside a further £300 million being invested in tutoring programmes building on the existing £1 billion Covid Catch Up Fund.</p>
<p>To further strengthen remote education provision, the government has also provided more than 54,000 4G routers to schools and colleges across England, ensuring no child is prohibited from receiving a quality education due to a lack of internet access.</p>
<p>To further bolster the quality of remote education for all students, the Government has strengthened the minimum standards for remote learning provision, so every child, no matter where they learn, receives the great education they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Worcester MP Robin Walker said: </strong></p>
<p>“No child should miss out as a result of the disruption caused by this pandemic. That is why it has been our priority to equip those children most in need with the resources they need to succeed.</p>
<p>“I very much welcome that young people across Worcestershire are continuing to benefit from the raft of measures the Government has put in place to help schools deliver high-quality learning, and the 3064 devices we now have received will ensure no child’s education is hindered, regardless of their background or circumstance.</p>
<p>“While we hope that all our children will be back learning in the classroom as soon as possible, we will do everything in our power to give them the world-class education they deserve as they learn at home.”</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:</strong></p>
<p>“I know what a challenging period this has been for pupils, teachers and parents &#8211; but it has been nothing short of inspiring to see schools and staff going above and beyond, as they always have done, to give our pupils the very best education possible.”</p>
<p>“Online access has been an important part of this work and will continue to be as we help young people catch-up after the disruption caused by the pandemic, which is why the delivery of these one million laptops is so vital. They represent one million children who will not let their education be overcome by this virus.”</p>
<p>“I want parents to know that we’ll continue to do everything we can to protect our children’s education at this unprecedented time and ensure they have the tools they need to get on with and make the most of their lives”.</p>

	<p>The vaccination programme is expanding across South West London and there are now over 238,000 vaccines across 40 vaccination centres, including 25 GP led centres, 8 hospital hubs, 4 pharmacy-led services and 3 large vaccination centres. With over 70% of vaccines delivered at primary care sites GPs have been leading the way in vaccinating local people to make sure vaccines are offered to all over 70s and front-line health and care staff by Monday 15 February 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone aged 70 and over who hasn’t  yet had an invitation for a vaccination is being asked to come forward and contact the NHS to book a jab through the national booking service</strong> – <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/5Bo9CMw3pC82rVDIkA4pC?domain=nhs.uk">www.nhs.uk/covid-vaccination</a> or by calling 119 free of charge between 7am and 11pm seven days a week. The national booking service allows people to book an appointment at their nearest large vaccination centre or pharmacy service. If a suitable and convenient slot is not available people can also call their GP practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about the vaccine and booking an appointment from NHS South West London Clinical Commissioning Group</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am confused about my second dose of the vaccine. Can you explain this to me?</strong></p>
<p>Both vaccines have been authorised on the basis of two doses because the evidence from the clinical trials shows that this gives the maximum level of protection.  To ensure as many people are vaccinated as quickly as possible, the Department for Health and Social Care now advise that the second dose of both the Oxford/AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine should be scheduled up to 12 weeks apart.  The evidence doesn’t show any risk to not having the second dose other than not being as protected as you otherwise would be.  Please be reassured that there are no safety concerns in the new guidance, and it will not impact on how effective the vaccination is in protecting you from Covid-19 once the course is complete.</p>
<p>You do not need to do anything to arrange your second dose. The NHS will contact you with your appointment details. Wait to be contacted. The second dose completes the course and is likely to be important for longer-term protection. It&#8217;s important to get both doses to protect yourself against coronavirus.</p>
<p>You may have a second appointment booked already and you should have a record card with details of your next appointment written on it, this will be around 12 weeks after your first appointment and at the same location where you received your first dose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I am over 70 and haven’t been contacted by my GP?</strong></p>
<p>Until now the NHS has asked people to wait until they are contacted to help ensure that those who are most vulnerable are protected first- and that remains the case for most people. However, whilst we have now vaccinated well over 84% of over 70s, to ensure absolutely everyone is offered the vaccine, people aged 70 and over can now contact the NHS so they can be vaccinated by the middle of this month. The easiest way to arrange a vaccination is through the national booking services which can be accessed at <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/NJuaCNL3qixZW5JFjbh0z?domain=nhs">www.nhs.uk/covid-vaccination.</a> If you are unable to book online can call 119 free of charge, anytime between 7am and 11pm seven days a week. The national booking service allows people to arrange a vaccination at their nearest vaccination centre or pharmacy service. If a suitable and convenient slot is not available people can also call their GP practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are the COVID-19 vaccines safe for people with long term conditions?</strong></p>
<p>Vaccines will be approved if it is considered safe for people with long-term conditions.  These vaccines are safe and effective for the vast majority of people – they have been tested on tens of thousands of people and assessed by experts. Your GP can advise on when you are eligible and will contact you with an appointment when it’s your turn.</p>
<p>A very small number of people who are at risk of COVID-19 cannot have the vaccine – this includes people who have severe allergies. Everybody will also be screened for potential allergic reactions before getting vaccinated. All vaccinators will have the training they need to deal with any rare cases of adverse reactions, and all venues will be equipped to care for people who need it – just like with any other vaccine.</p>
<p>The MHRA have updated their guidance to say that pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding can have the vaccine but should discuss it with a clinician to ensure that the benefits outweigh any potential risks. Women of childbearing age, those who are pregnant, or breastfeeding should read the <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/JXEECP73vFm0wA9t6dSaW?domain=nhs.uk/">detailed information available on NHS.UK</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do before I get my vaccine?  </strong></p>
<p>The NHS will contact you and invite you to book a vaccine appointment when it’s your turn. You may receive a phone call, letter or text message from your GP practice or a letter from the national booking service, so it’s useful to:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep an eye out to make sure you receive the message (for example if you have a mobile phone but don’t typically use text messages)</li>
<li>let your GP surgery know if you are caring for someone with underlying health conditions who would struggle to cope if you became unwell. You can help the vaccination effort by emailing your GP practice or using its website to make sure your local surgery knows you are an unpaid carer.</li>
<li>update your contact details if they have changed lately – it’s a good time to make sure your GP practice has the most up to date information.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you’re registered with a GP and have up to date contact details you should receive an invitation in due course. For more information how to register with a GP and to find your local surgery visit: <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/JmNNCRO3xslG6PoHQhY3c?domain=nhs.uk">www.nhs.uk/register</a></p>
<p>To find out about what to expect at your vaccine appointment please visit: <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/0Ej7CVA3BFK2JjmfEopLi?domain=nhs.uk/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/what-happens-at-your-appointment/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are teachers eligible to receive a vaccine?</strong></p>
<p>The NHS is currently only offering vaccines to people within England&#8217;s first four priority groups, in line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidelines. This does not include teachers, unless they also meet age or health-related criteria. Vaccinating the priority groups first will save the most lives and provide the quickest and safest route out of the pandemic.</p>

<p>I recently coordinated a cross party <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20">letter</a> with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.</p>



<p>As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.</p>



<p>I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.</p>



<p>The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.</p>

<p><strong>Hertfordshire has now received 8,860 laptops and tablets to help support disadvantaged children and young people while they learn at home. More than 1 million devices have now been delivered with more on their way.</strong></p>



<p>MP for Welwyn Hatfield Grant Shapps has welcomed the announcement that pupils across Hertfordshire have benefited from 8,860 laptops and tablets to date, as the government hits an important milestone in its rollout of devices to support disadvantaged students.</p>



<p>Hatfield based company Computacenter has been a key part of the £400 million Department of Education scheme, as well as assisting the Computers for Kids initiative.</p>



<p>The Department announced last month a further 300,000 laptops and tablets to help even more disadvantaged children and young people learn at home.</p>



<p>In addition, the government is partnering with the UK’s leading mobile network operators to provide free data to disadvantaged families, alongside a further £300 million being invested in tutoring programmes building on the existing £1 billion Covid Catch Up Fund.</p>



<p>Commenting, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “No child should miss out as a result of the disruption caused by this pandemic. It’s been our priority to equip the children in most need with the tools they need to get on with their learning.</p>



<p>“It’s great to see that so many electronic devices have been delivered across the country. It’s also brilliant to see a company based here in Welwyn Hatfield take a leading role in supplying these devices.</p>



<p>“Of course, whilst we hope that our children will be back learning in school as soon as possible, we will do everything in our power to give them the world-class education they deserve as they learn at home.</p>



<p>Over 1 million laptops and tablets delivered, with 8,860 to Hertfordshire kids alone, will go a long way in helping us deliver this.”</p>



<p>Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “I know what a challenging period this has been for pupils, teachers and parents &#8211; but it has been nothing short of inspiring to see schools and staff going above and beyond, as they always have done, to give our pupils the very best education possible.”</p>



<p>“I want parents to know that we’ll continue to do everything we can to protect our children’s education at this unprecedented time and ensure they have the tools they need to get on with and make the most of their lives”.</p>

<p>Following a leaked Ministry of Defence report last weekend that showed 32 of 33 infantry battalions are dangerously short of battle-ready personnel, Labour are demanding the Government to do more safeguard the strength of Britain’s full-time forces.</p>
<p>Labour is planning to use the Armed Forces Bill, debated in the Commons last Monday [8 February], to mandate Ministers to report to Parliament each year on the fighting strength of the Armed Forces</p>
<p>Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah reporters “this leaked report is the latest of many concerns that the Tories are not maintaining the Armed Forces. In 2015 the Tories promised to maintain the size of the regular Armed Forces and to not reduce the Army to below 82,000 but that promise was broken amid a botched £1.3 billion recruitment contract and long-running problems with retention stemming from dissatisfaction with pay, housing and low morale.”</p>
<p>The size of full-time, fully-trained Army personnel has shrunk from 102,200 in 2010 to 75,310 in 2020, well below the commitment of 82,000 and the overall numbers of personnel across the Armed Forces are down by 43,645 [a cut of 25%] since 2010.</p>
<p>In fresh concerns for the local Fenham Barracks, a new defence review due to be published by the Government next month, is feared to be cutting another 10,000 men and women from the forces nationwide.</p>
<p>Chi Onwurah said “Fenham base is not only a major employer but an important part of our community, people in this area are rightly proud of the military heritage in our area. Loosing further jobs through cuts in this review would be devastating for the town. I urge Minister to think hard before making any rash decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey MP, said:</strong></p>
<p>“I have serious concerns that Britain’s Armed Forces remain 10,000 below the total strength Ministers have said is needed, and I believe there is cross-party support for making sure the MoD keeps our full-time forces up to strength and battle-ready.</p>
<p>“The strength of our forces should rightly be set to meet the multiplying security threats Britain faces and the Government’s new Integrated Review must give a clear commitment on this. Ministers must avoid the mistakes of past decade and put our fighting men and women at the heart of future defence plans.”</p>

Happy New Year and welcome to my new MP newsletter. Like most people my movements have been hugely curtailed due to the pandemic and I haven’t managed to be out and about as I’d want for several months.

<p>One of the actions of Nottingham City Council’s <a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/media/2619917/2028-carbon-neutral-action-plan-v2-160620.pdf">Carbon Neutral Action Plan</a> is to campaign for divestment and move the Nottinghamshire Local Government Pension Scheme away from fossil fuels investments. This is why ahead of their Annual General Meeting tomorrow I submitted a question on behalf of City members of the scheme, and urged the Fund to commit to consult with its members on a divestment strategy and timeline before their next AGM. This is essential to ensure the long term sustainability of the Fund and to play it’s part in the prevention of catastrophic climate change.<br> <br>The Pension Fund covers over 300 members including Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, the District Councils and many other organisations who are generally non-profit making, or are undertaking a service which was, or could be carried out by the Local Authority. It is controlled by County Councillors and the City Council has no voting rights on the Pension Fund.  <br><br> I know that the primary responsibility of the Pension Fund is to protect the financial benefits of the scheme, and now that there is growing evidence that fossil fuel investments are performing less well than comparators it is the time to grasp the divestment nettle. Currently Nottinghamshire Pension Fund holds at least £170m in fossil fuel company shares and has no investments in sustainable, low carbon or renewable energy equity funds.<br><br>Given over 1300 institutions worldwide have already committed to divestment, including at least 10 UK local government pension funds and a large number of UK universities and faith organisations, it is time for Nottinghamshire to catch up and  do its bit for a sustainable future. <br><br>You can watch the Nottinghamshire Pension Fund AGM live on <a href="https://youtu.be/wdMyWgYd-gA">Youtube</a> from tomorrow at 10:30am. Further information about the agenda of the meeting and those in attendance can be found on the <a href="https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/dms/Meetings/tabid/70/ctl/ViewMeetingPublic/mid/397/Meeting/5514/Committee/526/SelectedTab/Documents/Default.aspx">Nottinghamshire County Council website</a>. </p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>

<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Parliament, I&#8217;ve continued to highlight the difficulties faces by our local businesses, such as the events industry and conference centres (you can read my question to the Secretary of State for Business on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-15a.136.1&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g137.4">here</a>), and supporting local high streets (which you can read more on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-02a.313.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g327.4">here</a>).</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

<p>“I am delighted at the fantastic news for County Antrim that Ryanair have today announced a huge investment in their operations at Aldergrove airport.<br />
Ryanair have today confirmed they will be investing in three new aircraft to be based here and intend to run 4 flights daily to Gatwick as a result.<br />
The company anticipate carrying over 1 million passengers in their first year of expanded operations and will bring 750 new jobs to the aerospace industry here.<br />
The increased number of flights will not only benefit this industry but those of the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well.<br />
It is wonderful to see that the negotiations, which have been ongoing for a considerable length of time now, have resulted in success for both Ryanair and the Northern Ireland economy.<br />
We have a very proud aerospace industry here in Northern Ireland and it is very much engrained in our manufacturing heritage with the likes of Shorts Brothers, now Bombardier, having been established in Northern Ireland since the end of the Second World War.<br />
We have gone through an extremely difficult 18 months in County Antrim with the announced closures of both the JTI Gallaher tobacco plant and the Michelin tyre factory bringing about almost 1800 redundancies and this investment is a huge step forward in finding new jobs and new opportunities for the people of this area.<br />
Ryanair’s investment of £300 million will boost our local wage economy enormously and all of our local businesses and town centres will reap the benefits as a result.<br />
Ryanair are also in discussions with Tourism Ireland to explore the possibility of introducing five new routes and I have every faith that Tourism Ireland and all other sectors who would benefit from such an arrangement will do everything they can to ensure its successful delivery.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
