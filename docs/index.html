              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong>Judith Cummins MP on Tuesday called for the government to step up and provide 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services in England.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Osteoporosis is a long-term health condition characterised by weak bones prone to breaking or fracture. It affects 3.5m people across the UK: a fifth of men and half of women over 50.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report by the Royal Osteoporosis Society found that 90,000 people miss out on the treatment every year and some 2.2 million people in the UK are left with undiagnosed spinal fractures. Fracture Liaison Services&nbsp;are an essential means of identifying and treating osteoporosis early. Yet, only 57% of people in England have access to this quality of life improving service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking in the Chamber, Judith called on the government to provide the necessary services, which could prevent over thirty thousand hip fractures by identifying bone problems early:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An investment of just £27 million per year in Fracture Liaison Services would deliver over £600 million in savings over five years for the NHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Will the Minister meet with me and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, to discuss our report, and commit to ending the postcode lottery by providing 100% coverage for Fracture Liaison Services for over-50s in England?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding, Secretary of State for Health Steve Barclay MP agreed: “Obviously, she sets out a very compelling case in terms of the return on investment. Clearly, we will need to scrutinise that in more detail.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://judithcummins.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_03_07-FLS-ROS-Health-Q.mp4"></video><figcaption>Judith hears from the Health Secretary there is a &#8216;compelling case&#8217; for investing in FLS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking afterwards, Judith emphasized the need to act now to ensure that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and people are not unnecessarily left in pain with debilitating fractures:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bradford has an exemplary fracture liaison service, but almost half of the country must do without. When these early opportunities to prevent fractures are missed there is a greater pressure on ambulances, acute hospital bed days, and greater stress on the NHS.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By acting now to provide full Fracture Liaison Services coverage right across England, we can save people unnecessary pain, save the NHS vital resources, and give all patients the level of care they deserve.”&nbsp;</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Today, in the House of Commons, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron had a request for a meeting concerning the government's support for a mobile radiotherapy unit at Westmorland General Hospital ignored.</p>
<p>It came after the Minister responsible for cancer care, Helen Whately, also ignored Tim's request for the Government's support on a campaign from the All Party Parliamentary Group on radiotherapy. The campaign seeks a £1 billion boost in radiotherapy treatment to increase capacity and update technology.</p>
<p>Speaking in the debate, Tim said: <em>"In South Cumbria 27% of people diagnosed with cancer are waiting over two months for their first treatment, and in North Cumbria that figure is 44%.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Imagine how terrifying it is to be told that you have a dangerous disease and that you may have to wait two months for your first intervention. People are dying needlessly."</em>
</p>
<p>In her reply, the Minister drew attention to the fact that the Government were attempting to reduce backlogs across the NHS but chose to ignore all other points made by Tim.</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Tim said: <em>"The disappointing response from the Minister is such a betrayal to the many people who are suffering unnecessarily.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Tory incompetence has created this backlog in cancer treatment.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"The answer is obvious. We need more mobile radiotherapy services, and we need them now. The Minister's decision not to support this boost in radiotherapy services by the APPG on Radiotherapy and ignore my request for a meeting about radiotherapy development at Westmorland General is unnecessarily cruel and disappointing."</em>

<p>I was pleased to support my Parliamentary colleagues in ensuring children are protected from coercion and abuse, through the raising of the age of marriage &amp; civil partnerships in England &amp; Wales from 16 to 18.</p>
<p>The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act 2022, has now come in to force. It means that 16 and 17 year olds will no longer be allowed to marry or enter a civil partnership, even if they have parental consent.</p>
<p>It is now illegal and a criminal offence to exploit vulnerable children by arranging for them to marry under any circumstances whether or not force is used.</p>
<p>The change will crack down on forced marriages which can cause lasting damage on a child and forms part of the government’s continued commitment to tackle violence against women and girls.</p>

<p>I have received the letter below from the Secretary of State for Education regarding the Special Needs and Disabilities (SEND) and Alternative Provision Plan for England.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the need to deliver a more positive experience for children and young people with SEND and make it easier for their families to obtain the support they need for their children. The Improvement Plan sets out how it will achieve this through a single national SEND and alternative provision system.</p>
<p>I know from my constituents who have children with SEND that is often difficult to navigate the system to access support and I also know how the children flourish when they do get the service they need. I am always happy to help where parents are finding it difficult to get the right support.</p>

<p>I passionately believe that it must be the government’s utmost priority to ensure that no matter where you are from or what stage of life you are at, every child and young person should always be able to get a high-quality education and receive the right support in the right place at the right time – and this is particularly pertinent for children and young people with SEND or those in alternative provision.</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that today the Department for Education and Department of Health and Social Care have jointly published the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) and Alternative Provision Improvement Plan for England (SEND and alternative provision improvement plan &#8211; GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).</p>
<p>Publication of the Improvement Plan marks our response to the 16-week consultation period on the proposals set out in the SEND and alternative provision green paper. Through this consultation period we attended 175 events and heard from over 4,500 people, as well as receiving thousands of responses to the consultation.</p>
<p>I would like to put on record our thanks to all children, young people, and their families, organisations and sector groups across education, health and care who have provided feedback including via the SEND and alternative provision green paper e-consultation and through our consultation events.</p>
<p>It is time to deliver a more positive experience for children and young people with SEND and to restore families’ confidence in the system. The Improvement Plan sets out how we will achieve this through a single national SEND and alternative provision system with the mission to fulfil children’s potential, build parents’ trust and provide financial sustainability. New National Standards will improve early identification of needs and set clear expectations for the types of evidence-based support that should be available in mainstream settings, to give parents confidence in the support that should be made available for their child.</p>
<p>To deliver the National Standards in local areas, new local SEND and alternative provision partnerships will create evidence-based local inclusion plans that will set out how the needs of children and young people in the area will be met. These plans will be in line with the National Standards and the vision for alternative provision. By improving early identification and the quality of support, we expect that more children and young people will have their needs met consistently through ordinarily available provision in their mainstream setting, preventing escalation of need that pushes some children to Education, Health and Care Plans.</p>
<p>For children and young people who need a plan, we will reduce bureaucracy by introducing new standardised plans and supporting local authorities to use digital technology consistently. Our investment into specialist and alternative provision places, including opening 33 new special free schools with 49 in the pipeline, means that more children will have timely access to the right support in their local area. A three-tier alternative provision system will focus on targeted early support in mainstream schools, time-limited intensive placements in an alternative provision setting, and longer-term placements to support returns to mainstream or to sustainable post-16 destinations.</p>
<p>We know how important an expert workforce is in supporting children and young people with SEND or in alternative provision to fulfil their potential. We will invest in the workforce across education, health and care to build the capacity of the specialist workforce and to improve confidence and expertise in supporting children and young people with SEND promptly and effectively. This includes funding up to 5,000 early years staff to gain an accredited Level 3 early years SENCO qualification. To increase the capacity of specialists, we will use a £21 million investment to train two cohorts of educational psychologists between 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>To help build parents’ trust we will strengthen accountabilities, with every partner held to account, including through the new Ofsted/CQC Area SEND Inspection. From autumn 2023, local and national inclusion dashboards will provide increased transparency to parents.</p>
<p>To help all children and young people to lead healthy and fulfilled adult lives, we will support young people into employment including investing £18 million between 2022 and 2025 to double the capacity of the Supported Internships programme. These are complemented by the Adjustment Passports we already produce with the Department for Work and Pensions, to support young people with SEND to enter work.</p>
<p>Children and young people can only get the right support within a system where costs are managed effectively. An over 50% increase in high needs funding to over £10 billion by 2023-24, compared to £6.1 billion in 2018-19, will help children and young people with SEND in both special schools and mainstream schools receive the right support. We are working hard with local authorities to improve services and address deficits, including through the existing Safety Valve programme, which has already helped authorities begin implementing plans to reform their high needs systems for the benefit of children and young people. We are also continuing to invest, through an additional £2 billion a year, from this April, secured in the Autumn statement. Of this, £400 million has been earmarked for special educational needs and disabilities and alternative provision.</p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver a system that is more responsive to the needs of individual children. To make sure we get this right we will use our £70 million Change Programme to establish up to nine Regional Expert Partnerships who will help us co-produce, test and refine key reforms.</p>
<p>The steps in the Improvement Plan cannot be delivered by government alone and local system leaders can start now in learning from and adopting good practice that already exists across the country. We look forward to working in collaboration with system leaders, parents and families, directly and through a National Board that will be co-chaired by Claire Coutinho, the Minister for Children, Families and Wellbeing and Maria Caulfield, the Minister for Mental Health and Women’s Health Strategy. It is important that we work together to deliver a single national system that delivers consistently for every child and young person with SEND and in alternative provision.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me should you want any further detail.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
Rt Hon Gillian Keegan MP<br />
Secretary of State for Education</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="http://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://nottinghamlabour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cllr-Adele-Williams-Official-Photo-2017-150x150.jpg" alt="Adele Williams deputy leader headshot portrait" class="wp-image-2986"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cllr Adele Williams, Deputy Leader and Portfolio Holder for Finance</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nottingham City Council has passed a balanced budget. This is a legal requirement but it is made more difficult each year after more than a decade of Tory cuts. We have a Prime Minister who has boasted about taking money from places like ours: ‘We inherited a bunch of formulas from Labour that shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas and that needed to be undone. I started the work of undoing that’.</p>



<p>And that has happened under the Tories. Revenue Support Grant was cut from £126.8m a decade ago to £26.7m last year. This is the equivalent of £694 lost for every household in Nottingham – and £945 in real terms. This has been coupled with rampant inflation and rising costs of energy, good and contracts &#8211; partially due to the budget under the doomed leadership of Liz Truss. All of this is happening at a time when demand for services such as   Housing Aid or social care is increasing.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson promised to ‘fix adult social care once and for all’ with a plan he had prepared, but he hasn’t fixed it once and for all – he hasn’t fixed it at all. The Prime Minister’s deliberate strategy of taking money from Nottingham, and Johnson’s unsurprising failure to make good on his promise have landed further burdens on Nottingham people.</p>



<p>These same factors have made it hard for all councils to come to a balanced budget. In Birmingham and Edinburgh there were gaps of £80 million to overcome. In the Conservative-controlled Kent County Council it was £50 million, while it was £34.8 million rising to £73.8 over three years for our closest neighbours in Nottinghamshire.</p>



<p>Nottingham was not alone in having to close a large gap. Whilst we have had to make difficult decisions we have worked to protect what Nottingham needs and values and have remained ambitious for our city and the people of Nottingham. Our budget backs the people of Nottingham and positions Nottingham as a city fit for the future.</p>



<p>It was disappointing to see that the opposition did not put forward a credible budget amendment – or indeed, one with numbers. The joint Conservative and Independents’ amendment showed the true colours of the Independents, and the lack of attention to detail of both groups.</p>



<p>Like nearly every council across the country we have had to raise council tax, but for average paid, we are amongst the lowest charging councils – the 45th lowest of 309 councils in the country. For 80% of Nottingham, the most they will pay extra is £1.46 a week, and we encourage people to see whether they are eligible for the council tax reduction scheme, for which £27.8 million has been allocated. We know that any rise, even below inflation is difficult, but like councils across England, we have been forced by the choices government has made to take this course to continue to provide the outstanding services that the people of Nottingham deserve.</p>



<p>Services like our outstanding council run care homes, supporting Nottingham residents when they most need it.</p>



<p>Services like our Libraries, which we have maintained while building a new library in Sherwood and continuing work on the central Library which will open this year and will provide a leading children library for the youngest residents in our city.</p>



<p>Nottingham people have a public transport network that is the envy of other cities, where we can expect to be within a short walk of a regular bus or tram service, and we go above and beyond on concessionary passes in our city. Our Carbon Neutral approach addresses both the climate crisis, and the holes in household budgets, with our pioneering work in energy saving, our outstanding public transport and our CN28 targets that place Nottingham as a pioneering council that other authorities wish to learn from.</p>



<p>We have worked hard to maintain and improve these services while still having a balanced budget. Nottingham is a great place to grow up and grow old in, thanks to the work we have done and will continue to do. We also promise Nottingham people that we will work for a Labour government that will deliver what Nottingham people need. May’s local elections are our next opportunity to send a message to this government through the ballot box – and to elect Labour councillors who continue to work hard for what Nottingham needs now and in the future.</p>

<p>Loganair have taken the decision to temporarily suspend services from Inverness to Stornoway, Benbecula, Kirkwall and Sumburgh, and between Kirkwall and Sumburgh due to the industrial action. Starting on Friday 17 March up to and including 30 April, no Loganair services will fly from the islands to Inverness. This could be extended into May.</p>



<p>Mr MacNeil said: “We cannot have a situation where these lifeline services are suspended, which will cause enormous disruption to island communities, and a resolution must be found.</p>



<p>“This will be especially difficult for those going to hospital in Inverness and those working in the oil industry. It will mirror the difficulty many constituents have come to me with accessing the hospital in Stornoway from Uist and particularly Barra when the Comhairle walked away from its transport commitments when it cut flights a number of years back. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This situation will affect even more people than the Comhairle&#8217;s flight axe.”</p>

<p>This year’s mass campaign, from 17th March to 2nd April, brings together individuals, community organisations, businesses, and councils to make a difference to the environment on our doorstep - and the charity is keen to stress litter-picking can be accessible to everybody with the right resources.</p>

<p>Residents can show pride in their area by pledging on Keep Britain Tidy’s website to pick a bag or more of litter, helping make a huge difference to the environment.</p>

<p>As well as being good for the environment, after the 2022 campaign, 85% of people who took part said they felt more pride for their local area.</p>

<p>A post campaign survey of participants also shows 71% agreed or strongly agreed that they feel more a part of their local community and 69% agreed or strongly agreed that they are more aware of the litter issues in their local area.</p>

<p>Commenting on the campaign Philip Dunne MP, who collects litter regularly, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As well as polluting our streets, parks and beaches, litter harms wildlife, domestic pets, and cattle. </p>

<p>“Between 2019 and 2020, the RSPCA dealt with 8,092 calls concerning animals being injured or caught up in general litter – an average of 11 incidents per day.</p>

<p>“The Great British Spring Clean, now in its eighth year, will see people up and down the country come together. I hope it will do even better than last year when nearly half a million bags of litter were collected.</p>

<p>“This year’s campaign is supported by media partner Clear Channel, as well as traders who are very aware that their packaging  can be part of the problem, namely KFC, McDonald’s, Nestlé, Mars Wrigley, Coca-Cola, Walkers, and Pepsi MAX. Also players of the People’s Postcode Lottery have raised funds to support this campaign”.</p>

              <h3>Martin Docherty (West Dunbartonshire)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>West Dunbartonshire’s MP Martin Docherty-Hughes is calling on NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde Health Board to improve support for those who have experienced miscarriage.</p>



<p>The local MP is backing a campaign by the SNP’s Angela Crawley for all health boards in Scotland to sign up to the Miscarriage Association’s Pregnancy Loss Pledge.</p>



<p>By signing the pledge, employers commit to a higher pregnancy loss standard to ensure that employees going through what can be a very difficult or traumatic time get the support and time off they need.</p>



<p>Already, 11 health trusts in England and Wales have signed up to the initiative but, so far, none of Scotland’s 12 regional health boards have.</p>



<p>The call comes ahead of the second reading of the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3312">Miscarriage Leave Bill</a> in the House of Commons, due later this month. The Private Members’ Bill, brought forward by Angela Crawley MP, seeks to introduce a statutory right for three days paid leave in the event of a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or molar pregnancy.</p>



<p>One in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, however, under current legislation, workers are only entitled to paid bereavement leave following a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>



<p>As a result, families across the country are forced to rely on their employer’s good will or sick leave to allow them to grieve their loss.</p>



<p>SNP MPs have been campaigning for the UK government to give all parents the legal right to paid leave if a miscarriage occurs before 24 weeks.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting, Martin Docherty-Hughes MP said:</strong></p>



<p>“I know many families in West Dunbartonshire and beyond who have experienced the pain of pregnancy loss.</p>



<p>“Miscarriage can be a traumatic experience but it’s not an illness. Parents shouldn’t be forced to take sick leave to grieve their loss.</p>



<p>“The Miscarriage Association&#8217;s Pregnancy Loss Pledge seeks to improve the care and support that is available to those who have experienced miscarriage.</p>



<p>“It’s an important campaign which I’m proud to support. I hope NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde and all of Scotland’s health boards commit to the Pregnancy Loss Pledge.”</p>



<p><strong>SNP MP Angela Crawley added:</strong></p>



<p>“Hundreds of businesses, both big and small, have already signed up which means thousands of workers across the UK know that they will be supported by their employer should they experience miscarriage.</p>



<p>“I would encourage every health board in Scotland to take the Pregnancy Loss Pledge to ensure that their employees are supported through what can be an incredibly tough time both mentally and physically.</p>



<p>“Not only will this enhance their current policies for staff who experience bereavement but they will also be doing their bit in tackling the stigma associated with miscarriage.”</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, donned a cape, tiara and flashing tie to become a Teal Hero to raise awareness for Ovarian Cancer Month.</p>
<p>Ovarian Cancer Month runs throughout the whole of March, and aims to raise awareness of ovarian cancers and the symptoms women should look out for. Each year, Target Ovarian Cancer and the APPG on Ovarian Cancer hold an event in Westminster called &#8216;Teal Heroes&#8217;. Teal is the colour linked to ovarian cancer, and the campaign encourages Members of Parliament to get involved.</p>
<p>4,182 women die of ovarian cancer each year, with nearly 7,500 being diagnosed. Two thirds of women in England are diagnosed once the cancer has already spread.</p>
<p><strong>The four key symptoms of Ovarian Cancer are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having a bloated tummy</li>
<li>Experiencing tummy pain</li>
<li>Always feeling full</li>
<li>Needing to wee more often.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commenting on the campaign Gwynne, who lost his mother to Ovarian Cancer, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Thanks to Target Ovarian Cancer for giving me another opportunity to become a Teal Hero. This one’s for you Mum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;29 years ago, I lost my beautiful Mum to Ovarian Cancer. It’s so important that we raise awareness of this devastating killer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, if you’re having any symptoms, speak to your GP.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The power sharing agreement in Northern Ireland collapsed many months ago and this has been caused, in part, by the agreement struck between Boris Johnson and the European Union over goods entering and leaving the island of Ireland post-Brexit. Rishi Sunak recently announced a new deal agreed with the EU. The hope of the UK Government is that this will bring the communities of Northern Ireland and their parties back into Stormont and ensure a functioning Assembly returns. As chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ireland and the Irish in Britain, I am glad to see the UK Government taking steps to resolve this situation and noting the importance of the Good Friday Agreement. It is important that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are respected. This must include protecting North-South working relationships and East-West relationships.</p>
<p>There was a debate this week in Parliament on the Tories failure to train and retain enough staff to tackle the worst workforce crisis in the history of the NHS. We currently have a shortage of 9,000 hospital doctors and a staggering 47,000 nurses. Many constituents will be aware that I spent most of my career before becoming an MP in NHS management roles and so am acutely aware of the issues facing the NHS. NHS managers are not always popular, but are critical to having an effective and efficient service. It is not the time to cull local mangers as Health Secretaries often call for. The NHS is facing industrial relations at an all-time low, capacity and demand massively out of kilter, a physical estate that is literally crumbling, £10 billion-worth of backlogs, and unsurprisingly, morale at dangerously low levels. For too long the Tories have valued inputs into the NHS over patient outcomes. We must put the public, patients and managers at the heart of NHS decision making so we can improve outcomes for all.</p>
<p>The Tories like to push the narrative that the NHS is too broken to fix. But we all that the reality is the Tories are too broken to fix the NHS. We have to start with staff. Exhausted and demoralised staff deserve much better. We need to train more nurses, health care assistants, midwives, doctors to ensure staffing levels can cope with the demand. Then managers and staff can work together to figure out the issues that they face locally – whether it’s a prevalence of falls among the elderly, harmful use of alcohol, or excess weight management – and to put in place the measures that will support them deal with demand.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I’ve long campaigned for improvements to trailer safety on our roads. Sadly, the Tories recently ripped up safety regulations. This week the Government published a report into trailer compliance. It showed that of the 3,083 trailers that were checked, 50% were non-compliant and 41% had issues that would require immediate repairs before they could be used on the roads again. Because of the changes in law, drivers without towing training are now free to roam the roads. With non-compliance rates in trailers so high this is a recipe for disaster for road safety. I warned them at the time and now the evidence has proved us correct. We must have better trailer safety – too many lives are being needlessly put at risk for something that is easily rectified. We all expect cars on the road to be MOT’d to protect other road users and they are removed if they are found to be defective. It should be the same with trailers.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was honoured to be elected a vice-chair at the AGM of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Rare, Genetic and Undiagnosed Diseases. I am a vice-chair for the APPG for PKU, a rare disease which does not allow sufferers to digest protein. The APPG for PKU and the National Society for PKU (NSPKU) has campaigned for over 7 years for NICE to approve, and make available medical treatment for PKU. At the end of 2021, NHS England announced that Kuvan would be available for patients of all ages. In 2022, NHS Wales announced a similar policy. The Rare Diseases APPG discussed its plans for 2023, which includes the coordination of care and access to medicines for rare conditions, and monitoring of the implementation of Rare Disease Action Plans in each of the UK nations. After the AGM was completed, we heard from speakers who have been involved in Rare Diseases. Nick Meade, Genetic Alliance UK, gave us an update on the implementation of the Rare Diseases Frameworks. Tony Thornburn, Behcets UK, (Behcets is an inflammatory disorder that affects multiple parts of the body) who spoke about patient registries for rare conditions, and highlighted that there are 114 registries which need collating. Tony believes that true collegiate working in the medical arena is vital, but this doesn’t happen, as shown by his frustration at trying to establish a patient Registry for Behcets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Professor Adrian Williams, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust spoke about optimum clinical pathways for adults with neurological conditions and the value of care pathways. Alice Fabre, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Newborn Screening Alliance, spoke about its mission to achieve the earliest possible introduction of newborn screening for SMA in the UK, which will deliver the best outcomes from treatment and reduce future healthcare costs. Every 5 days in the UK a baby is born with SMA, which is a devastating genetic condition. Without treatment it is a leading cause of infant death. Earlier treatment before onset of symptoms is critical and newborn screening is the fastest route to a diagnosis of SMA. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the APPG for Flooding we heard from Tracey Garrett, CEO of the National Flood Forum NFF, which supports flooded people and communities through its website, helpline available around the clock during flood episodes, and recovery work in communities where people are putting their lives back together. The NFF longer term work is helping flood action groups in communities to work with flood risk management agencies to create solutions and plans to mitigate flood risk. The economic impact of flooding is estimated at £1.3bn a year. The national risk register places flooding second to pandemics or biological attacks. The Environment Agency (EA) found that 5.2m properties are at risk of flooding in the UK. Rural communities and smaller areas within large urban conurbations are particularly hit by repeated flooding. Each flooding episode has financial, physical, and emotional impacts, which are compounded after multiple floodings. Many areas do not meet the Flood Defence Grant in Aid (FDGiA) criteria and are therefore unlikely to be considered for capital schemes. FDGiA is the UK Government fund for managing flood risk and provides funding for EA management studies, and local authority flood risk and coastal erosion management studies and projects. Natural Resources Wales is responsible for administering this in Wales. Communities that have flooded cannot access this funding directly, but have to apply to a Risk Management Authority to lead a bid on their behalf, which is difficult, time consuming and Lead Local Funding Authorities do not have the resources, so many funding bids are prioritised, and many communities miss out. In 2022, the UK Government announced a package of £100m to be used for 80 schemes for frequently flooded people, but the details have not yet been released. Heather Shepherd, Head of Engagement at NFF, spoke about the trauma, anxiety, and physical exhaustion of flooding; managing jobs, family, insurance claims, finding alternative accommodation, packing up the house contents; children’s education; disability and current illness; impact on extended family and friends; recovering a normal lifestyle; and the resilience needed to cope with repeated flooding. The NFF would like Parliamentarians to challenge the FDGiA criteria; support the need for more funding and research into the human aspects of repeated flooding; and promote local schemes that don’t match the business case for FDGiA to highlight the need for reform. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As vice-chair of the APPG on the Environment, I attended a roundtable discussion with environmental experts – Jean Blaylock, Global Justice Now; Amandine Van de Berghe, Client Earth; Ben Westerman, Aldersgate Group; and Jonny Peters, E3G – to discuss the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), and the UK’s relationship with it, which will be decided at a summit in April. The ECT is an investment agreement between 50 countries dating back to 1990, specifically for the energy sector. At that time the focus was on access to gas and oil reserves in former Soviet countries where levels of climate ambition was not high. The purpose of the ECT is to protect foreign investments from regulatory or political interference, but the Treaty includes arbitration panels capable of awarding multimillion dollar compensation through Investor State Dispute Settlements (ISDS). An ISDS is used by fossil fuel companies to sue governments for policies which protect the climate and environment. In 2018, a negotiation to remodel the ECT was launched with the objective to align with the Paris Agreement and to achieve a consensus on the main principles by 24th June 2022. But despite attempts to reform, the ECT continues to undermine global climate action and several countries have announced their intention to withdraw from the ECT. Italy has left, and France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands have said they intend to leave. This month, a group of experts wrote to the U.K. Government’s Energy and Net Zero Secretary urging the UK to leave the ECT. There was agreement between the experts that the ECT is holding back investment in green energy, is costly, and a risk to governments who want to implement green policies. Because several governments have been sued for millions under the treaty, there is a “chilling effect” of the fear of being sued, and this is allowing fossil fuel operations to continue. The UK Government is sitting on a fence – modernisation is not its high priority. Modernisation requires three quarters of the countries in the ECT to ratify change, and there have been no arbitration cases against countries who have left the treaty. The UK needs to leave now so that it can lead on shaping the future legal issues on how to withdraw. The EU supports withdrawal and if the UK doesn’t act now, it will not be included as part of these plans. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the AGM of the APPG on Archives and History, I was pleased to be re-elected as a vice-chair. We have some exciting events planned for 2023, including a roundtable of famous US commentators speaking about the 60th anniversary of the assassination of JFK – who was murdered </span><span class="s2">on 22nd November 1963</span><span class="s1"> in Dallas Texas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There were two “State of the UK Rescue” events organised by the All Party Parliamentary Advisory Welfare Group, of which I am a vice-chair. At the drop-in event, we met some of the rescue dogs, and learned about the factors affecting rescue organisations and shelters during the cost-of-living crisis. I met my old friend Vanessa Walden, who runs Hope Rescue in Llanharan. We have worked together campaigning to ban greyhound racing in the UK. Vanessa secured a petition to ban greyhound racing in Wales which was supported by the Senedd Petitions Committee and Welsh Government Minister Lesley Griffiths. The committee’s recommendations to ban greyhound racing will be debated in the Senedd </span><span class="s2">on 8th March</span><span class="s1">. I had my photo taken with a little rescue dog called Charlie. I also attended the “State of the U.K. Rescue” open discussion event with speakers from across the world of dog welfare. The event was so well supported that there wasn’t a seat left in the largest committee room in Westminster, and the discussion lasted for over three hours. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“<a href="https://walesweek.london/">Wales Week London</a>” was founded in 2016 by Dan Langford OBE, and it now lasts way before and way beyond its original week organised around St David’s Day. This year it extends </span><span class="s2">from 19th February to 5th March</span><span class="s1">. I am honoured to be the chair of the APPG for Wales in the World, and we held a meeting to coincide with Wales Week London. The theme of the meeting was “Welsh Export Champions” an initiative created by the Department of International Trade (DIT) Wales to discover and recruit businesses in Wales who are prepared to promote the benefits of exporting and to encourage other companies to consider selling to overseas markets. Export Champions are able to share their experiences with businesses who are considering venturing into the export market. Tom Taylor, Deputy Director for DIT Wales, provided information on the vast range of support it offers to Welsh businesses and explained free trade agreements and intergovernmental working. We heard from two Export Champions, followed by a presentation and whisky tasting session from Stephen Davies, Managing Director of Penderyn Welsh Whisky, which I listened to but did not partake in having been a teetotaller for over 45 years. However, the other members of the APPG appeared to approve of the selection of Penderyn whisky that Stephen had brought with him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a vice-chair of the APPG on UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), I attended a closed meeting with the Minister for Levelling Up, Dehenna Davison MP, to discuss the review of the first tranche of the UKSPF and what comes next. Many Welsh Labour MPs expressed their concern that the Welsh Government has been removed from running the fund, and that the replacement competitive bids made by local authorities were full of complicated paperwork; there was little time allocated to put together a bid using the mandatory complex UK Government criteria; and the funding window was three years as opposed to seven years (with a possible three year extension) for the previous EU Funding Scheme, so sustainability of the UKSPF is a serious concern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a vice-chair for the APPG for Steel, which is chaired by Stephen Kinnock MP, I attended a meeting to learn about proposals for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in the UK. Gareth Stace, Director of UK Steel, delivered an excellent briefing. Steel is a global commodity intensively traded across borders. While 25% is traded internationally, this climbs to 43% outside China. The UK exports 45% of steel production and imports 60% of steel direct requirements. Mechanisms such as emissions trading and carbon pricing taxing domestic producer’s emissions create an uneven playing field when countries exporting to the UK have not faced comparable policies. Therefore, decarbonising steel production, passing on the additional cost of decarbonisation to steel customers, means UK producers are being outcompeted by high-carbon emission steel imported from abroad. CBAM is needed to level out Domestic and International producers. It would impose a carbon tariff equivalent to domestic carbon prices so that domestic and international producers face similar carbon costs. The EU has agreed to introduce a CBAM policy, initially implementing reporting requirements from October 2023 before the CBAM tariff applies from 2026 onwards. Free allowances will be gradually phased out towards 2034, and EU producers will then face the full carbon price. When exporting steel to the EU, non EU steel makers will buy a CBAM certificate corresponding to the amount of emissions generated in the production of their goods, which is priced according to the average weekly price of UK Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) auctions. The UK’s carbon prices have increased to historical highs costing the steel industry an estimated £125m in compliance costs for 2022. Carbon costs are curtailing steel production and undermining competitiveness of UK steel production, and eating into capital investment for decarbonisation. The impact of the EU CBAM could be substantial, and where will the steel currently being exported to the EU go if faced with a tariff. Will it be diverted to the UK, flood the British market and depress prices. Whilst UK producers may initially be exempt, once EU free allowances are reduced, EU and UK producers will face different effective carbon prices, and UK producers will have to buy CBAM certificates resulting in a trade barrier to our biggest export market. And it is not known how CBAM will operate in Northern Ireland. HM Treasury has announced that it intends to consult on carbon leak measures in Spring 2023, including CBAM and product standards. But its implementation would be after the EU CBAM is operational, leaving the UK steel industry exposed. </span></p>

<p>In a TV debate last week, I almost fell off the chair when the Tory MP claimed hers was the party of law and order.</p>



<p>Recorded crime has hit a 20 year high, with over 6.3 million crimes but a mere 5.6% resulting in prosecution. One of the more sickening statistics is that only 1.3% of rape cases end with a suspect in the dock.</p>



<p>Vehicle crime is at record levels, yet was almost eradicated because of higher police numbers and initiatives Labour pursued with insurance companies and car manufacturers. Today, vehicle theft and ‘car cannibalism’ is carried out in broad daylight. A criminal market is developing because of a shortage of vehicle parts, due to supply chain problems the Tories have been unable to fix.</p>



<p>Like most of my constituents, I’m fed up with poor responses from the police and low arrest outcomes, but I don’t blame the police. They’re stretched to breaking point. We now have reactive policing which takes place after a crime has been committed, rather than neighbourhood policing which is based on an intelligence gathering and deterrence approach designed to prevent crime.</p>



<p>As well as boosting police numbers, the last Labour government also focused on anti social behaviour because we recognise it is often the starting point for more serious crime. We introduced ASBOs, special courts and ASB prosecutors, but Tory cuts have taken their toll. We lost 20,000 police officers and although there’s been a belated effort to replace some, it’s hard to retain and recruit good people when pay and conditions are so much poorer than parts of the private sector.</p>



<p>Present day Tories have no claim to be the party of law and order. They’ve decimated the police, butchered our courts and made life easy for criminals. Labour knows what to do because we’ve done it before. The answer lies in more police, faster justice, better sentences and targeted policies for ASB, car crime, assaults, sexual offences and burglary. On crime, we will turn the clock back. Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.</p>

<p><strong>Local MP Grant Shapps opened the Generation Welwyn Hatfield Careers Fair during a constituency day last week.</strong><br><br>The event was organised by Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council and Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership to showcase the wide variety of opportunities that are available to young people who are interested in pursuing a non-traditional career path.</p>



<p>During his opening speech, Mr Shapps talked from personal experience about how important it is for more practical career opportunities to be presented to students:<br><br>“I am probably the only cabinet member without a degree, and I didn’t do A-levels either which goes to show you don’t have to take a traditional path to achieve your goals.&#8221; </p>



<p>Hundreds of students from schools across Hertfordshire had the opportunity to network with a wide variety of businesses and organisations, ranging from Barclays Bank to the Royal Air Force.</p>



<p>A student shared their experience of the event: “I feel like this is an opportunity for students that you wouldn’t normally get, and it has helped me get to know work experiences and apprenticeships that will help us with our future.” <br><br>Mr Shapps was thrilled to have been invited to open the day and thoroughly enjoyed speaking to all the businesses and students. He wishes all those who attended the best of luck and success for the future.</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">Nicola Sturgeon shared some of her favourite images from her time as First Minister on social media. At the top of her list was a picture of herself in the centre of a large crowd on Inverness High Street during her 2015 election campaign. On that day, she spent her time speaking to locals, young and old. Despite the demands on her time, I recall that no one who wanted a photo, handshake, or just a chat left disappointed. It was a testament to her character that she went out of her way to reach out to those in wheelchairs or those who found themselves on the sidelines to say hello and inquire about them. I remember thinking that she was a tough act to follow in daily life, let alone as a leader.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When I was the Council leader, I worked closely with her on the Inverness City Region deal. Our Highland deal was the first after the 2015 election, and her government&#8217;s funding of £135 million was in stark contrast to the £53 million from the UK government. Many people have benefited from her decision to prioritise funding to ensure that nobody pays the awful Bedroom Tax and the introduction of Social Security Scotland. Then there is the Baby Box, the £25 per child per week Scottish child payment, a variety of support for carers. Our young people have access to free bus travel when needed as they embark on their journey, and they do not have to pay tuition fees to access further education. And that&#8217;s just scratching the surface.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard the news of her resignation, I was as shocked as anyone, but I understood her decision. Politics can be a harsh environment. People are always looking for an opportunity to attack, which can be tough on politicians, who are human beings with families and emotions. The relentless pressure on Nicola must have been overwhelming. She has remained resilient and always maintained a good sense of humour and grace. We must now move forward, thanking her for her leadership these past eight years, not least during the dark days of the pandemic. We will have new political leadership and a new voice to build on her legacy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much talent to choose from in the SNP, and I look forward to the leadership debate and continuing to seek to expand opportunities for the Highlands and Scotland.</p>

<p>Many pensioners across Carmarthenshire may be losing out on vital Pension Credit help that could bring an average of £2,700 extra into their homes every year.</p>



<p>An estimated
£5million worth of Pension Credit annually goes unclaimed in the county which
during this cost of living crisis could be used by local people to help make
ends meet.&nbsp; It is a nationwide problem
too with one million households thought to be affected.</p>



<p>Pension Credit
provides extra cash to those who are over State Pension age and on low incomes.&nbsp; It is separate from the State Pension and you
might be able to qualify even if you have other income, savings or if you’re a
homeowner.&nbsp; It can also act as a
“gateway” benefit which opens doors to additional help with housing costs,
council tax, TV licences and more.</p>



<p>It is the most
underclaimed benefit of all and around a quarter of those eligible to claim do
not do so, missing out on support.&nbsp; </p>



<p>That is why I’m
determined to encourage as many local residents who think they might qualify to
apply.&nbsp; </p>



<p>I recently held
an event at the Selwyn Samuel Centre to raise awareness of Pension Credit which
attracted over 150 people, with experts from the Citizens Advice Bureau, DWP
and other organisations on hand to help.&nbsp;
Anyone who thinks that they, or a loved one, may be eligible for Pension
Credit should find out more about it as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Claims can be
made online at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/pension">www.gov.uk/pension</a> credit or by phone on 0800 99 1234. &nbsp;If you need help in submitting a claim then my
office is happy to assist and can put you in contact with a specialist advisor to
take you through the process.&nbsp; Please get
in touch on 01554 756374 or email <a href="mailto:nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk">nia.griffith.mp@parliament.uk</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my February email newsletter. It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks since the start of the year in Parliament, and I&#8217;ve been pleased to raise local and national issues in the House on issues such as pensions, road improvements and recycling/waste changes, which you can find more about below. I&#8217;ve also included some local updates on projects such as the Heanor High Streets Fund works and the long-awaited installation of step-free access at Alfreton, as well as access to health appointments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there are any issues you&#8217;d like to discuss further or that I can help with, please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch via the contact details at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>War in Ukraine – President Zelensky visit</u></strong></p>



<p>In Westminster we had the great honour of welcoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to give an address to parliament. He spoke about bravery when faced with the horrors of war, praising the courage of the men and women in Ukraine who are defending their country, and highlighting how the people of the United Kingdom embody these values themselves. It was a moving yet tongue-in-cheek speech, demonstrating that the Ukrainians share the classically British sense of humour in the face of adversity.</p>



<p>We should be incredibly proud of the support we have given to Ukraine, and the impact that we have made in helping them to defend their country. I wholeheartedly support the Government’s efforts to support Ukraine, and the equipment and training which has been provided to the Ukrainian military. It is right that the United Kingdom continues to stand up for freedom and democracy on the world stage, and to defend these values as we have done before.</p>



<p>I will be speaking to Radio Derby about the war in Ukraine as part of their coverage of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion.</p>



<p><strong><u>Pensions debates update</u></strong></p>



<p>We’ve certainly had the time to cover pensions over the last few weeks in the House of Commons. As part of my role on the Work and Pensions Committee, I’ve had the chance to speak at length in a number of debates on various aspects of pensions, and the future of our pension system.</p>



<p>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February, I chaired a Backbench Business debate on State Pension Age. We had cross-party consensus in favour of postponing a further increase to the state pension age, and discussions were had on life-expectancy in the UK. I argued the case that any further increases must consider differing effects of manual vs professional workers, and high-earners vs those who earn the least. Given the consensus against a further increase to 68, I urged the Government to factor our discussion into their upcoming review of the State Pension Age.</p>



<p>On the 6<sup>th</sup> of February, the House of Commons debated the plans to uprate pensions and benefits with inflation. I spoke strongly in favour of benefits and pensions increasing by 10% in line with inflation and argued further that there needs to be a review to work out whether the benefits and pensions given to individuals across the UK are in line with their expected living costs. Families and pensioners relying on Government support should be given enough to cover their basic needs and housing costs.</p>



<p>Finally, on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February, I attended a debate in Westminster Hall on protecting pension savers. Our discussion focused on ensuring self-employed people, gig-economy workers, full-time carers and women are all protected and supported in saving sufficiently for retirement. These groups have historically found it more difficult to save, and discussions were had on how to protect and improve their pensions. I spoke repeatedly about reforms to protect these vulnerable groups, and also on the Government new plans for an online dashboard, which will help people more easily track and plan their pension savings.</p>



<p>There are a number of changes on the way to modernise and improve the pension system, and to ensure not only that pensioners are appropriately supported in retirement, but that people are easily able to track their pensions and empowered to save sufficiently for their futures.</p>



<p>I am proud to be a part of these ongoing discussions about our pension system and the support provided to pensioners in the UK and you can find my recent contributions in the House in these debates in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-02-07b.247.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g251.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>APPG Cleaning &amp; Hygiene update</u></strong></p>



<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of January I chaired a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cleaning and Hygiene. It was enlightening to speak to professionals working in cleaning services and the manufacturing of cleaning products about the industry and its importance in supporting out NHS and preventing the spread of disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was happy to be joined in this meeting by John Hines from SC Johnson Professional, who have a manufacturing plant in Denby.</p>



<p>The group was able to discuss our recent report on the role which the cleaning and hygiene industry can plan in pandemic resilience and response, as well as supporting the NHS and reducing the spread of winter flu. One of the outcomes of the report was to encourage people continue the good habits we all developed during the pandemic, which will help keep our homes and families safer and healthier.</p>



<p><strong><u>Junction 28 improvement works debate</u></strong></p>



<p>Whilst Junction 28 of the M1 isn’t directly in Amber Valley, the delays currently caused at peak times as a result of the daily congestion in this area regularly back up into our area, sometimes as far as Alfreton and Swanwick.</p>



<p>Neighbouring MP, Mark Fletcher, within whose Bolsover constituency J28 lies, is campaigning for a capacity upgrade to reduce congestions and delays, and I was pleased to support him and his campaign during a recent Westminster Hall debate in Parliament.</p>



<p>I took the opportunity to raise related issues such as noise from the A38, capacity on the roads and the importance of improvements to Junction 28 to driving growth as well as reducing the problems currently being caused.</p>



<p>You can read the debate in full <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2023-01-11b.293.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g297.2">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Recycling &amp; EPR</u></strong></p>



<p>There will be a lot of changes to our waste and recycling systems coming forward over the next few years, to encourage less landfill and more recycling.</p>



<p>As a result, I recently raised a question in Parliament about the introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) for packaging, and the potential impacts of this. You can read my question and the Minister’s reply, as well as the debate in full, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2023-01-30.135354.h&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g135354.q0">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Heanor Future High Streets Fund project update</u></strong></p>



<p>Work is progressing on the Heanor Future High Streets Fund and regeneration projects. I’ve been pleased to join the programme board overseeing progress.</p>



<p>Final designs for the new Heanor marketplace have come forward and these are coming out to consultations on the 21<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> February at St Lawrence Church, as well as being recorded and available on the AVBC website shortly after. If you’d like more information on these, please contact <a href="mailto:regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk">regeneration@ambervalley.gov.uk</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, works is progressing on the plans for the regeneration of the former Heanor Grammar School into the Heanor Hub. The planning application is still live but essential works have been taking place to prevent the further deterioration of the building, with works to the roof and the removal of asbestos. I was pleased to recently visit the Grammar School to have a look around the site.</p>



<p>Finally, the remediation and regeneration of the land at Whysall Street as part of the brownfield regeneration fund is also moving forwards. Surveys have started, and a £1m grant has been secured to tidy up the site prior to turning it into 40 new affordable homes.</p>



<p><strong><u>GP &amp; dental appointments</u></strong></p>



<p>Many constituents have been in touch regarding access to GP and dental appointments. As one specific example, Brooklyn Medical Practice in Heanor has recently moved into the Royal Primary Care Trust.</p>



<p>I’m working to arrange update visits with them and other local GPs and dentists to discuss issues they may be facing, and feed back on issues which have been raised with me by constituents.</p>



<p>I also continue to regularly meet with our local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to discuss updates and hospital treatment updates/waiting lists with them.</p>



<p><strong><u>Access to cash &amp; banking services – new deposit service announced for Ripley</u></strong></p>



<p>I know that access to cash and banking services is an issue many constituents have contacted me about, and whilst I can’t stop banks who sadly decide to close their high street branches, I have been regularly meeting with them to discuss this and maintaining access to banks for residents.</p>



<p>In addition to this, Link and Access to Cash UK are working on new ways to maintain banking services in our high streets.</p>



<p>As part of this, I’m pleased that Ripley was recently selected by Link to have a new shared deposit service in the town. This will provide consumers and businesses with convenient and accessible ways to deposit cash even if they cannot visit a bank branch.</p>



<p>I’m scheduling a meeting with Link to discuss this further, as well as access to cash in Amber Valley’s other towns, and I’ll keep you updated. Please let me know if you have any views or suggestions in the meantime though. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Step-free access for Alfreton Station update</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve been in contact with Network Rail to chase updates on the long-awaited Alfreton Station access for all scheme, which is due for completion by April 2024.</p>



<p>Whilst I’m disappointed by the delays to date, I’m pleased by the progress that is now being seen, with work on the various reports and surveys now taking place. For instance, Network Rail are progressing the coal mining, topographical, ecological and drainage surveys which will then inform the final draft designs and plans.</p>



<p>I’m meeting with Network Rail over the next few weeks to get further updates and timetable information, which I’ll update you on in my next newsletter.</p>



<p><strong><u>Shared Prosperity Funding Success &#8211; £2.9 million additional funding for Amber Valley</u></strong></p>



<p>I’m pleased that confirmation has been received that the Borough Council is receiving £2.9 million in Government granting funding through the Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF). This is part of the Levelling Up agenda, and the funding will be spent across Amber Valley over the next few years.</p>



<p>In particular, projects which will receive investment include improvements to our town centres, new community sports and leisure facilities, including investment in our local parks and play areas. There will also be £240k for community and voluntary sector organisations to bid for to support specific projects and improvements.</p>



<p>Specific projects so far confirmed include a new skatepark for Heanor, shop front improvement grants and the installation of solar panels on our local leisure centres.</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with a further update about a number of local issues.</p>
<h2>Draft Local Plan</h2>
<p>Firstly and most importantly for those who live in or adjoining Epsom and Ewell, the Borough Council has now published its draft local plan, setting out where it intends to allow new homes to be built in the coming years.</p>
<p>The plan involves the construction of about 5,000 new homes. Some of this is on uncontroversial brownfield sites, but unfortunately they have not so far adopted my proposals for the redevelopment of the Kiln Lane and Longmead areas. Instead the proposal involves substantial development on green belt sites around Epsom, particularly the Horton farm area, which is the open farm land next to the old hospital site developments.</p>
<p>They now have to consult on the proposals, and I would encourage everyone to read what is planned and to contribute to the consultation. You can find all the details about how to do this via this link, as well as the list of sites which they plan to develop. You have until 19<sup>th</sup> March to respond to the consultation.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/local-plan">www.epsom-ewell.gov.uk/local-plan</a></strong></p>
<p>Please do circulate this to your friends and family locally so that everyone has the opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>It may also be worth conveying your views to your local Residents Association, as it is RA councillors who control Epsom and Ewell and are the decision makers on this.</p>
<h2>Properties for Ukrainian Families</h2>
<p>I have been asked by the local refugee network to explore again whether there are any landlords willing to make properties available to rent to some of the Ukrainian families who have been welcomed into our area. Sadly the war is continuing and many cannot yet hope to return, and they are now working locally and expecting to be here for a while. Many are looking for private accommodation which enables them to move out from the homes of the families who have been kind enough to host them so far. If you can help, please email <a href="mailto:epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com"><strong>epsomrefugeenetwork@gmail.com</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Tree Planting</h2>
<p>Surrey County Council has a programme to plant over a million trees during this decade as part of its environmental strategy. I have been approached by a local resident who has been working to get trees planted in their street about the process for doing this, and asking me to highlight the opportunity for anyone else who is interested. If you would like to get trees in your street, the details of how to do so are here.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/permits-and-licences/planting-trees">www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/permits-and-licences/planting-trees</a></strong></p>
<p>Please though do bear in mind that this does not work in every street, as sometimes trees damage pavements and make it more difficult for elderly and disabled people.</p>
<h2>Make a Difference Awards</h2>
<p>Finally, BBC Radio Surrey has asked me to highlight its “Make a Difference Awards” to celebrate people who have done positive things in the local community over the past year. If there is someone that you know who has done amazing things locally and you would like to nominate them, you can find a full list of categories &#8211; and details of how to nominate someone &#8211; at <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/tJNGCr8AwC86q6L0Iy47DD?domain=bbc.co.uk"><strong>bbc.co.uk/makeadifference</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Nominations are open now and close on 5<sup>th</sup> March at 11:00pm.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>

<p><strong>Boston Borough and East Lindsey District Councils have invited local organisations to submit expressions of interest for the funding.</strong></p>
<p>The UK Shared Prosperity fund and the Rural England Prosperity Fund have awarded £6.14 million and £2.62 million to East Lindsey and Boston respectively.</p>
<p>Welcoming the announcement, MP for Boston and Skegness Matt Warman said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This £8.76 million Shared Prosperity funding to Boston and East Lindsey comes on top of the £70.3 million Town Deals and £22.8 million in Levelling Up Funding and shows the Government&#8217;s commitment to Levelling Up Boston, East Lindsey and Lincolnshire as a whole. It represents a huge vote of confidence in the vision for regeneration and growth put forward by Boston and East Lindsey Councils and the Town Deal boards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The request for expressions of interest for projects meeting the three priorities of this latest fund is a great opportunity for even more local organisations to join in driving innovation, growth and community in our area.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The full bidding guide for the funding and the expression of interest form is available on the Council&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF">http://www.e-lindsey.gov.uk/UKSPF</a> and <a href="http://www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF">www.boston.gov.uk/UKSPF</a>.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Today I joined Alzheimer’s Society Ambassadors Vicky McClure and Dame Arlene Phillips as well as Elliot Colburn MP and Ananga Moonesinghe, who lives with dementia, to deliver an open letter to PM Rishi Sunak at Downing Street, demanding the Government urgently fulfil their promises on dementia.</p>
<p>Launched by leading dementia charity Alzheimer’s Society, the open letter has been signed by over 36,000 members of the public and famous names including Choreographer Dame Arlene Philips and actor Vicky McClure. We were joined at the hand-in by my colleague on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, Vice-Chair Elliot Colburn MP, showing cross-party support. It urges Rishi Sunak to deliver on previous Conservative Party commitments to dementia and not let the UK’s biggest killer fall down the political agenda.</p>
<p>Previous Conservative Prime Ministers have actively committed to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. Now Rishi Sunak must deliver on promises to reform social care, double dementia research funding and release a ten-year plan for dementia which gives the condition the priority it deserves. The 36,000 people who signed the open letter are making themselves clear &#8211; they don’t just want to hear empty promises, they want to see action. People with dementia can’t and won’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates still sitting below pre-pandemic levels, national figures reveal people are waiting up to two years in some areas for a diagnosis, thereby missing out on vital treatment and support. Alzheimer’s Society research also shows three in five people affected by dementia struggled to get social care in the past year, with half of family carers revealing they ended up in crisis, such as rushing their loved one to A&amp;E due to lack of support</p>
<p>The charity is concerned the deepening workforce crisis in social care – with vacancies sitting at 165,000 – risks leaving people with dementia desperate for help while living costs soar. Alzheimer’s Society say it’s more important now than ever for the Government to prioritise dementia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Government has made many commitments on dementia, promising to deliver a ‘visionary ten-year plan’ for dementia, to reform the social care system and double spending on dementia research by 2024.  Alzheimer’s Society says the delivery of these will be transformational for the lives of the 900,000 people living with dementia but calls on the Government to urgently make these a reality to prevent a deepening crisis in dementia care.</p>
<p>This follows the news last year that a new drug, lecanemab, was shown to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this breakthrough will mean little if diagnosis rates remain stagnant and often inaccurate. This treatment works best for people with early Alzheimer’s disease. Without early and accurate diagnosis, we risk hopeful advancements like this having minimal effect.</p>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools and educational institutions to move to a distance learning model. This has had a significant impact on the way education is delivered. Some of the impacts have been positive, while others have been more negative. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of the key impacts of distance learning in education. We&#8217;ll also look at how this new model is likely to evolve in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Define distance learning and its purpose in education</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning is a form of education that takes place between an instructor and students who are not interacting in the same physical location. Distance learning courses typically take place online, where students can access course materials and engage in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/dl/lessonsfrfld.asp">remote lessons</a> with their instructors from the comfort of their own homes. The primary purpose of distance learning is convenience: it gives students the opportunity to pursue studies at any time, from virtually anywhere. Distance learning also allows students to fit an education into otherwise busy lives. Students who may be unable to enroll in <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/campusbased/what.html">campus-based schooling</a> due to geographic obstacles, health issues or obligations such as employment or family care duties all benefit from being able to receive instruction, interact with peers and complete coursework remotely with distance learning courses.</p>



<h2><strong>Describe how distance learning has changed over the years</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, distance learning has evolved from a simple pen pal type of correspondence to a complex online system. Instead of having to wait weeks for someone to return a single letter, now students can communicate almost instantly with teachers and fellow classmates as well as access curricula and educational resources provided by their school. This shift in technology allows instructors to deliver lessons through <a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/teacher-resources/virtual-classroom/">virtual classrooms</a>, use interactive technological tools such as quizzes and videos to engage their students, and offer new ways for pupils to demonstrate their mastery of material. Despite its advantages, the growth of distance learning still faces challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, high levels of student motivation required to succeed in an online course, security issues associated with personal data sharing over the internet, and lower access by underserved communities due to cost or a lack of available technology resources. The field of distance learning is ever growing though, offering increased opportunities for those seeking alternative ways to receive their education</p>



<h2><strong>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning has come a long way since its inception and can offer an excellent alternative to standard coursework writing. In many ways, it is more convenient than traditional studying, as students are able to fit coursework into their daily lives without having to take time off for commuting or attending lectures. Furthermore, distance learning can be particularly useful for learners who have trouble fitting into the traditional classroom setting or who struggle with certain course topics due to lack of face-to-face instruction. However, distance learning also has some drawbacks; most courses require students to have significant levels of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2020/08/25/8-powerful-ways-to-cultivate-extreme-self-discipline/">self-discipline</a> in order to stay motivated while juggling <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/12/14/best-coursework-writing-service-top-5-online-services-for-students/">their coursework</a> with other commitments, and often times course instructors may not be easily accessible if struggles arise during coursework writing. Nonetheless, with proper motivation and preparation distance learning can be great tool for those seeking educational options.</p>



<h2><strong>Offer examples of successful distance learning programs</strong></h2>



<p>Distance learning programs have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators and learners alike explore new ways to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology. Successful distance learning programs can be seen across many different sectors, whether for academic purposes or for professional development. For example, online universities like Open University offer degrees and courses in a variety of different disciplines, allowing learners to complete their degree in an unprecedented amount of time compared to traditional brick-and-mortar universities. Professional organizations like Toastmasters utilize video conferencing tools to offer staff seminars and other training sessions without having to send staff members out of town. These distance learning solutions save organizations time and money while still managing to deliver quality services and instruction.</p>



<h2><strong>Summarize the impact of distance learning in education overall</strong></h2>



<p>The introduction of distance learning in education has profoundly impacted education overall. Through the use of digital tools, teachers have been able to reach more students and expand their classroom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/geographical-boundary">across geographical boundaries</a>. Additionally, it has increased access to educational materials as well as leveled out the playing field among different socioeconomic backgrounds. Distance learning has allowed schools to create innovative ways of teaching and engaging with students. It not only gives teachers the ability to interact directly with students but also provides ways for students to collaborate and connect with their peers from around the world. All in all, distance learning has shown itself to be a powerful tool that can help students receive a better education no matter where they are located or their financial situation.</p>



<p>Though it has been around in some form since the 19th century, distance learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. This is largely due to advances in technology that have made online education more accessible and affordable than ever before. While there are many advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace, there are also some disadvantages to consider. With so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right program for you. But with careful research and planning, you can find an online education option that meets your needs and helps you achieve your educational goals. Are you considering pursuing a degree through distance learning? What are some of the factors you’re taking into consideration?</p>

<p>It was fascinating to visit the vast new Berry Bros warehouse in Andover recently. This family owned business is one of the world&#8217;s oldest and biggest wine merchants and they have just opened a spanking new multi million pound facility on the Andover Business Park. </p>



<p>While much of their business is selling wine, most of it is helping wine buyers and collectors look after their stock, and the warehouse is where it is all stored. As I was shown round, I marvelled at the famous names on the shelves: Lafitte, Latour, Petrus etc. </p>



<p>The Warehouse is chilled to 12 degrees throughout, but happily due to solar panels on the roof, will be carbon neutral. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great vote of confidence in Andover and in the UK wine industry which I hope will continue to lead the world, with possibly the biggest collection of fine wines on the planet, here in North West Hampshire. </p>

<p>Given the very serious nature of the crimes committed, and that the perpetrator pleaded guilty to all 10 offences, I find it very difficult to understand how he was not deemed a serious threat to the public and remanded in custody.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
