I was proud therefore when, alongside other Norfolk MPs and the A47 Alliance, we were able to secure the £300 million of funding for the dualling of the North Tuddenham-Easton stretch of the A47, for which construction is set to begin next year. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There is much work still to be done however, and I continue to work with partners to make the case for the full-dualling of the A47. Proper 21st century road infrastructure would not only improve road safety by widening unsafe single-carriage roads, but also foster economic growth by providing our residents with quick links to jobs in the growing green economy, and by opening up own innovative businesses and institutions, like the Norwich Research Park.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>That’s why I was delighted to attend Baroness Vere’s RIS3 briefing for MPs today – at which the Government set out how it will determine its strategic vision and priorities for the country’s road network over the period 2025-2030, and outlining what objectives their multi-year investment plan will achieve. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rest assured, I will continue to fight for the modern transport links that are vital for our region’s economic prosperity.</span></span></span></p></div>

              <h3>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday in the House of Commons, South Lakes MP Tim Farron voted to cancel Government plans to cut Universal Credit for struggling families in Cumbria.</p>
<p>From the end of September, people on Universal Credit will see their social security payments cut by £20 a week, amounting to over £1,000 a year.</p>
<p>It comes at the same time as the Government are introducing a rise in National Insurance contributions which is set to disproportionately effect low paid workers.</p>
<p>A new report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates that some 4,330 families in Westmorland and Lonsdale will be harmed by the Government's Universal Credit cut.</p>
<p>Last week, Tim joined representatives from local organisations such as South Lakes Housing, Manna House and Cumbria County Council in writing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, urging him to not go ahead with the proposed cut.</p>
<p>Speaking after the vote, Tim said: <em>"It is absolutely despicable that the Government seem determined to slash the incomes of struggling families.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"This move will have devastating effects on people's livelihoods and their mental health.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Whether it's cutting Universal Credit or hiking National Insurance, this Government seem to have got it in for people who work hard but don't earn much money.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"That's why I was proud to vote against it yesterday in Parliament and will continue to fight these plans."</em>

First, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would be increasing National Insurance by 1.25%, a decision that will hit workers and businesses hard in the aftermath of a tremendously difficult year. Next, I watched as the Secretary of State for the DWP announced the suspension of the Triple Lock in a huge blow to pensioners across the country who were promised that this would never happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Political promises matter. They matter not only because having clear political aims is incredibly important when governing, but also because they are a commitment to the people who voted for you that you mean what you say. I had the same argument over Brexit back when I was in the Shadow Cabinet. For me, it should never have been about reopening the argument. A democratic decision had been made and that was that, which is why I refused to vote for a second referendum. Each time a promise or a commitment isn’t kept, another chunk is taken out of the already disintegrating relationship between the public and politicians.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>However, this Government seem unable to recognise that fact. It’s been just under two years since we first saw the Government latch on to the phrase ‘levelling up’ and promise to boost the UK’s most deprived areas. Then came the revelation that the levelling up fund disproportionately benefitted Tory-held areas, and this &#8211; coupled with the planned cut to Universal Credit and lack of catch-up funding for pupils impacted by the pandemic &#8211; has proven that levelling up was just a useful slogan rather than a detailed policy plan.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If I sound angry, it’s because I am. I pride myself on being a practical kind of politician. I’m more than happy to admit when I think I’ve got things wrong, and always willing to work with politicians from any party to get stuff done for the people I represent. I try and see both sides of an issue, and having worked in Government myself, know all too well how tough a job it is. Breaking promise after promise, however, is inexcusable and people in<span class="apple-converted-space"> <span class="markmpsntb9pf">Tameside</span></span><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>deserve better.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I&#8217;m also very worried. The long-term impact of the pandemic has yet to be truly felt, and we face challenging months and years ahead. We must deal with economic uncertainty, educational catch-up, the NHS backlog, the social care crisis, the housing crisis, child poverty and much more. In the face of this formidable list, good Government has never been more important.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We can rebuild better, stronger and fairer than before. To do so, however, promises must start being kept, and proper plans must start being made.</p>

              <h3>John Redwood (Wokingham)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>When I woke up yesterday two thirds of the electrical power we needed was coming from fossil fuels. The wind was light so windfarms were producing little, and photovoltaic was also well down. In common with recent days some electricity was being generated from coal power stations, brought back into use to keep the lights on. The gas stations were much  in demand. As I was penning this I learned that our foolish dependence on imports has been adversely affected by damage to the French interconnector leaving us even more short of power.</p>
<p>Over the last  week as a whole fossil fuels provided more than half our electrical power, and over the last month 47%. Renewables have been down to 13-14% and coal has had to contribute. Low winds are very disruptive to our current and planned mix of energy. Gas continued to keep most of us warm at home when we needed heating.</p>
<p>We now have the official figures for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter the previous year. This shows a similar pattern to more recent events. We came to rely more on gas when as the official document states &#8220;due to colder weather and poor renewable output&#8221; demand for gas driven power surged. Electricity generation needed 17% more gas than in the prior year. We came to rely more on imports as a result, with Norway accounting for around half and LNG around one quarter. Lower wind speeds led to a 16% reduction in renewable generation in thee first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that a unit at Drax, at West Burton and Ratcliffe on Soar are still available to supply electricity from coal in emergencies, though it would be better to make provision to avoid this. Unfortunately this entails importing coal, much of it from Russia, which is neither environmentally good nor strategically sound. It is a better thing that we still have good combined cycle gas stations with decent capacity as we rely crucially on them. It is a pity we rely more and more on imported gas, when maybe we should prospect for more in our own territory to cut down transport costs and reduce the strain on our balance of payments. It would also be the greener option. It is a pity the industry has got rid of the Rough Field which was an important gas store. We now operate with very levels of stocks, so our security of supply is poor.</p>
<p>The truth is we do not have enough domestic energy for our needs and are becoming far too dependent on imports. If we want an electric revolution the first task must be to put in a large increase in electrical capacity so the power will be there as and when the electric cars and heating systems take off as consumer items. If we want to be sure we can keep the lights on and the boilers keeping us warm it would also be a good idea to put in some additional generating capacity anyway, and to look at increasing domestic output of gas. It would also help to put in more gas storage against more cold winter days when the wind does not blow. The government needs to review all this, as the energy market is now complex mixture of subsidies, arranged prices and managed contracts where the regulator and government have a major role.</p>
<p>The first duty of government energy policy is to keep the lights on.</p>

Hon. Sir Lindsay Hoyle MP in Speaker’s House at the Palace of Westminster.</p>
<p>This historic cross-party event was to reflect on Anglo-Sikh history and explore issues connected to British Sikhs today. The Speaker welcomed parliamentarians, prestigious guests and leaders of the Sikh community in the State Rooms in the Speaker’s House.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP and Dabinderjit Singh OBE, the principal adviser of the Sikh Federation (UK) reflected on key moments from throughout Anglo-Sikh history over the last 200 years.</p>
<p>Gurpreet Singh Anand, the President of the first Sikh Gurdwara (Central Gurdwara, London) established in 1911 and the current Secretary General of the Sikh Council UK and Balvinder Kaur Saund the Chair of the Sikh Women’s Alliance spoke about issues both connected to and connecting British Sikhs today.</p>
<p>Politicians who spoke at the event also included:</p>
<p>·       Tom Tugendhat MP, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee</p>
<p>·       Kate Green MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Education</p>
<p>·       Joy Morrissey MP, Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)</p>
<p>·       Martin Docherty-Hughes MP</p>
<p>·       Pat McFadden MP</p>
<p>Coinciding with Saragarhi Day as well as the 20th anniversary of 9/11, speakers touched on both the present day and historic contributions and challenges facing the Sikh community. Preet Kaur Gill MP reflected on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, for whom British Sikhs have been the target of hate crime and prejudice in the aftermath, as well as the sacrifice of 21 Sikh soldiers in the battle of Saragarhi in 1897. She and Tom Tugendhat MP discussed the Hidden Heroes campaign which they have championed with We Too Built Britain.</p>
<p>MPs both recognised the enormous contribution of Sikhs to Great Britain, as well as the sacrifice and hardship Sikhs have faced over the decades. MPs took the opportunity to celebrate how over the last 200 years, Britain’s military officials and political leaders have appreciated and promoted the Sikh identity.</p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill MP, the host and Chair of the APPG for British Sikhs said: “It is a great honour to have held this event in Speaker’s House, to gather community leaders and Parliamentarians to celebrate British Sikh heritage and reflect on the issues affecting our communities today.</p>
<p>Sikh history is British history.  To move forward it is important to acknowledge and understand the historic injustices and challenges Sikhs have faced while building on the great successes in Anglo-Sikh history over the past 200 years. That starts with open engagement and an honest reckoning with our country’s past.</p>
<p>Across the globe, Governments should appreciate the enormous contribution Sikhs make to the world, working in collaboration with them to realise their ethos for the betterment of all.”</p>

<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has questioned a government proposal to change test requirements for new HGV drivers.  This, along with plans to extend working hours for transportation workers, could have damaging consequences for safety on the roads.</p>
<p>Smyth wrote to Baroness Vere, Parliamentary Under Secretary for the Department for Transport in early September, expressing her concerns at the plans to change safety requirements for HGV drivers.  Of particular concern was a proposal to allow car drivers who have qualified since 1997 to tow a trailer over 3,500kg.  </p>
<p>Smyth has long campaigned on trailer safety after a constituent was killed by a runaway trailer in Bedminster.  The Government previously recognised the importance of her campaign, but the new proposals raise risks for all of the positive achievements of the campaign. </p>
<p>The Labour Party is calling on the Government to address driver shortages in the HGV sector through appointing a Minister for the supply chain crisis, working with businesses and unions to improve terms and conditions of contracts, and making it easier for drivers from abroad to fill short-term vacancies rather than piling more pressure on exhausted drivers and risking road safety.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth is concerned that these proposals will put at risk the work of the trailer safety campaign and during a recent Urgent Question urged the Secretary of State for Transport to arrange a briefing between his department and Ms Smyth.</p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: </p>
<p>“I was deeply concerned to hear about the Government’s proposals to address HGV driver shortages.  Long-term problems in the HGV sector will not be solved by making drivers work longer hours and changing test requirements for new drivers, and it threatens to put so many people at risk on the roads.</p>
<p>“Since 2014 I have been campaigning for safer towing, but I now fear that these new proposals will put at risk all the positive progress that has been made in highlighting trailer safety.</p>
<p>“During an Urgent Question in Parliament, I urged the Secretary of State to arrange a meeting between myself, his officials and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Trailer Safety. We cannot slide backwards on the progress we have made as it will put people’s lives at risk.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/09/14/karin-smyth-mp-questions-government-decision-to-change-test-requirements-for-new-hgv-drivers/">Karin Smyth MP questions Government decision to change test requirements for new HGV drivers</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p><span><span><span>Latest figures from the independent Office for National Statistics show the claimant count in South Shropshire fell by 70 between July and August, to 1,725 people. This is a claimant rate of 3.6% of the population aged 16-64, compared to 5.2% across the UK. Unemployment of those aged 18-24 in South Shropshire also fell between July and August. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Nationally, unemployment continues to fall, with the number of payrolled employees across the UK now having returned to pre-pandemic levels, following nine consecutive months of growth. Reflecting the economic recovery, the number of job vacancies in June to August 2021 surpassed 1 million, for the first time since records began.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: </span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>“This latest fall in unemployment in South Shropshire is an encouraging sign for the economy, and reflects the improving trading conditions as coronavirus restrictions were lifted in July. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“I am hopeful that the winter plan outlined by the government will ensure we can continue to recover the economy and deliver the security of regular work for more people in South Shropshire, while keeping the virus in check.”</span></span></span></p>

<p>With news breaking that HIAL and Prospect are seemingly reaching a position of agreement, although quite what the detail is, the mood music seems positive from all sides.</p>



<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar MP Angus B MacNeil commented:</p>



<p>“For the first time in a very long time, it is good to see some positive news emerging over the issue of the ATMS project and the retention of island jobs. We can only hope that this ultimately means the Government gets to save £2 million each and every year and that jobs remain within Scotland’s island groups; vital, important and well paid jobs.</p>



<p>“It is great to see HIAL and Prospect coming together to work for the good of the area and try to find a common position. This is definitely a move in the right direction and people are now cautiously optimistic that the right outcome will happen, namely the retention of these jobs in our islands.”</p>

<p>On the morning of Saturday 4th September, as a Labour and Co-operative MP, I was pleased to deliver the Parliamentary Co-operative Group report to the Wales Co-operative Council Zoom meeting. My report highlighted that, even though Parliament has been on summer recess for the month of August, we have continued to work on increasing protection for retail workers because of the escalating levels of violence, threats, and abuse that they suffer at work; opposing cuts to the aid budget, and the International Aid cuts for the effect it would have on the co-operative sector that does so much to alleviate poverty in developing countries. We opposed privatisation of Channel 4; called for the UK Tory Government to maintain the £20 Universal Credit uplift, and many other causes. I welcomed my old friend Huw Lewis, who has been appointed as the Co-operative Party’s Policy and Membership Officer Wales, to his first Wales Co-operative Council meeting. As former MS for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and former Welsh Government Minister, Huw will be a tremendous asset to the Co-operative Party in Wales. The Wales Council members discussed, amongst other things, our plans for the UK Co-operative Party Conference which will be held online again in October, because of Covid-19 restrictions. It was a very long meeting, but there is always so much to discuss, because the Wales Co-operative Party is always very active throughout every region of the country.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon I joined the Welsh Labour Women’s Committee Zoom meeting together with our Neath CLP Women’s Officer Cathy James. There were 25 female representatives from all over Wales on the call who provided updates from their regions. I welcomed back my old friend Michelle Perfect who has returned to be secretary of the committee after an absence of a few years. We all agreed it’s great to have Michelle looking after us again. Baroness Anita Gale, former General Secretary of Welsh Labour, gave an update on the Women’s Charter, and Baroness Debbie Wilcox updated us on the work she has done in succeeding Anita as Shadow Equalities Minister on the Lords Front Bench. It was a pleasure to have Shadow Secretary of State for Wales Nia Griffith speaking about the work she does to continue to represent women’s issues in Wales. And to have Nia, Anita and Debbie support my call to encourage more women to become involved in local government in Wales ahead of the Local Government Elections in May 2022.</p>
<p>This week, the Government have introduced a National Insurance Contributions Bill. The Bill comprises four areas, three of which refer to the provision of NIC relief for employers who meet certain conditions. There would be NIC relief for 36 months under a certain threshold for freeport employers. There would also be relief for employers of veterans of the Armed Forces for a period of 12 months, however the relief would have to be claimed back at a later date. Labour are concerned that this could discourage some employers from making use of the relief. 60% of veterans in the UK are aged 65 and over, that means as many as 960,000 veterans are of working age, with skills and experience that could be invaluable in civilian life. Supporting employers to make use of these skills and to help veterans remain in work and engaged in civilian life is vital. The UK Government must do more.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning I attended the AGM of the APPG on Gaps in Support, where we re-elected our Co-Chairs and there was unanimous agreement that we should continue to fight for those who have fallen through the gaps in UK Government support during the pandemic and its associated lockdown and restrictions.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon, as a member of the Panel of Parliamentary Chairs, I chaired the Second Delegated Legislative Committee on the Draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Administration, Investment, Charges and Governance) (Amendment) Regulations 2021. This instrument amends existing secondary legislation relating to the administration and governance requirements on trustees of occupational defined contributions (DC) pension schemes, in particular to require trustees of certain DC pension schemes to disclose their investment returns and demonstrate they are providing value for their members. It also increases flexibility for DC schemes to take account of performance fees payable to fund managers when calculating the cap on charges that applies to default management arrangements. And it changes the way in which types of pension schemes must comply with the requirements to produce a statement of investment principles. The instrument was debated, not opposed by the opposition parties, and passed without the need to push to a vote.</p>
<p>I stand with Labour against the UK Government’s plans to diminish our democracy through their Voter ID plans. Photo ID is not free and millions, including the elderly, low income, and ethnic minority voters, cannot afford the privilege of photo ID. Three and a half million people – that’s 7.5% of our electorate – do not have access to any form of photo ID. Voter ID is a complete waste of taxpayers’ money at a time when there are far greater priorities – the NHS, children in poverty, low-income workers. The cost of the Conservatives’ unnecessary plan to force voters to carry photo ID will be 20 times more than it is spending on fraud – the most prevalent type of crime and something that fills my constituency email far more than concerns over voter fraud. There were just 139 allegations of voter fraud in 2020, which led to just one conviction and one caution for impersonation. In the same year, there were 4.5 million offences of fraud, according to official figures. This UK Government is not interested in tackling the crime that affects our communities; it is instead focusing on disenfranchising those less likely to vote Tory.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I was pleased to be able to <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/96e07025-e014-47c0-ac46-96f5e9442132">lead a debate</a> on co-operative purchases of companies by employee groups at risk of redundancy. The effects of the pandemic have been devastating for so many people, and we need to discuss some co-operative ways of supporting the economic recovery in a way that builds a UK economy that is more inclusive and more equal than before. The symptoms of inequality that have plagued our country for too long were there for all to see a long time before the first pandemic lockdown was implemented in March 2020. In one of the world’s richest nations, too many families have been struggling to put food on the table, and the pandemic has highlighted this. I commend all the wonderful people who have worked, and who continue to work, relentlessly and tirelessly during all the severe challenges of the pandemic, in order to make sure that our communities function. However, those wonderful workers take home some of the lowest wages. This must change.</p>
<p>We can learn much from Italy and the so-called Marcora law, named after the former Italian industry Minister Giovanni Marcora, who established the worker buy-out system more than 30 years ago, to divert the money spent on unemployment to retain jobs and continue economic activity. The Marcora law gives workers the right and, most importantly, the financial support to buy out all or parts of an at-risk business and establish it as an employee-owned co-operative. Workers are given the opportunity to rescue profitable parts of businesses or the whole of profitable businesses. The legislation in Italy does that by giving those workers at risk of redundancy their unemployment benefits as a lump sum in advance to use as capital for the buy-out, as well as access to the necessary support and advice to make it successful. The results speak for themselves. Hundreds of businesses previously at risk of closure have been preserved as worker co-operatives, with an economic return of more than six times the capital invested by the funding mechanisms. In Italy, between 2007 and 2013, €84 million was made available for worker buy-outs, generating €473 million and saving more than 13,000 jobs. We need to give serious consideration to implementing a similar type of scheme here in the UK.</p>
<p>Wednesday lunchtime I was in the House of Commons chamber for the first PMQs, following cessation of the hybrid system. The chamber was full to hear from the PM Boris Johnson and the Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer, but whereas the vast majority of opposition MPs wore face masks, all the Government Front Bench and most Tory MPs did not. Opposition MPs are also adhering to Mr Speaker’s advice to wear face masks whilst they are on the Estate, whilst Tory MPs are not. It’s ironic that, by wearing face masks in Westminster, opposition MPs are protecting the health of members of the UK Tory Government.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon I chaired a number of Westminster Hall debates which lasted from 2.30 to 5.30pm. The <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c9e12271-7c72-4e51-8fcc-05623ee41b96">first debate</a> was led by Layla Moran, Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, and was about ending rough sleeping. This very important issue has been debated in Parliament many times before, and it’s very disappointing that even though members across the House agree rough sleeping must end, the UK Tory Government has not prioritised the matter, and merely says that it is absolutely committed to ending it, without making progress. For many years, MPs have been calling on the UK Tory Government to scrap the Vagrancy Act, but so far this has not found a place in its legislative programme.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c9e12271-7c72-4e51-8fcc-05623ee41b96">next debate</a> was about the UK Tory Government’s refusal to provide financial support to the British Council. The debate was led by Wendy Chamberlain, Liberal Democrat MP North East Fife. The British Council is one of the UK’s international organisations for cultural and education opportunities and cultural relationships. It’s an arm’s length body of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and promotes English language education, arts and culture across the globe. The British Council’s own figures show that in 2019-20, it reached 983 million people. The integrated review “Global Britain in a Competitive Age” published earlier this year, stated that Britain would become one of the most influential countries in the world, explicitly highlighting the important work of the British Council in over 100 countries. But during the pandemic, it’s revenues were curtailed and as of July 2021, were only back to 50% of pre-pandemic level. It is predicted that normal levels will not be reached until 2023. The Government provided an assistance grant of £26 million, this was counter balanced by a cut in ODA Grant funding of £80 million. And the 0.7% ODA cut was taken before the review was published. A series of loans have been agreed on commercial terms requiring business plans, but on condition that cost saving measures be carried out. Consequently, closures have taken place from Belgium to US and from Australia to Sudan, including the Five Eyes countries. The British Council has already agreed to a reduction in spending of over £185 million over the next five years, with 20% staffing cuts. Ms Chamberlain asked the Minister Nigel Adams to explain how his UK Tory Government can praise the work of the British Council and all the benefits it brings to the UK, whilst undermining it by withdrawing financial support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c9e12271-7c72-4e51-8fcc-05623ee41b96">last debate</a> was led by Elliot Colburn Conservative MP Carsholton and Wellington, about reducing plastic waste, which continues to grow in the UK, and an estimated 5 million tonnes are used every year, nearly half in packaging. It harms our environment if not recycled and lasts centuries in landfill or if discarded as litter, pollutes our oceans, rivers, soils and the creatures within. If the use of plastic continues, emissions of greenhouse gases by the global plastic sector will account for 15% of the entire annual carbon global budget by 2050. The Chamber Engagement Team conducted a survey which asked for suggestions for recycling, replacement, and reduction of plastic, and produced over 500 public responses. The UK Government Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Rebecca Pow MP, stated that the UK Government has set a target of reducing landfill waste by 10% by 2035, zero avoidable plastic waste by 2042, tough bans on micro beads and micro plastics, 10p plastic bag charge, restricting the use of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds and will go further after consultation on banning single use plastic plates, cutlery, and polystyrene drink containers. And concluded by saying that the U.K. Government is moving at great speed in the right direction.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night I voted for the Official Opposition amendment to the UK Government’s Heath and Social Care Levy, which we lost by 335-243 votes, and against the main motion, which the UK Government won by 319-248. Some Tories who spoke against the Levy voted with us, but as usual, many caved in and supported the Government’s motion.</p>
<p>Friday morning the regional MSs and MPs received a confidential briefing from SBUHB about the pandemic, its effect on health and social care services, and the progress of the <a href="https://sbuhb.nhs.wales/news/news-categories/coronavirus-covid-19-innovations/">vaccination programme</a>.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon I attended the opening of the latest phase of the Neath Abbey Ironworks restoration project by the Friends of Neath Abbey, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Cadw. The Abbey was founded in 1130 and by the late 13th century was one of Wales’ wealthiest monasteries. It is unique in that it has been a religious house, reformation mansion and an early industrial revolution copper works, which existed many years before Swansea’s. Nearly all of the entire layout of the Abbey can be seen today. Neath Abbey Ironworks changed our lives forever and has three scheduled monuments, with two of the best and biggest surviving 18th century blast furnaces. It pioneered construction, steam engines, locomotives, town gas plants, marine engines, iron steam and sailing ships. It helped to make Wales the first industrial nation by drawing people away from working on the land, and its plans are registered on the UNESCO Memory of the World programme. At the Ironworks the Friends have erected accessible interpretive panels to explain the history and function of its structures and buildings with QR codes, and two notice boards for community engagement, specifically involving children. Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive school staff and 658 pupils studied the heritage and the children produced 105 pictures, which are on display. The Friends selected three pupils to receive awards in recognition of their artwork, and I was honoured to present one of the awards. Jeremy Miles MS for Neath and I unveiled a plaque in memory of my dear friend Debbie Harvey who was responsible for rejuvenating the Friends of Neath Abbey, and driving the restoration. Debbie was a lovely person who never had a bad word to say about anyone, and I miss her more every day.</p>
<p>I voted with Labour last week against the UK Government’s planned cut to Universal Credit. It is shameful that the very workers who got us through this crisis are in the firing line for a £1000 cut to their income every year. This £20 is what enables some families to put food on the table at the end of the week and there is near-universal opposition to these plans. Labour, the public, MPs from across the House of Commons, dozens of charities and campaign groups and now, the six Tory predecessors of the Work and Pensions Secretary of State all agree that this money must remain in place. Newspapers have continually reported throughout the pandemic how the wealth of the richest people has increased during the pandemic and yet this UK Government is cruelly and lazily choosing the easy option to cut funding from the poorest, many of whom are key workers who have ensured the running of shops, public transport, and hospitals throughout this crisis. It is utterly unconscionable.</p>

<p>When is a promise not a promise? When it comes from Boris Johnson! Two of his promises have just collided. On 13th December 2019, he stood outside Downing St and promised to fix social care once and for all. He said his priority would be to crack on with it in his first 100 days. He also promised not to raise Income Tax, VAT or National Insurance. Now we know he’ll break his word on National Insurance.</p>



<p>No one doubts the need to improve social care especially following big reductions in funding between 2010 and 2019. People shouldn’t have to wait ages for assessments or be forced to settle for inadequate care. It’s that lack of support that leads to falls and other difficulties resulting in hospitalisation. There’s also the issue of care homes for those no longer able to live by themselves. We saw during the pandemic just how much we expect of care workers and how poor their wages are.</p>



<p>We need a plan for social care to make it fit for the 21st century. Half-baked attempts at a quick fix just won’t do but despite the promises, there isn’t any real plan other than squeezing more money out of young people and those on low incomes. They’re being asked to foot the bill for those who live in large houses. Many think increasing National Insurance is a mistake and argue, when it comes to funding, we’ve got to consider different options including Capital Gains Tax (CGT). The best idea I’ve seen is from the Association of Accounting Technicians who suggest reducing CGT on houses to make it easier for people to sell properties but increasing it on items like the sale of shares, art and coin collections and other high value assets. That would increase the money available for social care.</p>



<p>What’s clear is that we need a real plan to improve the provision and overall quality of social care, the plan Boris Johnson promised, and we need it to be properly and fairly funded. It’s time this Prime Minister started making good on his promises.</p>

Yesterday, the Prime Minister set out the Government’s long-awaited plan to confront and deal with the social care crisis that we are faced with. This isn’t a new issue; Governments of all colours have been talking about social care reform for over 20 years. Therefore, the fact that the Government…

              <h3>Judith Cummins (Bradford South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p><strong>In her <a href="https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/19565264.bradford-south-mp-judith-cummins-lots-words---little-credible-action-government/">latest editorial in the Telegraph &amp; Argus</a>, Judith talks about her recent work on a range of important local and national issues:</strong></p>



<p>I hope that people have managed to get a break during the summer. Over the summer months we saw terrible events unfold in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is an international crisis which the government needs to lead the national response to. The withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan has left many people in fear of their lives from Taliban reprisals. The government has a moral responsibility to play its part in defending those Afghans who are in the greatest danger from the Taliban.</p>



<p>This situation requires a national response; it should not be left up to local authorities across the country to volunteer to support those escaping from the new Afghan regime. The Government must lead a coordinated and well-resourced plan that disperses those seeking refuge from Taliban across the United Kingdom in a fair way. I expect Bradford to play its full part in this. But I also expect every other council to do the same, and for the government to fully fund any resettlement program.</p>



<p>The Government have given us lots of words at present but very little credible action as to how they are going to do this and also how they plan to bring British nationals that are still stranded in Afghanistan home. This must be their immediate priority.</p>



<p>The Government should have acted to improve Social Care over a decade ago. The delaying of taking decisive action has left social care in a crisis with services grossly underfunded and understaffed – something that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated. However, rather than leading a national debate on what care services should look like in the future, the government is rushing through a manifesto-breaking raise to National Insurance. This is not a plan to tackle the crisis in social care, it is just an unfair tax rise.</p>



<p>We are all in agreement that Social Care needs extra funding, but there are fairer ways that this money can be raised. The government should be considering introducing new income tax brackets that ensure that those with the broadest shoulders pay their fair share of the social care bill, instead the current government proposals will mean that lower paid people across my Bradford South constituency will instead be worse off. Fundamentally, we need a fair and equal plan to fund our Social Care services not one that will seemingly mean that the rich stay rich, but the poor become poorer.</p>



<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and increased many of the inequalities and challenges faced by employees such as low-pay, insecure work, and insufficient working hours. As we move forward, we now need to look at addressing these issues as it’s simply not good enough to go back to the pre-Covid ‘normal’ of a deregulated labour market, we need to create a new way of working that is fairer for all.</p>



<p>The government commissioned a report into this issue in 2017, but as is typical of the current Government – it has still has not implemented any of the report.</p>



<p>People in Bradford South, and right across the country, need strong legislation to bolster employment protections in the post-Covid world.  I will be strongly advocating for this as we continue to emerge from the pandemic.</p>



<p>As big national and international issues dominate the headlines, here at home in Bradford there are many local nuisances that gravely impact on people’s lives.</p>



<p>As we approach bonfire night the issue of fireworks disturbances after dark will become an even greater annoyance. Although unfortunately this is an issue that sadly plagues many people all year round.</p>



<p>Using a firework after 11pm is an offence under the Fireworks Act 2003. There are various ways in which police can deal with this and I will be ensuring that the council and the police must make full use of the current powers that they have at their disposal.</p>



<p>However, it is clear to me that the legislation around fireworks needs to be improved and that is why I am planning to call for a debate in Parliament to challenge the government to do more to help my constituents live in a less noisy and safer environment.</p>



<p>Before the summer recess, I challenged the Government in parliament to tackle the issues surrounding&nbsp;quad&nbsp;bike use, with a view to exploring the banning of&nbsp;quad&nbsp;bikes for on–road use. I speak with many local residents who have concerns that quad&nbsp;bikes driving up and down our roads, and sometimes pavements, in an anti-social manner often with face coverings and no licence plates.</p>



<p>As the Government have no current plans to introduce legislation on this serious issue. I will continue to work to ensure this issue gets the attention from Government it deserves. Local people shouldn’t have to put up with this.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Millions of people across the UK, including many in Llanelli,
may be excluded from their democratic right to vote under plans put forward
today by the Conservative UK Government, according to local MP, Nia Griffith.</p>



<p>In the recent Queen’s Speech, the Government formally
announced their plans to introduce mandatory Voter ID at the next election.
This policy requires voters to present photo ID to vote at polling stations in
future general elections. </p>



<p>NIA GRIFFITH, MP for Llanelli, said: </p>



<p>“Voting is safe and secure in Britain. Ministers should
be promoting confidence in our elections instead of spreading baseless scare
stories. </p>



<p>Millions of people lack photo ID in this country
including many here in Llanelli &#8211; in particular the elderly, low income and
Black, Asian and ethnic minority voters. 7.5% of the electorate – don’t have
access to any photo ID at all, so will be excluded from voting if the Tories go
through with this. </p>



<p>Driving licenses and passports cost money &#8211; something
that many people don’t have. In addition, young voters are far less likely to
carry a form of photo ID, threatening to silence their voices in our democracy.”</p>



<p>The MP, who will be voting against the proposals later
today in the House of Commons, added:</p>



<p>“It doesn&#8217;t matter how the government dresses it up,
these plans make it harder for working class, young and ethnic minority people
to vote. It’s simply undemocratic and wrong and that the Government are
attempting to supress voters. </p>



<p>Voter fraud is a vanishingly rare offence in the UK. In
2019, out of 59 million votes cast in elections, there was just one conviction
for voter impersonation – the type of fraud that Voter ID is support to tackle.
You are more likely to get struck by lightning twice than commit voter fraud. </p>



<p>These plans are also shockingly expensive, forecast to
cost at least £17 million per general election – money that can be spent far
better elsewhere.” </p>

<p>A cross-party group of Members of Parliament have written to the Home Secretary asking for urgent action to protect Afghan nationals. The full letter and signatories below:</p>
<p><strong>SENT VIA EMAIL </strong>to Rt Hon Priti Patel MP, Secretary of State for the Home Department</p>
<p>19 August 2021</p>
<p><strong>Re: Securing adequate protection for Afghan nationals</strong></p>
<p>Dear Home Secretary,</p>
<p>The whole country has watched in horror the fall of Afghanistan to Taliban forces. The eyes of the world will now be watching how countries with a proud history of welcoming refugees respond, and particularly how they treat people forced to flee. Reports confirm that extrajudicial killings have already begun. Those in particular danger include women and girls, ethnic minorities, LGBTIQ+ people and journalists. In addition, anyone seen to be supportive of the Afghan government or of international organisations is at risk of being targeted.</p>
<p>People currently at risk from the Taliban need to flee immediately and by whatever means necessary. For many, this will be via irregular journeys. A large-scale international resettlement effort is desperately needed to evacuate people from the country and the surrounding region. However, the deadly scramble for safety at Kabul Airport in recent days demonstrates why a resettlement-only approach to refugee protection, as proposed in the Nationality and Borders Bill currently before Parliament, cannot work.</p>
<p>As a matter of urgency, the Government must establish sustainable solutions for those who will seek our protection over the coming weeks and months, as well as Afghans already living in the UK, their families and loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>To achieve this, the Government must urgently take the following steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure no Afghan national faces removal to any third country under the inadmissibility rules, regardless of how they have travelled to seek protection in the UK. These individuals should instead be offered immediate and sustainable protection</li>
<li>Introduce a simplified process to grant immediate protection to some 3000 Afghan nationals currently awaiting a decision on their asylum application and facilitate an expedited application process for those submitting a fresh or new claim going forwards.</li>
<li>Ensure no Afghan national is evicted from asylum accommodation while this procedure is being established.</li>
<li>Expedite family reunification applications for people from Afghanistan and widen the criteria to include parents and siblings of applicants. Normal procedures requiring applications to take place through embassies must similarly be suspended.</li>
<li>Immediately release all Afghan nationals currently held in immigration removal centres, given the impossibility of safely effecting removals.</li>
<li>Review and broaden Afghan Locally Employed Staff Relocation schemes to protect people working in all at-risk professions, for instance drivers and security staff who have worked with the UK.</li>
<li>Immediately publish new policy guidance reflecting the need for humanitarian protection, and the danger faced by numerous social groups including women and girls, LGBTIQ+ people, men and boys targeted by the Taliban, ethnic and religious minorities, and human rights defenders throughout the country, including Kabul.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as presenting an urgent protection challenge, this situation also calls into question the Government’s current approach to refugee protection in general. When people are forced to flee in the middle of the night, there is no queue they can join for resettlement. People whose lives are at risk will be forced to flee by whatever means are available to them, including irregular means.</p>
<p>In light of this crisis, we urge the Government to drop its current inadmissibility rules, and its decision to criminalise refugee journeys that are not undertaken through regulated resettlement routes. Refugees reaching our shores must have their claims assessed based solely on need and never on their method of flight. The provisions in the Nationality and Borders Bill currently before Parliament that would criminalise refugees based on their mode of travel, and introduce a two-tier system of refugee protection, must be withdrawn.</p>
<p>It is within the Government’s gift to mount a world-leading, compassionate response to this crisis. We hereby call on the Government and the Ministers responsible to act urgently to deliver the compassionate response that is so sorely needed.</p>

			<p>Many constituents have contacted me about the appalling and deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, after the Taliban took control of the capital city of Kabul on Sunday, August 15.</p>
<p>I share your profound concern and distress about the impact this will have on the lives of Afghan people, particularly women and those who have been working alongside NATO forces, NGOs and many others.</p>
<p>I was in the Chamber today to speak not only as the vice-Chair of the Afghanistan APPG, but also on behalf of my co-worker and dear friend Marzia Babakarkhail. Like so many others, Marzia had to flee her home in Afghanistan after the Taliban tried to assassinate her. You can watch my speech in full <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/392a628b-beda-4bc1-91df-584f2a1cdf90?in=13:37:34">here.</a></p>
<p>The present situation on-ground in Afghanistan is shocking and worsening by the hour. The withdrawal of international forces in the country, especially those of the U.S, has lead to the inevitable fall of the Afghani Government, just two weeks before the U.S. was due to complete its troop withdrawal. I remain extremely concerned about the speed with which the insurgents stormed across the country, capturing all major cities in a matter of days.</p>
<p>We now face the tragic rollback of the gains that UK soldiers, diplomats and NGO workers, and their coalition and Afghan partners made over the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Women and girls will lose the freedoms they gained and those speaking out face real threats to their lives alongside members of the LGBT+ community and religious minorities who were viciously targeted under Taliban rule and now face extermination. This is in part due to the catastrophic miscalculation of the capacity and legitimacy of the Afghan government, and the resilience of Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the U.S. and its allies. That the international community has been caught out in this way is quite shocking and speaks volumes about our priorities and the lack of a human rights focus in our foreign policies.</p>
<p>The international community&#8217;s response including the UK’s has been absolutely woeful and far too slow considering the immense danger so many are in as the situation is so fast-changing. This is a shameful dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>The immediate focus must be for the government to accelerate efforts to get UK nationals, support staff and the thousands of Afghans nationals who have served and worked alongside coalition forces out of the country. As well as the women activists who are now in grave danger of Taliban reprisals, many of whom have already faced threats. We have already seen reports of Taliban hit squads hunt down those they see as “collaborating” with coalition forces.</p>
<p>We should help lead that effort by committing to a British Afghanistan Resettlement Programme, to create safe and legal routes so those suffering at the hands of the Taliban can make a new life here in Britain. The Government’s proposal to take just an initial 5,000 refugees followed by only 20,000 over 5 years is not enough. Many of those at the highest risk will not survive waiting for five years to escape the Taliban. This policy must urgently be expanded to ensure people to whom we owe a huge debt are not abandoned because of an arbitrary target. And the promises made by ministers in Parliament must be reflected on the ground.</p>
<p>I support the deployment of troops to Kabul to provide security and capacity to carry out the evacuation. Soldiers and diplomats must be given the resources that they need. But it is increasingly clear there was a failure to plan for a safe and swift evacuation process and ministers have serious questions to answer over the lack of preparedness. Having said that I am also very grateful to Ambassador Bristow who is personally processing applications from Afghan nationals for refuge, and to Lord Tariq Ahmad who has been helping me to get a woman activist under threat and her husband out of Kabul.</p>
<p>Our veterans who served in Afghanistan as well as the families of those who died serving our country must know that their sacrifices were not in vain. The differences they have made to women and girls in particular are immense. What they must be feeling must be overwhelming; we must make sure that they get the resources and support they need.</p>
<p>The Taliban must be judged on what they do, not what they say. There are worrying reports of night raids and arrests of suspects by armed men with a number of local journalists and civil rights workers believed to have been detained. Women face obliteration of their rights, despite the warm words of the Taliban that too many have been willing to entertain. There have been reports of women being sent home from work and told to send their male relatives instead. There are reports of girls as young as ten are being sold off to Taliban fighters, mothers are having their eyes gouged out in front of their children, and reprisals against those who helped coalition forces. According to the UNHCR, women and children make up 80% of those fleeing the conflict.</p>
<p>The role of Pakistan in this conflict is absolutely key. During my speech, I called on the Foreign Secretary to restore specific aid funding to Pakistan in response to the influx of Afghan refugees who are crossing into Pakistan, as 350,000 Afghans are on the move inside the country.</p>
<p>The Pakistani Ambassador to the European Union, Zaheer Aslam Janjua recently disclosed that “Pakistan doesn’t have the capacity or the resources to take any more refugees” as Pakistan is already home to more than 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees, according to UN data. However, it is also home to an estimated two million more unregistered Afghan refugees, according to Pakistani government estimates.</p>
<p>Pakistan also has a potential role in moderating the Taliban’s behaviour. I am hopeful that the commitment that Pakistan has expressed to me over human rights in Kashmir will extend across the region – as you know human rights are universal. Pakistan has made clear that they need help from the international community in keeping the region terrorist-free and managing the 1600mile Durand line, which separates Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is something we could do collectively as this porous border poses a threat not just to Pakistan but to us all especially as there are already concerns that the Taliban might begin to question the legitimacy of the border now that it is in power.</p>
<p>The steps that Pakistan now takes will be vitally important as the Taliban’s takeover will affect the country more deeply than any other regional power and it is important that the UK government remains in dialogue with the Pakistani Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In the longer term, global Britain must work with its allies to restore not just our reputation but our role in facilitating a law and rules-based system with human rights across the world.</p>
<p>Please be assured, I will do all I can to continue to highlight the plight of the Afghan people.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Last week, I met with the Chief Exec and Operations Manager of Tyne Tunnel 2 to raise concerns following a spike in complaints about the tunnel operators since the introduction of the controversial “pay later” scheme. </p>



<p>I have to agree with many of the complaints, I believe that the payment instructions could be clearer. The ticket states a date and a time however, if you wait until the date shown, it’ll be too late and you’ll incur a £30 fine, I can see how many people are easily misunderstanding what the ticket says.</p>



<p>During the meeting, I asked the Chief Executive, Phill Smith if he could look at other options and suggested changes should be made to the wording on the tickets to make it clearer.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I learnt about plans for the tunnel to remove the barriers completely in a new system called&nbsp;Open Road Tolling.&nbsp; This would mean that there would be no barriers and payments will need to be made either using an online account or the pay later option. Tyne Tunnel 2 say this would increase tunnel capacity, reduce carbon emissions and mean more a more reliable and quicker journey through the tunnel.</p>



<p>However, I again expressed concern that more drivers may receive fines, as the onus would be&nbsp;on drivers to remember to pay the toll as under the new system, they would not receive a ticket which in many cases acts as a reminder. I also asked what facilities have TT2 put in place to support those drivers who do not have access to the internet, in order to pay their toll charge. It was explained that drivers who do not have smart phones or access to the internet could pay their toll at shops who have a PayPoint facility.</p>



<p>I feel many constituents’ pain and frustration. Many people have told me that the current system of pay later is confusing and lacks clarity, I agree and will continue to seek a resolution to this matter.</p>

<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with an update about Coronavirus issues and other local matters.<br />
<strong><br />
International Travel</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, I have been asked by a number of people about the current rules for travel outside the UK and returning here. To find out what the rules are for entering any other country, you should look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Office Travel Advice</a>, which will tell you what the entry requirements are at the moment in each country.</p>
<p>For re-entering the UK, all of the current advice is <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>South Western Railway &amp; Network Rail Timetable Consultation</strong></p>
<p>South Western Railway and Network Rail have launched a consultation about their plans for the post-Pandemic timetable from December 2022 onwards. This consultation is based on an assumption that considerably fewer people will be commuting going forward. The proposals represent a significant downgrading of the pre-pandemic timetable for our line into London Waterloo. They are intending to reduce the number of trains from Ashtead and Epsom in the peak from six trains an hour to four. This would be done by scrapping the services that start at Epsom and making the previous semi-fast service stop at Ewell West and Stoneleigh instead, as well as at all stations further in. At the same time they would make the current reduction in off-peak services permanent.</p>
<p>They will also at the same time introduce the new generation of trains onto our line, which are ten coaches with all of them connected to create an open plan route right through the train. Their argument is that the new trains will have significantly more capacity and will be able to carry as many people as before even with a reduced service. I do not buy that argument. I have met the company to raise my concerns about the plans, and I think it is much too early to judge what passenger numbers will be in nearly eighteen months time. This level of service would have been completely unworkable with pre-pandemic passenger numbers. I would encourage everyone to take part in the consultation and to make your view clear. The details are at <strong><a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/timetables/timetable-consultation-december-2022">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Epsom &amp; Ewell Business Awards 2011-2021</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Epsom and Ewell Business Awards have just been launched for online entries and nominations. This will be the tenth year of the awards, and it’s a great opportunity to nominate your favourite local business, perhaps because of what they have done for you during the pandemic or because they just always look after you really well. Details of how to enter or nominate an entry are <strong><a href="https://www.epsombusinessawards.co.uk/">here</a></strong>. Please do get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering in the Local Community</strong></p>
<p>I know that many people locally put their names forward to volunteer in the community during the pandemic, and either have now finished that work or did not find the right opportunity to do so. If you are someone who is motivated to get involved or frustrated because your help wasn’t needed, I am planning a volunteering event to match potential volunteers with a small group of local charities who need extra help.</p>
<p>The event will be at <strong>St George’s, in Barnett Wood Lane in Ashtead on Friday 10th September</strong> from 4 until 6.30pm.</p>
<p>I will be sending out more details a few days before, but if you are interested please make a note in your diary.</p>
<p>I hope that you manage to enjoy something of a break this summer and that the weather improves.</p>
<p>Best wishes<br />
Chris</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to my July&nbsp;email newsletter. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well during this challenging time, as we start to try to return to normality from the pandemic and enjoy the Summer, whilst still trying to be cautious and sensible with precautions where possible&nbsp;in the face of rising cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is only right that at this critical juncture in our journey out of lockdown, we take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices of the wonderful people who make up our NHS, our key workers, and all those involved in the vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below you&#8217;ll find updates on the latest cases and vaccination restrictions, a link to my new online survey and details of what&#8217;s been happening in Parliament and around Amber Valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Online Summer Survey – let me know your views:</u></strong></p>



<p>As we head towards Summer Recess in Parliament, I’m about to start delivering my annual report across Amber Valley – please say hello if you see me out and about.</p>



<p>In the report and online, I’m launching a survey to get your views on local issues and recovering from Covid-19, from health appointments to boosting our economy.</p>



<p>Please take just a couple of minutes to complete my Summer Survey and let me know your views <a href="https://www.nigelmillsmp.com/nigels-summer-survey/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing Lockdown Restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>On Monday 19<sup>th </sup>July 2021, the Government lifted all remaining restrictions on social distancing in England. This represents a further step towards normality as we adjust to living with this virus. Although coronavirus cases are continuing to rise nationally, we have not seen the corresponding rise in hospitalisations and deaths that we would expect given the rates of illness we observed last year. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly clear that the link between infections and serious illness is sufficiently broken to enable this further relaxation of restrictions. However, we must remain careful and exercise our own good judgement to keep transmission in our local community to a minimum.</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Case Rates</u></strong></p>



<p>The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant continues to spread across the country and Public Health England (PHE) is now confident that it has overtaken the Alpha variant to become the most dominant strain of the virus circulating in the UK. The Delta variant is believed to be around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which itself is more transmissible than the original strain of coronavirus. Encouragingly however, new analysis by PHE shows that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.</p>



<p>As predicted in light of this, cases continue to rise nationally, and this trend is no different locally in Amber Valley. You can find the latest case data <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read?postcode=DE7%206DG">here</a>. We are now ahead of the England average which highlights the need for us to remain careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Local Vaccines</u></strong></p>



<p>The Country’s vaccine program continues apace with more than 46.2 million people in the UK having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine &#8211; part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.</p>



<p>I was pleased to see the rollout expanded after the Government hit its target of offering a first jab to everyone in the top priority groups &#8211; all those over the age of 50, plus those in high-risk categories by mid-April. With every adult in the UK now having been offered their first dose of the vaccine. A terrific effort, nationally and locally.</p>



<p>As of last Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> July, Amber Valley had successfully given at least one dose of the vaccine to 88% of local adults, with 72.8% having received both jabs. This remains slightly above the average for England which stands at 87.7% of adults having received one jab, and 68% both jabs. These figures are a testament to the exemplary vaccine program here in our constituency.</p>



<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team, and the local NHS to ensure that this area continues to see the full roll out of vaccines.</p>



<p><strong><u>Easing of restrictions</u></strong></p>



<p>As of Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July, all legal restrictions on social distancing in England have been lifted. This is truly excellent news, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing Amber Valley businesses, organisations, and individuals operating at full capacity without legal restrictions.</p>



<p>The following measures are now in place across England:</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on how many people can meet.</p>



<p>&#8211; 1m-plus rule removed (except in some places like hospitals).</p>



<p>&#8211; Face coverings no longer required by law.</p>



<p>&#8211; Nightclubs can open.</p>



<p>&#8211; Pubs and restaurants no longer table service only.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on guests at weddings and funerals.</p>



<p>&#8211; No limits on people attending concerts, theatres or sports events.</p>



<p>&#8211; No restrictions on communal worship.</p>



<p>It is important to remember, however, that this easing of restrictions is designed to empower ourselves as individuals to use our common sense to slow the spread of the virus, which is still very present in our communities. Therefore, I implore you to enjoy these new freedoms responsibly.</p>



<p>As ever, to find out more information on what restrictions apply in your area please look <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Supporting our local economy</u></strong></p>



<p>As we try to re-open, it&#8217;s key to support our local economy to bounce back, and provide a boost to local jobs and businesses. Unemployment is Amber Valley is currently at 4.2%, which is below the national average of 5.6% and 150 lower than in May 2021. As the Job Retention Scheme (furlough) starts to wind down, we need to remain cautious, but there are lots of vacancies around and local employers advertising job opportunities, including the Kickstart Scheme to help young people get back into work. I&#8217;ll also look to organise a Job Fair, maybe initially virtually, over the next few months &#8211; please get in touch if you&#8217;d like to be involved in this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Borders Bill</u></strong></p>



<p>I’ve recently welcomed the Government’s New Plan for Immigration, also known as the Borders Bill, into parliament. This legislation intends to:</p>



<ul><li>Speed up the removal of failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals.</li><li>Introduce maximum life sentences for people smugglers.</li><li>Empower the Border Force to do more to stop and seize small boats and search containers for hidden migrants.</li><li>Stop illegal arrivals gaining immediate entry into the asylum system if they have travelled through a safe county (like France).</li><li>Increase the maximum sentence for illegally entering the UK.</li><li>Grant resettled refugees indefinite leave to remain.</li><li>Better integrate refugees who are resettled.</li></ul>



<p>I know constituents want more to be done to reduce illegal immigration. I will, therefore, continue to engage with ministers throughout this Bill’s journey through parliament to ensure the Government delivers on its manifesto commitments of reducing illegal immigration to UK.</p>



<p><strong><u>In Parliament:</u></strong></p>



<p>In Parliament this month, I&#8217;ve been asking questions on travel restrictions, catch-up education and English Votes for English Laws legislation.</p>



<p>During recent questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, I raised the issue on behalf of constituents of families with children under 18 wanting to travel abroad, but who aren&#8217;t eligible for the vaccine as yet. I&#8217;m pleased the Secretary of State agreed to look into this issue, and you can find out more on his answer <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-19b.670.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g680.4">here</a>.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also asked the Secretary of State for Education about catch-up tutoring for school pupils following the pandemic, and you can find the full debate on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-07-06c.768.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g776.0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, during Business Questions in the House, I asked about the continuation of English Votes for English Laws legislation, as part of a continued fair settlement of devolution across the UK. You can find more on this <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-06-24b.1011.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g1023.2">here</a>&nbsp;and on my Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/nigelmills">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Solar Farm</u></strong></p>



<p>Locally, I’ve been working with local residents and councillors to help oppose plans to construct a 310-acre solar farm on a vast swathe of green space between Alfreton and Oakerthorpe. The solar farm has been proposed by Kronos Solar and is subject to several planning applications across Amber Valley Borough Council and North East Derbyshire District Council. I think this would destroy our local landscape due it&#8217;s scale and extent, so whilst I&#8217;m not against renewable energy or solar panels, I think these applications are inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The applications are still awaiting determination by the councils (likely to be in September) so there&#8217;s still time to comment or lodge any concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find details of the residents&#8217; objection group, and information on the individual applications and how to comment if you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savealfretoncountryside/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>Amber Valley Borough Council Local Plan consultation &#8211; Have your say!</u></strong></p>



<p>The new administration at the Borough Council has launched a new consultation on the next stage of preparing Amber Valley&#8217;s Local Plan, a development document which will set out and plan future housing growth in the area, and making sure we have the infrastructure improvements to match any new homes. I welcome the planned reduction in the overall number of new homes being proposed, which is part of the consultation. The Council are also consulting on the options for the overall strategy (spatial strategy) of the plan, which include focusing housing growth on the Derby City urban area border, in and around Amber Valley&#8217;s four key towns, or in the wider area and villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation on the proposals and headline strategy for the plan so far is open from now until the 30th September 2021. Please do take opportunity to feed in your views to the Council &#8211; I know how strongly residents rightly feel over housing in our area, and so this is the most important chance to have your say on making sure we protect our Green Belt and shaping&nbsp;the future of planning in our area. You can find the consultation and how to submit your views on the proposals <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan/alternative-spatial-strategy-options-for-housing-and-economic-growth/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In response to a question at July Full Council, the Portfolio Holder for Finance and Resources has called on the Government to retain the £20 a week uplift in Universal Credit<strong> – </strong>highlighting how it supports many low paid working people in Nottingham.<br><br>There are roughly 35,000 people on Universal Credit in Nottingham and in response to the pandemic in April last year the Government introduced an increase in payments of £20 a week. There is growing speculation that the Government will reverse the uplift later this year resulting in increasing difficulty for many people who are already struggling.<br><br>Responding to a question at Full Council on the issue, Cllr Sam Webster said “Universal Credit supports low paid working people in our city, tens of thousands of children in our city and people who are entitled to support with housing costs or have lost their job during the Covid pandemic.”</p>



<p>Cllr Webster commenting on the
consequences of the £20 a week uplift being reversed warned that “It will often
be felt most acutely by Nottingham children who are growing up in families
where there already isn’t much money around, families who are living in
poverty.”</p>



<p>In January this year Nottingham City Council passed a motion urging the Government to retain the £20 a week increase to Universal Credit and urging an extension of the payment to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional support. This was followed up by a letter from the Leader of Nottingham City Council to the Chancellor emphasising the importance of the £20 a week uplift. <br> <br> Cllr Webster continued his response by saying “Lower paid and lower skilled working people are much more likely to have lost their job, not be able to work from home, have additional childcare needs, have gone through periods of Covid isolation without receiving pay, have lost hours at work&#8230;.and the list goes on.&nbsp;Reducing Universal Credit now would be big blow to many families who are already struggling to make ends meet.” He also argued that the uplift in Universal Credit should be seen as a litmus test for how seriously the Government is about levelling, saying to not make the uplift permanent would be a case of “levelling down”.<br><br>Cllr Webster ended by saying “In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago it was (and still is) shameful that the poorest people in this country were made to pay the price of mistakes made by the wealthiest. In terms of the policies that our national politicians pursue &#8211; this is one of those markers &#8211; who will The Conservative Government expect to pay for this latest economic and public debt crisis?&nbsp; The message from Labour in Nottingham is crystal clear &#8211; let it not be the poorest families again.”<br><br></p>

<p>Delighted to take part in an excellent cross-party debate on Cervical Screening.  Human Papilloma Virus causes virtually all Cervical Cancer but we can prevent it &#8211; through HPV vaccination &amp; screening to identify women at risk. Although the petition specifically calls for annual cervical smear tests, what we are all actually trying to achieve is the prevention and eventual elimination of cervical cancer.</p>



<p>To reduce the risk of cervical cancer, we need to get rid of the stigma of HPV and ensure that all women and young people understand its importance in the development of cancer. It is a very common virus, which, in the vast majority of cases, causes no harm and is cleared by the body’s own defences, but some strains pose a higher risk of causing malignant change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The HPV vaccine was introduced for young teenage girls in 2008 and initially included those up to 18 years, so that they would be vaccinated before leaving school. The vaccine is now also provided to boys, both to protect them from other HPV-related cancers and to provide additional protection to women by reducing how many men carry HPV in the first place. </p>



<p>The UK National Screening Committee has recommended that women who are HPV-negative and therefore at very low risk are offered routine repeat screening every five years, from the ages of 25 to 65. That system has been fully rolled out in Scotland since March last year.</p>



<p>Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust suggests that a simpler at-home method of sampling could get more women to engage and take up HPV testing as the first step of screening.</p>



<p> <a href="https://www.jostrust.org.uk/">Jo&#8217;s Cervical Cancer Trust | Cervical Cancer Charity (jostrust.org.uk)</a></p>



<p>Please encourage your sons and daughters to take the HPV jag when offered at school, and do attend for your screening appointments. We can all work to prevent Cervical Cancer.  </p>

<p>After holding a constituents surgery in the morning, Mr Shapps went to the Galleria in Hatfield to visit Potential Kids. There, Grant went to see how they had been doing since the launch of their ‘Learn to Ride’ sessions earlier in April.</p>
<p>Potential Kids is a local charity that provides learning, social and sport opportunities to children who are neurodiverse, as well as their families. Their ‘Learn to Ride’ programme provides 1 on 1 bike riding lessons to children.</p>
<p>Speaking about the visit Angela Gaughan, founder of Potential Kids said: &#8220;We were delighted to have the opportunity to talk with the Grant Shapps about the joint project between Hatfields Mens Sheds and Potential Kids.</p>
<p>“Being able to teach children and young people to ride and maintain a bike provides life-long skills that promote independence, mental health and self-esteem, whilst encouraging physical activity and time spent outdoors in the fresh air.</p>
<p>“Grant also had the opportunity to see our Community and Learning Garden project, &#8216;Potential to Grow&#8217;, which has been successfully running over the last 11 months.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for the support we have received in developing this project. Our continued thanks go to Tim Sterling, Center Director at the Galleria for our Hub and Garden and to Welwyn Hatfield Council for their support to build our new kitchen area. Which will enable us to run fun cooking sessions for neurodiverse children, young people, their siblings, and families in the local area, using healthy ingredients grown in our very own garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “Potential Kids look to be doing brilliant work here. I’ve spent a bit of time talking to the leaders here and learning about their work, and the cycling programme more specifically.</p>
<p>“Cycling is great way to get from A to B- it’s healthy for you, and great for the planet. Learning to ride a bike as a child is something that all kids should experience, and it’s great to see that Potential Kids are helping make sure every child has that opportunity.”</p></div>

The meeting came as Mr Shapps recently announced that double vaccinated Brits would no longer have to isolate after travelling to ‘amber list’ countries from 19 July.</p>
<p>Natalie Bennett, a partner at Off Broadway Travel, told Travel Weekly: “He took everything on board, he listened to us, and it went well. He appreciated that travel had been made illegal and said he would talk to the chancellor [about further sector specific support].</p>
<p>Off Broadway Travel tweeted after the visit, saying: “A very productive meeting with @grantshapps today our local MP. Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to listen &amp; understand out sector….”</p>
<p>Mr Shapps said: “I had a very useful discussion with the team at Off Broadway Travel today. They told me about the challenges they’ve faced as a business  over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>“As we unlock domestically, and take some first steps towards flying internationally again, I want to make sure I’m best representing all parts of the transport sector.”</p></div>

<p>There seems to be a webinar for everything — from cooking an apple pie and setting up your email list to creating a company and making your first million. This form of interaction with the target audience became popular for a good reason. It allows to achieve numerous goals:</p>



<ul><li>Selling products</li><li>Attracting new audience</li><li>Improving engagement</li><li>Building and improving brand awareness</li><li>Creating an image of an expert for yourself or your company</li><li>Distributing content</li></ul>



<p>And that’s we’ve just scratched the surface. Every person who creates a webinar has their own unique goals in mind. This wide array of benefits is what makes webinars such a great way to promote your brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="706" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-164" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1088x706.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-325x211.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /></figure>



<p>However, there is one issue with them — they’re popular. Ironic, we know. But this popularity makes it hard for new webinars to actually attract the audience because people are already bored of them. That’s why we need to create a truly outstanding webinar to make it stand out, gain the interest of the audience, and be a success everyone will be talking about for a while. Here is how to do it.</p>



<h2>Start with the topic</h2>



<p>While it seems like an obvious thing — to have a great topic for a webinar — many lecturers miss the whole point of creating one. What might seem like an amazing thing to talk about for you can be hard to understand or useless for your listeners. Topics that don’t get attention from the public are born because the lecturer didn’t think of their audience’s interests hard enough.</p>



<p>So before picking a matter to talk about, determine your target audience. What are its interests, what does it want and need to know? Do your best to put yourself in the shoes of your future listeners and understand what they want to hear during the perfect webinar. This will help you to figure out the best topic your audience will find valuable.</p>



<p>Also, make sure that the topic isn’t too complicated if it’s your first webinar. Start with basics and slowly raise the difficulty of your lectures. This will help you to attract both beginners and advanced specialists gradually thus improving your image and positioning you as a true expert in your field.</p>



<p>Tip: you can test topics in your blog if you have one. Or on some kind of platform such as Medium. It will help you understand if the matter is really interesting to the target audience. Also, you can promote your future webinar in such an article.</p>



<p>Finally, remember about keywords, especially if you plan to keep your webinar uploaded somewhere online for people to watch and rewatch it after the actual stream. By including relevant keywords in the title and the description of your webinar you will increase the chances that users will find your webinar through the search.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="725" src="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165" srcset="https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1088x725.jpg 1088w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-325x217.jpg 325w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.lucianaberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /></figure>



<h2>Figure out the best date and time</h2>



<p>The best day and time for your webinar really depends on your target audience. While some experts say that it’s best to host a lecture on Tuesday through Thursday, and others say that Monday through Friday is fine, too, some listeners might find weekends the best time for a webinar. So before selecting a date, think of your target audience — when they would be able to make time for your lecture? The best solution would be to ask your future listeners when they want to attend your webinar if you have such an opportunity, of course.</p>



<p>Things get especially tricky when your audience is spread around the globe. If you understand that some of your listeners live in a drastically different time zone from other listeners, you should consider holding two streams for these groups.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider is holidays in different countries — you wouldn’t want to have a webinar when a large part of your audience is busy having a vacation or celebrating.</p>



<h2>Invest time in your presentation</h2>



<p>Your slides are just as important as whatever you’re telling your audience. Many lecturers treat presentations as just some visual entertainment for their listeners — why pack slides with information if you already tell it verbally? But that’s a false thought. Think of this — your visual presentation can later become a valuable piece of information both for those who attended your webinar and those who just found slides later. Why would you want to lose an opportunity to keep attracting attention to your work even after your stream? Moreover, an informative presentation you send to your attendees after the webinar is another way to show your audience that you care.</p>



<p>So take your time and put enough work into your presentation — it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure about your design skills, it will be a good idea to get a designer. The slides should both be informative and look appealing.</p>

<h2>Actually, talk about the matter</h2>



<p>We all know these webinars that seem to have the sole purpose of promoting some product of a lecturer. And they’re extremely annoying. People listen to a person bragging about their product for an hour and get little to no information from the lecture. That’s something you don’t want to do if you really want to create a useful and popular webinar.</p>



<p>Build your material with useful information and be generous when sharing your knowledge. The bad example would be to start telling about some matter and then say, “I’ve told about it in my book in chapter four — you can read all the info there.” Don’t be greedy — tell your audience at least half of the information, and then follow it with encouraging listeners to get your book if they want to know even more.</p>



<h2>Answer questions</h2>



<p>Don’t end a webinar once you’re finished with your material. Ask the audience if they have any questions and give as detailed answers as possible. Of course, you should remember about time, too. So it would be a good idea to dedicate, for example, an hour to the lecture itself and then another 30 minutes — to the questions.</p>



<p>Creating and holding a truly outstanding webinar is not an easy task. Yet, if you succeed, you will benefit a lot from your work. Use our tips, and you’ll definitely host a useful and engaging lecture.</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
