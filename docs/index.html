<p>Local&nbsp;health&nbsp;chiefs are about to launch new plans for&nbsp;Weston&nbsp;hospital and, for the first time in what seems like ages, it looks like good news. We’re a growing town and the hospital will expand to match, treating more patients for a wider variety of problems than in the past. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It hasn’t always been this way.&nbsp;Weston&nbsp;Hospital struggled to attract staff for years because it was so much smaller than the big teaching Hospitals in Bristol or Taunton. That meant using expensive agency nurses and locum doctors, which soaked up cash that could have been used to treat more patients, and made services hard to deliver safely too.</p>



<p>We turned a corner when&nbsp;Weston&nbsp;merged with Bristol Royal Infirmary, which made it easier to recruit the missing staff and to share senior medics with the BRI so there’s more experience and knowledge to go round. And it means fewer trips to Bristol for local patients who need things like eye injections or cancer treatments too, because more of them will happen at&nbsp;Weston&nbsp;now instead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The hospital has become less of a political football too, I’m pleased to say. We’ve gone from candle-lit political protests outside the hospital gates a few years ago to cross-party sign-off from the local&nbsp;Health&nbsp;Overview and Scrutiny Panel, which should make things easier for medics all round.</p>



<p>But there are still big issues to solve, and not just in the hospital either. Lots of you are writing to me about problems with GP appointments, NHS dentists, long ambulance waits and more. I’m taking them up with local&nbsp;health&nbsp;chiefs but, in the meantime, there’s a public consultation on the hospital plans that’s starting soon. It’s your chance to have your say, and I’d encourage everyone to get involved. We’ve waited a long time for this, so we’ve got to get it right!</p>

<p>My earliest memory goes right back to 4 June 1977. My third birthday. Right in the middle of the Queen’s Silver Jubilee.</p>
<p>I was on a bus with my Mum and Dad, proudly sporting a third birthday badge. The bus conductor spotted it. He stopped the bus and left it idling next to a bakery on Stockport Road in Ashton, which he ran into. He emerged smiling, and delivered me a cupcake decorated with red, white, and blue icing.</p>
<p>I tell this story, both because it explains my lifelong love of cakes, but also because it says a lot about the importance of the Jubilee. 45 years on, I am still struck by the generous spirit that accompanies these moments of national celebration. It’s a celebration that Manchester has played a huge part in, notably hosting the Commonwealth Games back in 2002 during the Queen’s Golden Jubilee.</p>
<p>On the Platinum Jubilee we commemorate the extraordinary achievement of 70 years on the throne, but also recognise how much has changed in that time.</p>
<p>It’s not just the world that’s changed, so too has Tameside. There wasn’t even a place called ‘Tameside’ in 1952 &#8211; that invention came twenty years later in the 1972 Local Government Act, and was born in 1974, the same year as me. The Charter of Incorporation as a Borough &#8211; a kind of birth certificate &#8211; with the Queen’s now sadly faded signature still holds pride of place in the Mayor’s parlour.</p>
<p>Back in 1952, many of Tameside’s towns were tiny places. Haughton Green was still a village separated from a much smaller Denton by open fields. There were no motorways. Likewise, Audenshaw was much smaller than today, before many of the new housing estates were built. Denton and Dukinfield boomed with industry. Denton, a hatting town; Dukinfield firmly in the cotton trade, with significant manufacturing and engineering works too, shipping goods all over what was still then the Empire.</p>
<p>We live in a different world now, one defined by progress, but also by new challenges.</p>
<p>When the Queen ascended to the throne in 1952, social media giants and cyber technology seemed a million miles away. How we interact has changed, as has the role of Government in a new digital age.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that the Platinum Jubilee comes amid a cost of living crisis, as well as expanding inequalities. Just as the world has changed, so it must change again; becoming fairer and more prosperous.</p>
<p>That’s why I love the Jubilee. It’s an opportunity to celebrate our United Kingdom, to recognise how much we have achieved, and to remind ourselves to continue to work towards a brighter future.</p>

<p><strong>As the campaigner Jack Monroe has highlighted, and as Newcastle’s West End food bank sees in practice, the cruel truth is that the poorer you are, the higher the rate of inflation you face and the fewer choices you have. But the Government have choices, and my constituents are amazed and disgusted at the choices they make to protect windfall profits rather than working people. Why does the Secretary of State think it should be the poorest who pay the price of inflation?</strong></p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I reproduce below my recent Conservative Home article</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I asked the Chancellor following his statement what advice he had received about the possible inflationary consequences of printing lots of money last year, he did not answer. He asserted yet again that the Bank of England is independent.</p>
<p>The Treasury regularly tells us the Bank of England is responsible for controlling inflation. They need to ask themselves why inflation has hit nine per cent, against a two per cent target, and why they think it could even go higher this autumn before falling away.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why Rishi Sunak claims the Bank is independent. The Chancellor chooses the Governor and has influence directly and indirectly over forecasts and policy at the Bank through joint official working and contacts with the Treasury.</p>
<p>Successive governments, with the backing of Parliament, have made substantial changes to the laws, rules and objectives and powers of the Bank over the last thirty years. When George Osborne selected Mark Carney he chose someone who was willing to use the Bank and its forecasts to support the Remain campaign in the referendum, in line with the Chancellor’s thinking.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown changed the inflation target to direct the Bank,and Alastair Darling forced an interest rate cut during the banking crisis on a reluctant Bank to implement an agreed international Finance Ministers’ strategy.</p>
<p>The Treasury respond by saying that what they mean by the Bank is independent is the narrower claim that it has sole control over money policy.</p>
<p>They accept that the Bank has been buffeted by political change. They lost control over managing the state debts and regulating the commercial banks, once thought to be important parts of central banking that were taken away from them.</p>
<p>Even this narrower claim is wrong. Over the last 14 years the main tool of monetary policy has been the creation of billions of pounds of new money by the Bank to buy up state debt. This has kept interest rates very low and would in normal circumstances be inflationary. Every pound of the £895bn created has been formally approved by successive chancellors.</p>
<p>Going further, every pound of bonds the Bank has bought has been underwritten by the Treasury. Chancellors have signed off to indemnify the Bank against all losses on this pile of assets. The Bank has an agreement from the Treasury that will top up its capital to a minimum level whatever happens.</p>
<p>That does not sound very independent and means chancellors need to watch carefully the liabilities the Bank is piling up.</p>
<p>I found it odd the current Chancellor seemed unwilling to talk about this. It has been on his watch that the Bank has bought £450bn of bonds, more than chancellors Darling, Osborne and Philip Hammond combined. Whilst he has also proposed and approved substantial increases in public spending and borrowing, the £450bn dwarfs everything else he has done.</p>
<p>Prior to the banking crash, people in advanced countries said that printing money and keeping interest rates artificially low was the kind of thing inflation-prone emerging market economies would do. The special circumstances of the banking collapse in 2008 did need these special measures to compensate for the destruction of money and credit taking place in the private sector.</p>
<p>There was also a good case for doing some more in 2020 to offset the collapse of activity brought on by lockdowns. I supported the money creation they proposed.</p>
<p>Continuing this policy throughout the whole of 2021, a year of fast growth and good recovery in the UK, was altogether more questionable.</p>
<p>Some people say inflation results from cost pressures and supply shocks. They blame current inflation on sky-high energy costs and surging food prices brought on by the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>It is true we are living through nasty hits from these forces. It is also true that British inflation was rising well before Russia invaded her neighbour.</p>
<p>China and Japan both rely on a lot of imports of energy but they still have inflation around two per cent, not near ten per cent. They did not allow a surge in money growth in 2020-2021, whereas the UK along with the US and EU did decide on a bulge in money growth, resulting in part from the money creation undertaken by the Bank.</p>
<p>Some people say inflation results from excess demand. If people have too much spending power for the capacity in the economy then prices rise quickly.</p>
<p>We can see some of this at work, as hospitality, travel and leisure businesses struggle to recruit enough labour to meet rising demand and need to pay higher wages and more for supplies.</p>
<p>The Bank points out in its defence to the charge that it has dropped the ball on inflation that there is little it can do if Russia disrupts energy and food markets. The only thing it can do if the economy is running too hot is to jack up interest rates to slow everything down.</p>
<p>There is some truth in these defences. It shows that countering inflation cannot be left to the Bank alone.</p>
<p>We need a supply side strategy from the whole of government to produce more energy, food, and other goods and services here at home to bring demand and supply into better balance. The Chancellor needs to produce policies which promote growth. Constantly hiking taxes and inventing new taxes will stifle investment, not encourage it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Bank does need to ask itself some tough questions about money. Why does it not have a target for money growth? Why does it ignore the impact of more created pounds and more credit on demand and prices?</p>
<p>It will be the Chancellor who has to tell us how the huge bond portfolio is doing, now bond prices have fallen markedly.</p>

<p>As patron of the ladies teams at Seven Sisters RFC, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1523655769887027202?cxt=HHwWhMC5wbO2jqUqAAAA">I watched the first team play</a> Ynysddu Ladies at the Seven Sisters RFC ground. The weather was glorious and we were treated to a fantastic display of skilful, open rugby by all players. It was more like a sevens match. My team won 89 points to 7, with 3 tries each for Melissa Gnojek and Nia Harries, 2 tries each for Lowry Davies, Jami Davies and Cari Pritchard, and 1 try each for Chris Llewelyn, Holly Cooper and Rachel Rees, who also converted 7 of the tries. Massive congratulations to Caris who made her senior debut. Captain Bethan Howell is an exceptional leader, and she is so proud of her team. So too is their coach Julian Hopkins, former star player for Abercraf and Ystradgynlais.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I welcomed the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies MP, to the Global Centre of Rail Excellence in Onllwyn. Simon Jones, the Director of GCRE Ltd, gave a presentation of the work so far and the future plans for this first and only test track and infrastructure for trains operating with use of alternative technologies to be built in the UK. We gave David a warm Neath welcome and a tour of the site. He didn’t know much about the proposal before his visit, but he appreciated the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of this once in a lifetime project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Westminster, my week began with a visit to the <a href="https://twitter.com/MigraineTrust/status/1526569269437284354?cxt=HHwWhICy3bKqu68qAAAA">Migraine Trust drop-in event</a>. Migraine is so much more than a headache. It’s a painful long-term brain condition that disrupts work and personal life. Research by the Migraine Trust found that migraine is poorly understood, not adequately addressed, and research is underfunded. The overall UK economy loses up to £10 billion from 43 million lost workdays every year. New calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (CGRP) drugs are available for the most severe migraine cases, but patients must exhaust other options first. In Wales, two CGRP drugs have been available, Erenumab and Fremanezumab, through the New Treatment Fund since 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Hospitality, Major Events, Food and Drink Businesses in Wales, I joined in its Wales Hospitality Week meeting, chaired by Jess Morden MP Newport East. David Chapman of UK Hospitality told us that he had attended a Wales Hospitality event with Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart MP and hotel managers in the Marriott Hotel in Cardiff that morning and lobbied for the UK Government to help the sector. We heard from hoteliers, food and drink manufacturers; events organisers; and pubs in Wales who told us about the recruitment crises, where hotels have capped their bookings to 60-70% because even though paying staff above the real living wage, including £7 per hour for 16/17 year olds, there are not enough workers. That fish and chip shops are closing all over Wales because of the rise in energy costs up 90%, payroll up 16%, and the increase costs of fish and potatoes, plus cooking materials. The Food and Drink Federation told us that businesses can’t attract staff so production across the sector is down and there are shortages. It was agreed that the UK Government can help the sector by: reversing the VAT increase which was raised to 20% on 1st April; reforming business rates; reversing the Employers NI increase; and controlling the increase in inflation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday, I attended six events and in the late evening, I voted to support our opposition amendment to the Queens Speech, which we lost by 248-310 votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At 9.30 am, I attended my first event, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) APPG of which I’m a vice-chair, which was chaired by John Howell MP. We discussed the Ministry of Justice’s Call for Evidence on Dispute Resolution, specifically the question of mandatory mediation. The APPG members put a series of questions to 4 expert witnesses after they had given a presentation: Dr Isabel Phillips, Director of ADR and Mediation Development CIarb; James South, Chief Executive CEDR; Gill Mansfield, International Commercial Mediator; and Andrew Miller QC of 2 Temple Gardens. The Ministry of Justice issued a call for evidence in August 2021, which closed on 31 October 2021, and it included: drivers of engagement and settlement; quality and outcomes; dispute resolution service providers; financial and economic costs and benefits of dispute resolution systems; technology infrastructure; and public sector equality duty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At lunchtime, as vice-chair of the <a href="https://twitter.com/whymeUK/status/1526561995843059712?cxt=HHwWgICynYKDuK8qAAAA">Restorative Justice (RJ) APPG</a> I attended an update on the 4 workstreams which were set up following the publication of our APPG Inquiry Report “Restorative Practices in 2021/22” which sought to assess where the sector is and what steps can be taken to improve and co-ordinate various services to improve outcomes for victims and offenders. Ray and Vi Donovan who set up the charity “The Chris Donovan Trust” in memory of their son have attended all our meetings to support and advise the APPG.  The report brought together over 50 leading RJ practitioners and over 200,000 words of evidence were submitted. We hope that the UK Government will recognise the enormous benefits of RJ and adopt the sensible and practical recommendations made in our report. It was good to meet in Portcullis House after so many meetings have been held virtually since the first lockdown in March 2020. We also had a presentation from the only RJ officer in the Metropolitan Police Force, and the challenges he has faced in promoting RJ. He said that he has been publicising RJ to the force, and will soon be increasing his team to three, which will make his work of offering internal RJ training to Met staff easier to roll out. And he has engaged with the Police College, to encourage that RJ plays a more prominent part in police cadet training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the RJ APPG, I rushed off to the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1527318163360194560?cxt=HHwWgICxoeHxj7IqAAAA">Battersea “Here For Every Dog and Cat” drop-in</a> event to support their #RescueIsMyFavouriteBreed campaign. During my lifetime, my family has rescued many animals, and it was an absolute pleasure to meet some rescued pets, and the wonderful Battersea staff who care for the animals before they are adopted and eventually re-homed to families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Tuesday afternoon started when I attended the weekly Petitions Committee meeting and volunteered to present the Repeal Breed Specific Legislation petition on behalf of the committee and the petitioner Anita Mehdi on 6th June. I asked the clerk to the committee to arrange confidential meetings with the petitioner and stakeholders so that I can understand the issues associated with repealing breed specific legislation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next event I attended was hosted by my friend Jess Morden MP Newport East and it was a networking drop-in to meet the Equal Power Equal Voice Mentoring Team and the diverse group of people who are part of the mentoring scheme, which aims to get more people from underrepresented backgrounds in Wales into public and political life. This innovative programme is a cross-equalities initiative between Disability Wales, Youth Support Team (Eyst), Stonewall Cymru, and Women’s Equality Network (Wen) Wales. I met with some very inspirational people who have overcome challenging circumstances in their personal lives in their determination to represent their communities. Special thanks to Jeni of the Parliamentary Workplace Adjustments Case Management Team who used her sign language skills to help me have some wonderful conversations with mentees who were hard of hearing, or profoundly deaf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Late Tuesday afternoon I attended the AGM of the APPG for Sport. I was honoured to be re-elected as chair, and I look forward to an action-packed programme of APPG events which will include working with the other APPGs who have connections with sport.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wednesday began with the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1528692225508450304?cxt=HHwWgICphdregLcqAAAA">AGM of the APPG for Steel and Allied Industries</a>. Stephen Kinnock was re-elected chair, and I was re-elected as one of the vice-chairs. We received briefings from UK Steel, Community Union, and discussed forthcoming campaigning events. Gareth Stace of UK Steel updated us about carbon costs, renewables, and network distribution. The UK Government has listened to our campaign and introduced 100% compensation for carbon costs from 1st April. There will be a consultation document on renewables out soon. Ofgem maintains that network is the UK Government’s decision and vice-versa. Gareth said that safeguards had been extended by UK Government to 2020 in 10 of the 17 product categories, and it’s time-guarded to two years to allow free trade. The Minister says it’s within WTO rules or class all 17 as “steel”, and protect them all, but this decision has to go to the PM? It’s confusing! Community said that they had successfully negotiated a 2% pay deal for 2021 for members backdated to 2020, and that the UK Government has a role to play in the transition to Cleaner Greener Steel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the meeting I dashed off to the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1527680555273289730?cxt=HHwWhICwtd_XtLMqAAAA">Christian Aid drop-in event</a> and was honoured to meet Dr John Sentamu. This year’s Christian Aid campaign looks to turn hunger into hope.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After PMQs I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1529130102646263814?cxt=HHwWjMCy-cDux7gqAAAA">AGM of the APPG for Industrial Heritage</a> and was re-elected vice-chair. It is vital that we protect and promote our industrial heritage in Neath. I’m proud of the amazing work of the volunteers who are restoring the Neath Abbey Ironworks, and I am hoping that the APPG will organise a visit for its members to see the Ironworks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I attended the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1528421430177804289?cxt=HHwWgsC9zavMhbYqAAAA">AGM for the APPG for Music</a> and was delighted to support my friend Kevin Brennan to become chair. Kevin is an accomplished musician and singer songwriter who has recorded many of his songs and cover versions. In 2004, he formed the group MP4 made up of MPs Pete Wishart, Greg Knight, and former MP Ian Cawsey. The group has produced many recordings and regularly play live gigs. I was honoured to be elected as one of Kevin’s vice-chairs. We heard from Matt and Hannah of UK Music about the challenges that Brexit has brought to musicians and road crews travelling in the EU, including reduced visas and loss of data sharing. Even though events are on again after Covid, attendance numbers are down, which may be the cost of living crisis, and VAT had risen to 20% on cultural tickets from 1st April, which is double that in EU. The Welsh Labour Government was praised for introducing a national plan for music education in schools, costing £13.5 million. The General Secretary of the Musicians Union, Naomi Pole, told us about pay increases, treatment of freelancers, and hotel and travel costs for her members. Most members turn up at least an hour before a performance for which they are not paid, and there’s no double payment at weekends. There is no career path for orchestral workers who are on the same salary for life. Travelling with a large musical instrument is challenging, some companies treat it as freight, and Eurostar require proof of ownership.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>May 23rd to 27th is Dementia week, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1527937994736410624?cxt=HHwWgICx8djgqbQqAAAA">I called in to support the Alzheimer Society event</a> in the Jubilee room. This year’s focus is on dementia diagnosis, and reminding people that symptoms such as memory loss, are not a natural part of aging. I had the opportunity to speak with people affected by dementia, clinicians involved in diagnosing dementia, and I pledged my support for this very important campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last event I attended before the Division Bell rang to summon MPs to vote was the AGM of the APPG on State Pension Inequality for Women. Andrew Gwynne MP was re-elected chair, and I was elected as one of the vice-chairs. We discussed our priorities for the year ahead and pledged to continue campaigning for all women who have been disadvantaged by the UK Government’s changes to pensions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Late Wednesday evening we voted on the final stages of the Queen’s Speech. We lost Amendment W by 312-229 votes, and voted against the Humble Address Main Question which we lost by 312-229.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Thursday morning, in Transport Oral Questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1527242665284321281?cxt=HHwWgoC-4ZjH7bEqAAAA">I asked the Minister for Rail Wendy Morton</a> about the Global Centre of Rail Excellence (GCRE) being developed in Onllwyn to test the capability and reliability of alternative to diesel rail technologies and whether she would add “Test British” to her “Buy British” approach so that all new and upgraded rolling stock is subjected to a fault-free running period before being introduced into service in the UK. Unfortunately, the Minister’s response indicated that she lacked knowledge of the GCRE, and was very disappointing, but not surprising.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Private Members’ Bill (PMB) Ballot was held this week. Every backbench MP had the opportunity to put their name into a draw and the first 20 names successfully selected in a secret ballot drawn made by the Deputy Speaker and Chair of Ways and Means Dame Eleanor Laing MP can submit a PMB which has a good chance of being supported by the UK Government and becoming law. This is one of the very few opportunities that opposition back bench MPs have to make legislation and I’m absolutely delighted to have been drawn at number 17.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My week in Westminster ended on Thursday afternoon when<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-19/debates/321EF2AF-5F25-4B9A-B975-1562B4E5237D/ChildMaintenanceServiceReform"> I chaired a debate in Westminster Hall</a> secured by Marion Fellows MP (SNP) that this House has considered reforms to Child Maintenance Service (CMS). Ms Fellows listed the failures in the CMS which included reading out some very distressing constituency cases and asked the Government Minister David Rutley a number of pointed questions as to how his UK Government were going to address these failures. The SNP Spokesperson Chris Stephens, the Opposition Spokesperson Ali McGovern, and backbench speakers all agreed with Ms Fellows that the CMS system is not working, and asked the Minister some more questions. Mr Rutley delivered the UK Government’s response, but explained that this area was not in his remit, because the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is Baroness Steadman-Scott of Rolvenden, in the other place, and any questions he couldn’t answer he would refer them to the Baroness, who would respond in writing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back in the constituency on Friday morning, I attended a SBUHB confidential briefing which updated local MSs and MPs regarding Covid health capacity and the proposed spring and autumn Covid vaccination programme, plus the proposed autumn Flu vaccination programme. The overall message is that Covid has not gone away, and although hospital and community Covid levels have decreased, community testing has been largely discontinued, so it may be that the data does not reflect the actual situation. The autumn will be very challenging because the previous two years has shown that when the weather deteriorates, the prevalence of Covid increases and this coincides with the period that people suffer with Flu. I spent the afternoon dealing with constituency queries in my Neath office</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Saturday, I was very proud to watch the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rees4Neath/status/1529384378815729664?cxt=HHwWgMC-haq_u7kqAAAA">re-enactment of the kidnap of St. Patrick in Banwen</a>. The event involved some shows run by Roman re-enactment group, Comitatus, and was held on the field opposite Dove Workshop. The weather was glorious and we were given an oral presentation of the history of the Romans arriving in the UK by Comitatus leader John Conyard, which was followed by a display of Roman battle techniques by John’s Roman soldiers which included: archery, axe-throwing, and spear-throwing. All the Romans were dressed in battle gear and later on during the display the soldiers mounted their horses and performed some impressive riding skills to add to their weapon skills. Some stalls had been set up on the Hardcourt Sports Area. The event was very well attended and the children in particular enjoyed every minute. On Sunday, the live re-enactment of the kidnapping of young St Patrick from Banwen took place, where members of the local community played the parts of the Irish Raider pirates, St. Patrick (known then as Maewyn) and his sister Darerca (who was also kidnapped – and also went on to become a Saint!).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many thanks to Onllwyn Community Council and Banwen RFC for putting on such a great day. And massive thanks to our famous local historian George Brinley Evans and local legend Tom Marston for their work in discovering and writing about all the details of the capture and kidnapping of young St Patrick and his sister from Banwen. Please visit the very impressive St Patrick’s Stone on the side of Roman Road in Banwen which was erected many years ago by George and Tom. There is a service at the Stone every year on St Patrick’s Day, attended by George, Tom, Roy Noble, Dove Workshop, Onllwyn Community Council, local school children and many residents from the Dulais Valley.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>



<p>Welcome to this special edition of my email newsletter to provide a summary of the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement yesterday to provide support for families in light of the rising cost of living. With the recent news that Ofgem will increase the energy price cap again in October, it was clear that more needs to be done to help households and those struggling so I welcome the support announced yesterday as a positive step. Below you will find an outline of this additional support.</p>



<h2><strong><u>The cost of living crisis</u></strong></h2>



<p>The cost of living crisis that we are experiencing at present is essentially the result of a series of global events which have driven inflation to significantly high levels across the world. These global pressures include the fast reopening of the global economy after the pandemic – with the demand for gas and oil rising so sharply that supplies were not able to keep up, causing skyrocketing gas and oil prices.&nbsp;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further complicated&nbsp;global gas and oil supplies&nbsp;and a fresh wave of lockdowns in China has damaged&nbsp;global supply chains.</p>



<p>The underlying problems that have caused this inflation, and therefore the rise in the cost of living, are so global it is impossible for any government to solve. However, we can help those struggling and build our own economy. The Government is doing this today through a £15 billion&nbsp;package which will support the most vulnerable one-third of households with £1,200 each.</p>



<p>The Government’s additional support can be summed up in the following:</p>



<ul><li>Raising extra revenues through a new Energy Profits Levy, but without deterring investment from energy companies.</li><li>Providing £9 billion targeted support to the most vulnerable households, including pensioners.</li><li>Supporting hard-working families with £6 billion to help with energy bills.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p>The below sections will expand on these elements and give an overview of the support you are going to receive.</p>



<h2><strong><u>Supporting hard-working families with £6 billion&nbsp;to help with energy bills.</u></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>The October £200 energy bills rebate will be doubled to £400</strong>. It will also be turned into a grant, meaning it will not have to be paid back. That’s £400 directly back into the pockets of UK households. This will continue to be delivered by energy suppliers from October, with payments spread over six months.</li></ul>



<h2><strong><u>Providing £9 billion&nbsp;targeted support to the most vulnerable households, including pensioners.</u></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>£650 cost of living payment for every household on means-tested benefits.</strong>&nbsp;This means over 8 million of the most vulnerable households (around one-third of all in the UK) will be directly sent a one-off cash payment of £650, paid out from DWP in two separate instalments, with the first due from July and the second in the Autumn. All those who live in the UK and are in receipt of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Pension Credit are eligible.</li><li><strong>Winter fuel payments will be increased to £300.&nbsp;</strong>A pensioner cost of living payment for every pensioner household in receipt of Winter Fuel Payment. Around 8 million pensioner households already receive Winter Fuel Payments. The Government will send all existing recipients an additional one-off £300 cash payment, due to be paid out automatically in November/December.</li><li><strong>£150 disability cost of living payment for those in receipt of disability benefits</strong>. There will be an additional one-off cash payment worth £150, paid out from DWP in September</li><li><strong>An extra £500m for councils to help those in real need who are not covered by any of the above</strong>. The Government is providing an additional £500 million for the existing Household Fund from October, to ensure local councils can support those not covered by the above set of payments. Local councils will continue to have discretion over exactly how the funding is used.</li></ul>



<h2><strong><u>The new Energy Profits Levy</u></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>The Levy will be in place from today, and will raise around £5 billion over the next twelve months.</strong>&nbsp;The new Levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25 per cent, on top of the existing 40 per cent headline rate of corporation tax. It will be temporary, and as the oil and gas price returns to more historically normal levels, the Levy will be automatically phased out.</li><li><strong>We still need to incentivise energy companies to invest in the UK.&nbsp;</strong>This is to ensure we are more protected from crisis like these in the future. Therefore, a new Investment Allowance will double the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies, so companies will have a significant incentive to reinvest their profits. Modelled on the ‘super-deduction’, for every £1 an oil or gas company invests, they will pay 91 per cent less tax.</li><li><strong>This is very different from the levy proposed by Labour:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike Labour’s windfall tax, this Levy incentivises investment and raises more revenue. The Government’s Levy raises around £5 billion over the next twelve months.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The support announced yesterday is in addition to previous measures, including</span>: </strong></h2>



<ul><li>The non-repayable £150 Council Tax rebate for homes in Council Tax bands A-D;&nbsp;</li><li>The 5p cut on fuel duty for the next 12 months, saving car drivers £100;&nbsp;</li><li>£200 million per year to continue the holiday activities and food programme for disadvantaged children during school holidays;&nbsp;</li><li>Significantly increasing the National Living Wage by 6.6% on the 1st April 2022 to £9.50 per hour for those over the age of 23;&nbsp;</li><li>Increasing the National Insurance personal threshold from £9500 to £12,570 from July.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>South Shropshire, Philip Dunne, has welcomed a £37bn package of support to help families with the cost of living and grow the economy. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Chancellor unveiled a Plan for a Stronger Economy, which includes an extra £15 billion of support which will support the most vulnerable households with up to £1,200. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The initial £200 rebate for every household the government announced in February will be doubled to £400–and the existing clawback mechanism will be cancelled, turning it into a £400 cash grant for every household. This will continue to be delivered by energy suppliers from October, with payments spread over six months. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Over 8 million of the most vulnerable households (around one-third of all in the UK) will be directly sent a one-off cash payment of £650, paid out from DWP in two separate instalments, with the first due from July and the second in the Autumn. Payments from HMRC for those on Tax Credits will follow one month later. All those who live in the UK and are in receipt of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Pension Credit are eligible.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In addition, to help vulnerable pensioners with energy bills, all existing recipients of the Winter Fuel Allowance – around 8 million pensioners - will be sent an additional one-off £300 cash payment, due to be paid out automatically in November/December.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For the nearly 6 million people who receive disability benefits – including Personal Independence Payments, Disability Living Allowance, and Attendance Allowance – there will be an additional one-off cash payment worth £150, paid out from DWP in September.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The government is also providing an additional £500 million for the existing Household Fund from October, to ensure local councils can support those not covered by the above set of payments. Local councils will continue to have discretion over exactly how the funding is used.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The new package of measures will be partly funded through a new targeted and temporary Energy Profits Levy on profits of oil and gas companies. The new Levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25 per cent, on top of the existing 40 per cent headline rate of corporation tax. To prevent any loss of investment, significant investment incentives will be built into the new Levy.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Mr Dunne said: </span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span>“The combined effect of the war in Ukraine and global inflationary pressures mean the cost of living is rising sharply for everyone in South Shropshire. While it is impossible for any government to solve every problem, today’s announcement includes much needed support, targeted at those who will be feeling the price impact of the cost of living rising the most – and will do so in a way that means support will be paid quickly without complex applications processes.”</span></span></p>

<p>As part of Dementia Action Week (16-22 May), Llanelli MP Nia Griffith met with people affected by dementia, experts from Alzheimer’s Society and clinicians at the charity’s Parliamentary reception to find out more about the
barriers people face to getting a diagnosis.</p>



<p>There are currently around 50,000 people living with dementia in Wales, with a total of 900,000 across the UK, which is set to rise to 1.6m by 2040. However, with diagnosis rates currently at a five-year low after the pandemic, the charity believes there are tens of thousands of people now living with undiagnosed dementia. This means they don’t have access to the vital care and support that a diagnosis can bring.</p>



<p>New research from Alzheimer’s Society shows some people don’t seek a diagnosis because they think memory loss is just part of getting old, don’t recognise the signs of dementia, or are in denial about their symptoms. Though the thought of diagnosis can be daunting, over 9 in 10 people with dementia say they benefitted from getting a diagnosis, for example by helping them come to terms with it or plan for the future.</p>



<p>Nia Griffith MP pledged her support to the charity’s Dementia Action Week campaign – “It’s not called getting old, it’s called getting ill” – which aims to raise awareness of the symptoms of dementia and encourage people worried about symptoms to
seek a diagnosis.</p>



<p>She said: “I pledged to support Alzheimer’s Society in their drive to make the recovery of dementia diagnosis rates a priority. 1 people in 4 have battled dementia symptoms for over two years before getting a diagnosis. Anyone worried that you or a loved one may have dementia, should contact Alzheimer’s Society for advice and support.”</p>



<p>James White, Head of Public Affairs and Campaigns at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “We thank Nia Griffith for meeting with us, and showing her support for Dementia Action Week.</p>



<p>“Asking the same question over and over again is not called getting old, it’s called getting ill. We know getting a dementia diagnosis can be daunting, but we want everyone to be able to understand and recognise potential dementia symptoms, feel empowered to take the next steps, and come to Alzheimer’s Society for support.</p>



<p>“National diagnosis rates are currently at a five-year low so it is so important that we do everything we can to get people diagnosed so they can get treatment and support. We have launched new resources to arm people with all the information they need when speaking with their GP, which includes online support and advice and a new symptoms checklist which can be printed and taken to the doctor to help both patients and clinicians have an easier diagnosis experience.”</p>



<p>Support and more information about a diagnosis is just a phone call or a click away. Visit alzheimers.org.uk/memoryloss or call Alzheimer’s Society on 0333 150 3456 [0330 094 7400 Welsh-speaking number] For callers who do not have English as their language of choice, Alzheimer’s Society can arrange a simultaneous language translation service.</p>

It’s good to see the Government has finally decided to adopt Labour’s proposal to impose a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies, after months of refusals. With the money raised, all households will now receive a £400 reduction in their energy bills in the Autumn. The previous £200 loan scheme has been scrapped. &#8230; <a href="https://www.catherinemckinnellmp.co.uk/government-adopts-labours-energy-windfall-tax/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Government adopts Labour&#8217;s energy windfall tax</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

<p> Last week, at Prime Minister&#8217;s Questions, I asked about 9,000 people over age 60 who died last year because their homes were too cold. I wanted a guarantee there would be fewer next year.</p>



<p>The gap between those who enjoy later life and those who struggle is increasing and needs addressing. Even before the pandemic, life expectancy was reducing.</p>



<p>More than two million aged 55 or over are living in a home with conditions that threaten their health. 4.3 million live in homes that don&#8217;t meet government standards because they&#8217;re cold and damp with hazards which put occupants at risk. In England one-in-five excess deaths are attributed to cold housing.</p>



<p>In less than 20 years, one-in-four of us will be over 65. Almost a million people between the ages of 50-64 are unemployed. They need work to pay bills, heat their homes and feed themselves. Unless there&#8217;s a plan to find work for them, things look bleak.</p>



<p>Many WASPI women, born in the 1950s, whose access to pensions were delayed without notice, know what a struggle life can be. It&#8217;s a disaster for those who fall into poverty before pension day and happening at a time of rising inflation when the value of state pensions is reducing because the government has broken the triple lock.</p>



<p>It used to be the case that to be old was to be poor. The last Labour government lifted millions of pensioners out of poverty but without urgent attention, we&#8217;re on course for those gains to be wiped out. Pensioners are once again having to choose between heating and eating.</p>



<p>How can a PM who talks about levelling up ignore what&#8217;s happening? The government could put an end to this. The PM could make sure no pensioner freezes to death. There could be an active jobs policy for over 55s and he could restore the pension triple lock.</p>



<p>The PM and his Chancellor are wealthy men who can look forward to a comfortable old age. What about everyone else?</p>

              <h3>Karin Smyth (Bristol South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<div id="fb-root"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, has condemned comments made by Tory Minister, Rachel MacLean MP, that people struggling with the cost of living crisis should work more hours or get a ‘better’ job.  The Safeguarding Minister’s comments have been criticised by Karin Smyth as “out of touch”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Around 40 per cent of people who claim Universal Credit are in employment and wages have struggled to keep up with surging inflation.  The annual growth for total pay was 5.4 per cent in the year leading up to April, according to the Office for National Statistics, but inflation rose by seven per cent in the same period and is set to rise further this year, further cutting pay in real terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Labour Party is continuing to call on the Government to bring in measures to support people through the crisis, such as a windfall tax on oil and gas producers and reversing the rise in National Insurance, rather than suggesting people overwork themselves to make up for real term wage losses caused by the Government. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time and again the Tories are showing themselves to be out of touch and out of ideas.  The latest comments by a Tory Minister are disrespectful to hard working people and just goes to show how detached they are from the reality of the cost of living crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is so unjust for the Government to blame people struggling with the cost of living crisis for not working enough.  With 40% of people on Universal Credit in employment, the Government is letting people down by not doing enough to tackle low pay and poor terms and conditions.  What’s more, millions of people already work multiple jobs or have additional care duties outside of work, particularly for women, creating fewer career development prospects.  The Government must close the pension gap for women to create a fairer society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I recently held my annual Jobs and Apprenticeships Fair in Bristol South to support local people into work and improve skills in the area.  Jobs and skills are important in helping people pursue rewarding and meaningful careers that benefit both individuals and the local economy, but simply working more hours should not be viewed as the solution to the cost of living crisis whilst wages remain low and career prospects limited for many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Government should be doing more to support the creation of British jobs and apprenticeships, but they should also be stepping up their support during this time of crisis.  Increasing wages in line with inflation, a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to bring down energy bills, and more support for those who are struggling are all measures the Government must urgently take.”</span></p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2022/05/25/karin-smyth-mp-condemns-tory-minister-telling-people-struggling-in-cost-of-living-crisis-to-work-more-hours-or-get-a-better-job/">Karin Smyth MP condemns Tory Minister telling people struggling in cost of living crisis to work more hours or get a better job</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

<p>After the last few years, chaos has become the new normal when it comes to our politics. It seemed the transition out of the EU and the disruption from the pandemic were becoming part of our past and we were all finding a new sense of optimism with hope and potential for the future. Then a cost-of-living crisis brought our energy bills to record highs and many families have been plunged back into uncertainty and anxiety. It is times like this, more than ever, that we need a serious government. &nbsp;People need real support and a proper plan.</p>



<p>What a disappointment then, that last Tuesday the Government matched people’s eagerness for change with a raft of tired and rehashed plans that will do little to ease the struggles that my constituents and families are facing right now.</p>



<p>Last week, the Queen’s Speech marked the opening of a new parliamentary session and was the opportunity for the Government to outline their plans to get us out of the mess we’re in. But 12 years of Conservative rule and they are out of ideas. There was nothing to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that is happening right now, no decent plan to protect our food and energy security from Putin’s Russia or other hostile states, and nothing to improve people’s daily lives. An employment bill which could protect workers, introduce minimum hour contracts, end fire and rehire practices, and stop people having to work multiple jobs just to get by, was completely left out.</p>



<p>This Government is out of touch and out of ideas.</p>



<p>As our energy bills skyrocket and the government makes undeliverable promises of rushed through nuclear power plants with no tangible plan for delivery, Labour has the plan and the seriousness to deliver an energy reform that is sustainable and ambitious, but also practical and protective of jobs.</p>



<p>Labour has consistently pushed for a Windfall Tax on the massive profits oil and gas corporations are making thanks to the huge rise in people’s energy bills. Whilst the government try and defend the billions of pounds in profit for these big businesses and stoke fear about long-term investment, BP’s Chief Executive admitted that all of the planned £18bn investment in Britain over the next eight years would go ahead, even if a levy were imposed to meet the demands of this emergency.</p>



<p>As the Government dithers, I will spend the next few months pushing them to urgently address the shortage of NHS dentists and appointments, so that charities no longer need to intervene to protect our children’s oral health. I have raised the issue of poor access to NHS dentists with the Government every year since 2016 and on Monday I did so again. Six years on, the government hasn’t acted, and now we face a dentistry crisis.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was proud to be sanctioned by the Kremlin for what they call “whipping up of Russophobic hysteria” and what I call fighting for Ukrainians right to live in peace and the freedom to determine their own future. My commitment to Ukraine is steadfast and I will continue to speak out against Putin’s shameful invasion.</p>



<p>I will also continue to tackle the scourge of spiking in the country which has devastating consequences for its victims, and push for its recognition as a standalone crime. In particular, I am working to ensure that the 7.1 million people who attend outdoor music festivals every year – many of them young people – are fully protected by from these dreadful acts. On Monday this week, the Association of Independent Festivals demonstrated their commitment to improving with their Safer Spaces campaign and acknowledging that everybody has a right to enjoy themselves safely, with support and without fear. That’s a good start.</p>



<p>As money gets tighter and tighter and the Government delays and delays, I will continue to push for more relief from this strangling cost-of-living crisis that means proud and hard-working people of Bradford are turning to food banks or having to pick between heating and eating. This Government is out of ideas. Bradford and Britain deserve better.</p>

<p>Kisimul Castle is the most historic Castle in the Hebrides and has been a popular visitor attraction for years.</p>



<p>Commenting, Mr MacNeil said:</p>



<p>“Historic Environment Scotland is not living up to their promises on Kisimul Castle.&nbsp; The community feels let down and is quite angry at Historic Environment Scotland’s attitude toward Kisimul Castle.</p>



<p>“People travel from all over the world to see Kisimul Castle which is reputed to be almost 1,000 years old.&nbsp; A Castle that is set in the sea with a freshwater well and is of historic importance to the Isle of Barra, the Clan MacNeil, and the wider Hebrides.</p>



<p>“Historic Environment Scotland is not working to keep the Castle as they should have when they leased the Castle from the late MacNeil of Barra for £1 a year and a bottle of whisky.&nbsp; We expect so much better from Historic Environment Scotland and I feel that they can’t run away from the community.&nbsp; They must come to Barra and discuss with people what their plans are.”</p>

<p>[Check against delivery]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to speak here this evening, on my home turf.</p>
<p>Now, before I begin, I understand there’s a sweepstake on the length of my remarks.</p>
<p>Let me just put everyone’s mind at rest… my money went on 82 minutes – so settle in folks!</p>
<p>Turning to what this evening is all about… Councillor Tattersall – our new Mayor – congratulations!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Mayor, you will be an outstanding Mayor for our borough. You are a tremendous councillor and a force of nature!</p>
<p>I know you have big plans for your term.</p>
<p>Your theme – Educate, inspire and deliver and your charities typify you…</p>
<p>Romero Communities – a wonderful organisation, who have provided invaluable support to countless people in Barnsley.</p>
<p>And one of the friendliest places to get a brew in the borough!</p>
<p>And Hey! – who do so much for our children and young people suffering with their mental health by providing the care they need when they need it most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The very first time I met Sarah was back in 2011. I was dashing about canvassing for Party members’ support ahead of the selection hustings for the forthcoming by-election.</p>
<p>I knocked on her door.</p>
<p>She kindly invited me in.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>I obviously wanted to take Sarah up on her offer – her endorsement would’ve been very useful, but it suddenly dawned on me this encounter was laden with risk.</p>
<p>The dilemma was such: coming in for a chat, meant taking off my shoes which in turn meant – to my great embarrassment – revealing a hole in my sock.</p>
<p>“Shall I take my shoes off” I said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can just leave them at the door” was the reply.</p>
<p>“Oh dear” I thought – it was actually another 4-letter word, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>I saw coming clean as the best course of action…</p>
<p>“I must apologise in advance, but I have a large hole in my sock” I said.</p>
<p>Now, discussing and exposing my ragged clothing – as you can imagine – was not meant to form part of the agenda for this important tête-à-tête.</p>
<p>Sarah’s response however was both merciful and profound…</p>
<p>“People are more interested in what you have to say rather than the state of your socks. And anyway, lots of people round here have holes in their socks”.</p>
<p>She was right. A sage lesson and one worth remembering.</p>
<p>Madam Mayor – I’m very much looking forward to working with you over the next year.</p>
<p>I have every faith you’ll be a huge success and a fantastic champion for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Congratulations again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, before I go any further I’d like to say a few words about the terrible situation in Ukraine because we are joined here tonight against the backdrop of the most appalling violence and misery.</p>
<p>I know we are all greatly inspired by the resolve, determination and spirit shown by the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>The response to the crisis from our community has been incredibly moving – we opened our hearts and our homes.</p>
<p>Naturally I wouldn’t have expected anything less.</p>
<p>We are of course twinned with a proud coalfield community in Ukraine – Horlivka.</p>
<p>A town which is now fighting for its very existence.</p>
<p>A fight it did not start, but from which it will not back down.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago – along with my great colleague and neighbour, Stephanie Peacock – I learned I had been personally sanctioned by the Russian parliament – something I see as a badge of honour because Barnsley stands united against Putin’s illegal invasion and we send our solidarity to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters both here and those resisting his barbaric regime.</p>
<p>Slava Ukraini!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do also want to say a word about the Platinum Jubilee – truly a milestone in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>The Queen – overseeing us this evening – has been the embodiment of service and stability, a constant in our lives and it is right we recognise her unwavering dedication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen… that brings me to another fantastic ambassador, albeit one closer to home – our outgoing Mayor,</p>
<p>Councillor Caroline Makinson.</p>
<p>Caroline… you have been a wonderful advocate for our community and helped see us through the pandemic. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you for all the work you have done – and will continue to do – for Barnsley.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d also like to say something about another outgoing Mayor… me!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the last time I had the honour of speaking at this event was for Councillor Steve Green back in 2018 – which was only a matter days after I had been elected the inaugural Mayor of South Yorkshire, or the Sheffield City Region as it was then.</p>
<p>I’m now back delivering this address but no longer as Mayor.</p>
<p>Let me be candid, many people were surprised at my decision to stand down, but I said from the beginning that being a Mayor and an MP wasn’t a long-term arrangement.</p>
<p>And I meant it.</p>
<p>Some thought that I would step away as MP and keep going with the mayoralty, but I have a fierce loyalty to our town.</p>
<p>You can’t choose where you were born but you can choose where you want to be – and I chose Barnsley.</p>
<p>I hope everyone knows what an enormous privilege it is for me to represent our community, and how seriously I take that responsibility.</p>
<p>Politicians come and go, of course – and if the people of Barnsley want to get rid of me as their MP, then that is their absolute right. But I am not walking away from them.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why… there is so much to celebrate about Barnsley – but above all, it is the enduring spirit of our people that sets us apart.</p>
<p>And why I hold this place so dear, and why I was never going to walk away from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community knows all too well the arc of history does not always necessarily steer to a better tomorrow. But we also know that together we have the power to bend it toward a more hopeful future.</p>
<p>When you walk through our town, you are walking through a chronicle of our past – lessons in who we are, voices reminding us of what we have achieved, inspiration for generations to come.</p>
<p>Just outside, we have our square dedicated to the Barnsley Pals battalions. Men who stepped forward to answer the call during the First World War.</p>
<p>Miners, glassworkers, stonemasons, clerics – many of them friends and neighbours. They joined-up together, trained together, fought together and ultimately, many of them died together.</p>
<p>It is a legacy that inspired some of Barnsley’s finest to serve. Tom Hicks who lived in Royston – a veteran of Arnhem who helped write the Airborne Forces into the annals of history.</p>
<p>And Sergeant Ian McKay, who was born in the borough – another member of that proud brotherhood, posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his sacrifice on Mount Longdon 40 years ago next month.</p>
<p>From the First World War to the Second, to the Falklands and every other conflict beyond, Barnsley’s men and women have consistently stepped forward to answer the call.</p>
<p>Their story reminds us that the lone hero is a myth – we are all in fact, threads, woven together to create something much stronger.</p>
<p>Walk down the Huddersfield Road and you’ll find the head office of the National Union of Mineworkers – a paragon of our community built on coal.</p>
<p>While the Pals’ struggle took them to foreign soil, the miners’ struggle was brought to their very doorstep.</p>
<p>To their detriment, successive governments failed to recognise it wasn’t just coal that came out from the collieries, but community too.</p>
<p>Theirs was a bond forged over generations. Mineworkers and their families wouldn’t run at the first sign of hardship, they held their ground and withstood hunger, smears and violence.</p>
<p>Their fight is a lesson in the meaning of true solidarity.</p>
<p>Down in our town centre, we now have our COVID memorial sculpture – one of the first in the world.</p>
<p>It’s our tribute to those no longer with us, to those who lost loves ones and to those working-class heroes who sacrificed so much to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Barnsley's fierce love <u>will</u> hold you forever in its heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community was left devasted by the pandemic, I know everyone here this evening has their own story – me included.</p>
<p>That suffering will live long in the memory but so too should the resolve of those who pulled us through – our NHS</p>
<p>workers, carers, delivery drivers, shopworkers, posties, transport staff, and many others. Too often taken for granted but</p>
<p>whose true value was there for all to see during our darkest hour.</p>
<p>Men and women from Barnsley have fought, struggled and laboured time and time again for our tomorrow. Their journey is one we continue.</p>
<p>But our story isn’t just one of triumph over adversity. We are so much more.</p>
<p>Barnsley’s sons and daughters have a long and proud history of stepping out and shaping a better world.</p>
<p>Just look at who was awarded the Freedom of the Borough last month alongside our phenomenal <strong>Intensive Care Unit</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Mat Wright – the musical director of the outstanding Barnsley Youth Choir</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Brunt – the world cup winning cricketer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham Ibbeson – the artist and sculptor</strong></p>
<p><strong>And Katherine Kelly – the acclaimed actress.</strong></p>
<p>Inspirational figures, and every one of them Barnsley to their core.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it isn’t just our people that are doing us proud, it’s our place.</p>
<p>Our town centre has undergone remarkable transformation in recent times – praise rightly goes to the Leader of our Council, Sir Steve Houghton and his team for the incredible progress we have seen.</p>
<p>I am however acutely aware not everyone always shares my enthusiasm for when the winds of change begin to blow!</p>
<p>I remember once being in complete awe stood outside our wonderful Town Hall by the newly installed fountains one summer morning – the sun was shining, children were paddling, laughter filled the air. It was a scene of pure joy.</p>
<p>I paused to soak up the experience when a gentleman appeared beside me.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, I could sense he was poised to deliver his judgement.</p>
<p>He then uttered the following – words that will stay with me evermore…</p>
<p>“It used to be a lovely little car park”</p>
<p>I believe Barnsley deserves more former lovely little car parks – we deserve the best because we are capable of the best.</p>
<p>Anyone who questions that ambition has a short memory, look at what we have achieved and how we have achieved it… as one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In every direction, there is much to do. Just as we emerge from a health crisis, we have entered an economic one. Families facing hardship, businesses facing uncertainty.</p>
<p>The challenges we face today and those we face tomorrow are daunting but like the challenges of yesterday, they will be overcome.</p>
<p>You only have to walk around our community and speak to the people who make it so special to know that holds true.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you take comfort in knowing I still have holes in my socks just as I take comfort in knowing our people don’t care, they are still more interested in what you have to say.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your evening. And Madam Mayor, congratulations once again. Thank you.</p>

<p>This week is Dementia Action Week.</p>
<p>It is run by the Alzheimer’s Society, and it is Britain’s longest running awareness campaign. I am myself a Dementia Champion and will continue to do all I can to raise awareness on this very important matter.</p>
<p>Research shows that the misconception around memory loss being a sign of normal ageing is the biggest barrier to people seeking a dementia diagnosis.</p>
<p>With diagnosis rates falling to a five-year low, it is important to encourage those who might be living with undiagnosed dementia to go to the Alzheimer’s Society for guidance and support and feel empowered to take the next step.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Today, Preet Kaur Gill MP joined with pupils at St Paul's School for Girls to take part in online activities with children in Nigeria in the run up to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Preet and the children linked up with Bomas Academy in Jos, Nigeria, and exchanged information about their families, school life and favour subjects. </p>
<p>Steve Frew, who took gold in the 2002 games and 400m champion Lesley Owusu also joined them at the school for a morning of sporting activities. The event was part of Commonwealth Connections - a partnership between the British Council and the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. It involves 60 primary, secondary, and special schools in the West Midlands linking up with 60 schools across 10 Commonwealth countries. Through the partnership, children explore cultures and beliefs and learn how to communicate with people from different backgrounds and perspectives through sports and arts.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said: “Our wonderful city of Birmingham is one of the most diverse in the world and truly reflects the Commonwealth. It’s fantastic to see Commonwealth Connections promoting collaboration and encouraging young people to make new connections with people from different backgrounds and different countries. </p>
<p>“The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 affect us all and it’s vital young people, as future leaders, understand why these are so important. By talking to people across the world with different perspectives of how climate change and sustainability is impacting people’s lives is how we show how global Britain can be a force for good.” </p>
<p>During the event, St Paul’s School for Girls was presented with a British Council foundation level <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/accreditation/international-school-award/about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International School Award</a> by the organisation’s Senior Schools Consultant, John Rolfe MBE. The award champions schools that have shown a commitment to embedding international awareness and understanding in their classrooms and curriculums. The £500k Commonwealth Connections project is co-funded by Birmingham 2022 and the British Council.  </p>
<p>The British Council is delivering the project with Birmingham Education Partnership (BEP) and the children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust (YST). BEP has nominated its flagship Birmingham Arts School to lead on delivery of the arts and culture strand of the project. </p>

			<p>Conservative MPs who failed to back Labour’s calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers’ profits as inflation hits a 40 year high at 9% should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>Labour has called on the government to introduce a windfall tax 250 times since the start of the year, and there is widespread support for a windfall tax from experts and business leaders, including the chairs of Tesco, the Chair of the Treasury Select Committee and the former CEO of BP.</p>
<p>Labour’s call for a windfall tax vote was defeated in the Commons, by 310 votes to 248 (17/5/22). Not a single Conservative MP voted for Labour’s windfall tax plan, which would cut household energy bills by up to £600.</p>
<p>This Conservative party has made it clear that they will do everything they can to protect oil and gas companies but take no action to protect ordinary families many of whom are really struggling with a cost of living crisis. The fact that inflation has hit 9% is yet more evidence, as if it were needed, that the Government must heed our calls for an Emergency Budget, without delay.</p>
<p>With inflation at a 40 year high, we are urgently calling on the government to create a more pro-growth, pro-business environment post-Brexit, where higher productivity and more private investment is leveraged in to help Britain lead the recovery globally.</p>
<p>In addition to help with the increase in energy costs, we want to help businesses with a reduction in Business Rates, and to bring forward our energy efficiency scheme to retrofit homes so that they use less energy in the future. Our plan to buy, make and sell more in Britain, to fix the holes in the government’s patchwork Brexit deal, and its Climate Investment Pledge, to decarbonise the economy, and create good jobs across the country, is vital for creating more certainty, boosting businesses and stimulating sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Rachel Reeves MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, said: “For each and every day government fails to act, families are forking out more and more to keep oil and gas profits so high, that producers don’t even know what to do with that extra money.</p>
<p>In the midst of a cost of living crisis, this failure to act is unconscionable. How much evidence do the Tories need that a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits is the fair and right way to cut bills now? How many more alarm bells on spiralling inflation, painful tax rises and rising poverty must they hear before they act in the interests of the British people and our economy?</p>
<p>Anything less than backing an Emergency Budget – including a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits – to ease the pressure from the cost of living crisis is a failure by this Conservative government.”</p>

<p><strong>On Monday morning, Local MP Grant Shapps joined passengers at Welwyn Garden City Station to mark the beginning of new cross-London train services between Welwyn Garden City and Sevenoaks, Kent.</strong></p>



<p>The new Thameslink services will run every half an hour during weekday peak times &#8211; greatly benefitting those who commute into London from the area.</p>



<p>The link makes up the first-ever direct route across central London via Finsbury Park in the north and Elephant &amp; Castle in the south.</p>



<p>Passengers travelling from Welwyn Hatfield will also benefit from better access to the new Elizabeth Line which opens next week.</p>



<p>During the visit, Mr Shapps met with Tom Moran, Managing Director for Thameslink and Great Northern, as well as various other stakeholders from across the constituency, speaking to them about the new Thameslink service.</p>



<p>Commenting on the service Mr Shapps said, “it’s fantastic to see this new service being introduced, not only for the wider region, but also for my own Welwyn Hatfield constituents who will now be able to travel into London that bit easier.</p>



<p>“Increased connectivity between Welwyn Hatfield, London and Kent can only benefit residents, providing them with greater opportunities, and making the area a more prosperous and desirable place to live.”</p>



<p>When speaking of the service Mr Moran said, “We’re delighted we can now provide these extra seats and new journey opportunities for Hertfordshire and Northeast London commuters. The new route is a key part of the service uplift we’ve achieved for our passengers in the new summer timetable introduced this week.</p>



<p>“This timetable is the starting point for rebuilding our railway, working closely with our community and industry partners to support passengers and the economic recovery of both local and regional rail.”</p>

<div id="dslc-theme-content"><div id="dslc-theme-content-inner"><p style="font-weight: 400;">The UK Parliament was prorogued last week, marking the end of this Parliamentary term. As is the way at Westminster, there is a lot of pomp and ceremony attached to the process, but, in short, prorogation allows the Government to reset parliamentary business.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parliament will recommence on the 10<sup>th</sup> of May, with the Queen&#8217;s Speech marking the beginning of the new legislative session. At this point, we learn the bills the Government intends to pursue over the course of the next session of Parliament.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Readers may recall that Boris Johnson was found to have illegally prorogued Parliament during the Brexit negotiations. He used this process to avoid scrutiny by MPs of his Government&#8217;s Brexit deal – which resulted in him having to make a formal apology to the Queen. At the time, it was almost unthinkable that any Prime Minister would act to bring their own Government into disrepute. Now we know it was only the beginning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before the end of Parliament, my Energy Pricing (Off Gas Grid Households) Bill was published. If passed, the bill would oblige the UK Government to act to ensure households do not have to pay more for energy because they do not have access to mains gas supply.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The current energy price cap is based on the assumption that households across the nations of the UK consume energy with a split of 80% gas and 20% electricity. However, about one in six homes across the nations of the UK are currently off the gas grid.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The end of the parliamentary session means this bill will fall, along with many others. I will keep on the issue in the new parliamentary session.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, I also presented Highland News Media&#8217;s petition on unfair electricity charges to 10 Downing Street. It was great to see so much support across the Highlands to end these unfair charges and rest assured, I will continue to work on this issue on your behalf.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before I sign off, I want to take this opportunity to wish all the candidates standing for  election to the Highland Council well. Whatever separates us in politics, we all want to see the best for our communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To everyone else – don&#8217;t forget to vote this Thursday to elect your local Councillors. If you have a postal vote and haven&#8217;t filled it out yet, there is still time, and it can be returned to the polling station on Thursday.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Dear constituent</p>
<p>I am writing to you with one of my regular updates about local issues.</p>
<h2>Chalk Pit</h2>
<p>Firstly the latest on the Chalk Pit in Epsom.</p>
<p>I am waiting for news as to whether the controversial retrospective planning application will be called in by the Government. This does not normally happen if a local authority has given permission for a development, but I am hoping that this case will be different. If it is called in, there will be a proper enquiry into the situation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the business which has been causing most of the problems has been sold and is moving its operation off the site. Unfortunately another firm has been using the site as well, and is now applying to take over the permit for the site. As this firm were ordered to leave a previous site in Morden because of noise and dust pollution, I am strongly opposing the granting of a licence to them. After representations from myself and local residents, the Environment Agency has agreed to treat the application as a matter of high public interest which means it will be subject to a much more detailed investigation and consultation than would normally be the case.</p>
<p>In addition I met the Chief Executive of the Environment Agency before Easter to discuss the problems at the Chalk Pit and I am hopeful that the Agency will now be more robust in its approach to dealing with the noise and dust nuisance there. I know that the high level of nuisance has been continuing and will do all I can to hold them to the promises that they are now making.</p>
<h2>Southern &amp; Southwestern Rail Services</h2>
<p>I have also met the Chief Executives of our two local rail companies to protest about the poor levels of service at the moment. On the Southern Route I have been promised additional trains from Epsom to London Bridge, but I am pushing for them to go south of Epsom as well as the service from Ashtead and further down in Mole Valley is not good enough at the moment.</p>
<p>With SWR I am in particular pushing for additional trains from Ewell West, Stoneleigh and Worcester Park in the peak as crowding levels are clearly now bad again. In particular the service after 8am is much too thin. I will update you when I get a response from them.</p>
<h2>New Hospital Sutton</h2>
<p>I have been asked by some local residents what is happening about the potential new hospital at Sutton. This has clearly been delayed by the pandemic, but I understand that a planning application is due in the coming months. I do not expect the new facility to be open until the second half of the decade, though. For now I do not expect any change to local services.</p>

I was extremely disappointed to be informed last week about the threatened closure, once again, of High Wycombe’s Driving Test Centre. Having been through this before, just over a year ago, I remain determined for High Wycombe to maintain driving tests for the thousands of learner drivers in our town. It is essential we have driving tests in High Wycombe, which is why I was thrilled to help secure the lease of the test centre at Cressex Business Park since [&#8230;]

<ul>
<li><strong>Matt Warman has welcomed the Conservative Government’s decision to give councils £125 million to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims in 2022-23, taking the total support to date to £330 million.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This funding will play an important role in funding healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice and other specialist services – so that victims of domestic abuse can get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building on the Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, this is providing victims and their children with the support they need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Warman has welcomed the Government’s decision to give Lincolnshire £1,458,158 to provide vital support services for domestic abuse victims, helping victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Government is providing £125 million to councils across England to make sure that safe accommodation spaces, such as refuges and shelters, can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available so that anyone who flees their home gets the help they need.</p>
<p>The funding Lincolnshire will receive from the Government will help them to increase the support they can offer domestic abuse victims, whilst allowing them to choose how the funding is spent to match local priorities and benefit those in need.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government also announced that it will consult on current housing rules, with the aim of giving victims more choice on where they rebuild their lives. By removing Local Connection Tests for abuse victims, this could help victims apply to social housing outside their local area, escaping the community their abuser lives in.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Matt Warman said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Domestic abuse is a horrific crime, and we must do everything we can to help victims recover and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Government is giving additional funding to Lincolnshire to help local victims of abuse and their children start again – with better services such as healthcare, social workers and benefits.</p>
<p>“Combined with the Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act, we are helping victims escape their abusers and making sure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This funding will give victims of domestic abuse and their children across the country the practical and emotional support to recover and rebuild their lives from this terrible crime.</p>
<p>“Through the landmark Domestic Abuse Act, the government has transformed the response to domestic abuse, helping to prevent offending and make sure victims are protected and supported.</p>
<p>“The consultations we are launching today build on this work and will help us give victims more options to move forward with their lives in the way that is right for them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Commenting, Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try and rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.<br />
“These are important changes that sit alongside the new measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which will give victims of domestic abuse longer to report offences to the police, so that abusers do not evade justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes to editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government has invested more than £330 million since 2014 to provide support for domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation.</strong> Refuge bed spaces have increased by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 years. On top of this, £4 million is being invested in the Respite Rooms programme which supports vulnerable rough sleepers impacted by domestic abuse (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-support-for-domestic-abuse-victims-to-rebuild-their-lives">DLUHC, Press release, 15 February 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government’s landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021 helps keep victims safe and ensures survivors of this horrendous crime get the support they need to rebuild this crime.</strong> The Act defines domestic abuse in law, strengthens protections for victims, and tackles perpetrators at the earliest stage – making sure they feel the full force of the law (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet">HO, Policy paper, 31 January 2022</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Government is giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults – ensuring abusers cannot evade justice.</strong> We are increasing the time to report incidents of common or assault and batter from six months to two years – protecting victims while bringing perpetrators to justice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/domestic-abuse-victims-in-england-and-wales-to-be-given-more-time-to-report-assaults">MoJ, Press release, 4 January 2022</a>).</li>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->

<p>Today Nottingham City Council Leader, Cllr David Mellen responded to the Government&#8217;s long overdue &#8220;Levelling Up&#8221; White Paper, cautiously welcoming the next steps on devolution but highlighting that these words do little to reverse the damage that twelve years of unprecedented Conservative cuts has caused to Nottingham.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cllr Mellen said: “Nottingham people will hear the
Government talking about ‘levelling up’ today, but they will wonder what it
really means for them in their daily lives and what it means for the place they
call home. That is the big test for the Government.</p>



<p>“Words from Government Ministers won’t deal with the
soaring cost of energy and food or assist with the enormous pressures on
household budgets. In April many of the people I represent will see big
increases in National Insurance, steeply rising prices for home-energy and the
government’s adult social care levy added to Council Tax bills yet again.</p>



<p>“I’ve worked proactively with colleagues in other Councils
across Nottinghamshire to make the case to government about the investment our
area desperately needs after 12 long years of cuts and underfunding.</p>



<p>“We’ve always been pro- devolution in Nottingham, but
detail in terms of additional powers and new investment must be forthcoming. If
Government is serious about genuine devolution for our area it has to be about
more investment, better transport infrastructure, higher skills for local
people and creating more good jobs in our area.</p>



<p>“The East Midlands region has suffered greatly over the
past decade with chronic under investment. Our residents and our businesses
expect and deserve much better than the sustained funding cuts we’ve seen and
the huge regional funding variations with the East Midlands often losing out.</p>



<p>“If the government is finally recognising that to create
stronger regional growth that the investment is required I absolutely welcome
that.</p>



<p>“It is imperative that the Minister matches his word with
deeds and begins to deliver in a meaningful way.&nbsp; As a Core City,
Nottingham has much to be proud of and much to build on. We have ambitious plans
to truly unlock the potential of our area and be at the heart of growth in our
region, plans that are ready to be put into action if we get the green light on
funding.</p>



<p>“I urge the government to work with us, to adequately fund
local public services, which continue to be under severe strain, to invest in
the huge potential of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the East Midlands and to
start to deliver for people.”</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, stood up for the thousands of Menopause Warriors in Wales during the Welsh Grand Committee debate earlier this week as she discussed the work of the menopause revolution and how it is benefiting women across the nation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key success of Carolyn Harris’ Private Member’s Bill last year was the formation of the Menopause Task Force, of which Carolyn is co-chair, which will be holding its inaugural meeting in the coming weeks.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Taskforce, Carolyn aims to totally transform menopause support and services for women right across Wales and the UK with three key aims- to improve diagnosis and treatment pathways; to ensure women have the understanding and support they need from doctors, employers and their families; and to develop the school curriculum so the next generation are better educated on the menopause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn has also been working closely with the Welsh Labour Government, who have put the menopause high on the political agenda, to make the  improvements in healthcare and education so that women in Wales will be able to access the support and services they need when it comes to menopause care.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, said:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2021 saw the menopause revolution really take off.  We have already achieved so much in breaking down the barriers and getting people talking about the menopause, putting the menopause high on the political agenda.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Wales, we are so lucky to be able to access HRT free of charge thanks to the Welsh Labour Government, but I’m looking forward to working with Welsh Government colleagues to make further improvements to menopause support and services to ensure women across Wales can always access the support and services they need.</span></p>

<p>This is great news for Andover and the surrounding villages where the most vulnerable residents will have easier access to a vaccination site when their time comes to receive it. For now, vaccinations remain limited to the most vulnerable and the NHS will be contacting recipients.

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Right now, the pros of distance learning in school are not at all obvious to thousands of teachers. It seems that distance education is nothing but inconvenience, a threat to discipline and academic performance. But it isn't: distance education has many advantages. 

<strong>Here are some of them.</strong>

<strong> The opportunity to work with each student individually. </strong>

<strong>1) Distance teaching technology helps to find a personal approach to each student. </strong>There are times when a shy child is shy to work actively in a classroom where twenty classmates are staring at him. 
But such a shy kid feels freer at a distance, asks the teacher questions in a chat room, and successfully completes tasks. And the teacher can choose additional tasks for such students, which correspond to their aptitudes, to maintain an interest in learning. 
Distance learning is a great chance to get to know your students better.

<strong> 2) Automate routine processes.</strong>

Simply put, technology can take over the most boring part of a teacher's job. For example, checking homework and compiling classroom statistics. On average, using technologies with automatic checking will save at least 1-2 hours per day, if not more. This system works very simply: the teacher goes to the site, selects a subject, class and topic, finds the appropriate assignment and sends a link to the students, and then just look at the same site to see how they did. 

<strong> 3) A chance to learn new technology. </strong>

The high demand for teachers with distance learning experience is a reality. Knowing how to use interactive learning platforms, Google Docs, electronic workbooks, and video conferencing services increases your value in the job market and gives you a chance to find a part-time job at an online school (and there are many such schools, they are growing and in need of new personnel). But even more valuable are the skills to organize your time, work with students remotely, and be able to monitor and motivate them from a distance. If you can manage it now, by the next school year you can try your hand at online tutoring.

<strong>4) Game assignments. </strong>

Distance learning involves a very active use of digital technology. Including gamified tasks: online games, quizzes, interactive tasks for ingenuity. Let us not forget that for any child the game is the most natural way to learn the world. And older students like these more dry tasks from the textbook. Games not only make learning fun - they help to evaluate progress and bring to school an element of healthy competition. Learning games are not part of the official curriculum, but we recommend that you dilute regular assignments with them. A child who enjoys learning will make more progress than one who is bored in class.

<strong>Minuses of Distance Education</strong>

<strong>1. Limited choice</strong>

Unfortunately, not everything can be learned remotely. In some cases, you cannot do without practical studies under the guidance of an experienced tutor. You can study history or literature remotely, you can become an excellent designer or programmer. But you cannot learn to be a pilot or a surgeon.

Perhaps that will change in the near future. One day, virtual reality technology will allow people from different parts of the world to participate in collaborative lab work. When that happens, the list of professions and skills that can be learned remotely will greatly expand.

<strong>2. Lack of face-to-face interaction</strong>
Face-to-face learning is not only valuable as a set of knowledge. An important element of offline learning is personal communication. While getting traditional higher education, a student spends several years simmering in the swirling cauldron of university life. He interacts with professors and classmates in an informal setting. These interactions can generate amazing ideas and dramatically change people's lives.

<strong>3. the absence of positive "side effects</strong>
The fact that distance learning gives a person a specific set of knowledge can be considered not only a plus, but also a minus. By studying remotely, a person deprives himself of many of the positive "side effects" of academic education.

For example, the process of taking notes on long lectures trains the speed of writing, develops mechanical memory, and teaches on the fly to isolate the most important fragments from the flow of information. All these skills are very useful in everyday life, but distance learning does not provide them.</pre>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

First of all, thank you to everyone who has sent such kind messages to me after last night’s result in Birmingham Northfield. Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

<p>From June 2020 only households with a pensioner in receipt of Pension Credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. This follows a government move for the BBC to take on responsibility for funding the £745m cost of the scheme.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton, 11,360 pensioners across the city’s three constituencies – two thirds of all households currently eligible for a free TV licence – will no-longer be eligible.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton North East MP Emma Reynolds previously met pensioners who would be affected by changes to the scheme, and joined the other city MPs – Eleanor Smith and Pat McFadden &#8211; in signing a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright against any change.</p>
<p>On the announced changes, Emma said:</p>
<p>“At the last election the Conservative Party stood on a platform to keep free TV licences for the over 75s. Now, 11,000 Wolverhampton pensioners have been betrayed by a government which promised to keep them.</p>
<p>“Two thirds of Wolverhampton’s pensioners are to lose their free TV licence as a direct result of the government forcing the BBC to take on the cost. The £745m cost of the universal scheme is around a fifth of the BBC’s entire budget, and the government were warned the BBC could not take on this cost and keep the scheme in full. When Labour brought in free TV licences, it was government policy so the government rightly covered the cost. </p>
<p>“It is plain wrong that Boris Johnson is championing big tax cuts for the wealthy, while all but the poorest of pensioners now face having to pay for their TV licence. According to Age UK, 400,000 over 75s neither meet nor speak to family and friends every week. When I met with local pensioners, they told me how essential a TV is. A TV is often their only form of companionship, and the only way of knowing what is happening outside their home.”</p>

              <h3>Mhairi Black (Paisley and Renfrewshire South)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

              <h3>Matthew Pennycook (Greenwich and Woolwich)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
