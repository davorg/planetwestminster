              <h3>Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>The concerned countdown to Brexit is on, states Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil who says we must brace ourselves for the major impacts this will have on day to day life and the economy. </p>



<p>People must also understand that neither Deal or No Deal is a good option and puts the UK in a worse trading position than any major European nation.</p>



<p>Speaking ahead of crunch meetings between UK PM Boris Johnson’s final round of talks with President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, Mr MacNeil says he is pessimistic for what lies ahead.</p>



<p>He has had talks with many bodies across industries in his capacity as Chair of the International Trade Committee of the House of Commons and none have outlined the benefits of Brexit, whether the outcome is Deal or No Deal.</p>



<p>He said: “I have had many conversations about Brexit over the last couple of years, they have got worse and more intensely concerning as time goes on.</p>



<p>“Industries are actually complaining that the UK Government is not listening to them.</p>



<p>“Many people will have heard the news that Honda have stopped manufacturing due to a lack of parts. This is no major surprise, manufacturing in the UK is going to be severely impacted by Brexit, especially just in time manufacturing relying on truckloads of components daily arriving at factories.</p>



<p><strong>Haulage</strong></p>



<p>“The most pivotal news comes from the Road Haulage Association who have an overview of traffic coming in and out of the UK and I think it is worth repeating some of things they have told me.</p>



<p>“85% of haulage to the UK is from EU lorries, 35% of those are Polish, 16% Spanish, with Slovak and Lithuanian being the next biggest groups.</p>



<p>“These carriers are paid by the kilometre; they have debt on tractor units, so they need to keep moving to be earning. Clearly with border friction and talk of tailbacks of up to 70 miles with two days to be cleared &#8211; in a worst-case scenario &#8211; does not make the UK an attractive destination for them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The Road Haulage Association estimates that traffic between this part of Europe across the English Channel to continent of Europe will be between 65 and 85% if there is a deal and between 40 and 65% if there is no deal.</p>



<p>“The reality is that there is plenty of work for these lorries across Europe so to pay the debts on lorries, they don’t need to be parked up in Calais or Dover and not earning money. This is one of the likely coming harsh realities.”</p>



<p><strong>Poultry</strong></p>



<p>“Speaking to the British Poultry Council – deal or no deal, the price of chicken is going up. It will go up 5% in the case of a deal or 25% if No Deal as they find cost inputs rising as they lose part of their Euro markets for some of the meat that would have been sold.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Animal medicine</strong></p>



<p>“81% of animal medicines come from EU, this is a concern for sheep producers. That was been brought to my attention by those in animal veterinary services. This could become problem in the New Year as well.</p>



<p><strong>Tariffs</strong></p>



<p>“Tariffs may or may not be there depending if there is Deal or No Deal, but there will certainly be border friction, due to the many non-tariff barriers. The UK will be about the only sizable country in Europe outside both the Customs Union and Single Market.&nbsp; Even traditional outliers of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland being in the Single Market will have more developed relationships with the EU than the UK, this is clearly going to impact trade.”</p>



<p><strong>Transportation costs</strong></p>



<p>“The cost of pallets is also going up, transportation of goods which have to be heat treated for travel at certain temperatures and their cost may double per wooden pallet.”</p>



<p><strong>Driving permit and insurance</strong></p>



<p>“For those who wish to travel to EU they will need an international driving licence, an international driving permit which is available at Post Office’s because the UK driving licence will no longer be acceptable in the EU anymore.</p>



<p>“Drivers may also need a “Green Card” to show car insurance abroad is valid if they are taking their own car abroad.”</p>



<p><strong>Passports</strong></p>



<p>“Passports will need at least 6 months validity. It is EU law for the Schengen passport area, coming in from outside the EU, you need 6 months validity. This will be the case for deal or no deal.”</p>



<p><strong>Health Insurance</strong></p>



<p>“European Health Insurance card is not valid from January 1 and travellers will need to have their own travel insurance and make sure it includes coverage for pre-existing conditions.</p>



<p>He added: “Essentially the easy right to free movement is gone and its evaporation is creating a lot of difficulties, a lot of form filling, a lot of costs are all going to be in the way and this is all thanks to the stupidity of Brexit hidden by the misinformation of leading Brexiteers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I did note also in the news in the last few days, one of the leading Brexiteer voices, Jim Radcliffe, Chief Executive of INEOS, who is developing an off road vehicle, unbelievably he has chosen to construct it in France which is in the EU, as opposed to constructing in the UK.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“It just about sums up the crazy situation the UK finds itself in now.</p>



<p>“The best advice would be to abandon Brexit at this stage but unfortunately that doesn’t look to be happening.</p>



<p>“Now more than ever it makes sense for Scotland to be a normal independent nation, we in Scotland voted against this crazy choice but the expected worst impacted area in all of the UK and Europe from Brexit will be the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.</p>



<p>“In short, food prices are going up, haulage is more difficult and general everyday hassles will be increasing.”</p>

<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish, is supporting the Sexual Exploitation Bill introduced today in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bill was introduced by Dame Diana Johnson MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Commercial Sexual Exploitation, designed to dismantle the business model of sex trafficking. The Sexual Exploitation Bill, if passed, would: criminalise paying for sex, decriminalise victims of sexual exploitation; criminalise enabling or profiting from the sexual exploitation of others; and provide support services for victims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adoption of the Sexual Exploitation Bill would bring legislation in England and Wales in line with that of Northern Ireland, France, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Israel and Iceland – all countries that have adopted ‘demand reduction’ legislation to combat the demand for sex trafficking and sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of the Sexual Exploitation Bill comes in the wake of Dame Diana’s statements condemning “industrial scale” sexual exploitation of Romanian women by men in the UK. Evidence provided to Dame Diana’s All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) revealed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Over two years, Leicestershire police visited 156 brothels, encountering 421 women &#8211; 86% of whom were from Romania.</li>
<li>Northumbria Police visited 81 brothels over two years, and of the 259 women they encountered in the brothels, 75% were Romanian.</li>
<li>The Police Foundation identified 65 brothels in Bristol over a two-year period. 83% of the women selling sex in the brothels were non-British nationals. The most common nationality recorded was Romanian.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The APPG also found that the modus operandi of sex trafficking groups in the UK involves advertising victims to sex buyers on commercial pimping websites and moving them around networks of pop-up brothels and hotel rooms to be abused for profit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ahead of the introduction of the Sexual Exploitation Bill, Dame Diana Johnson MP said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Right now, the UK is a high-value, low-risk destination for sex traffickers. That is because our law fails to discourage the demand that drives sexual exploitation and allows ruthless companies to facilitate and profit from it. Commercial pimping websites operate free from criminal sanction, enabling sex traffickers to quickly and easily advertise their victims to sex buyers across the country. The minority of men who pay for sex do so with impunity, funding organised crime groups and causing untold suffering to their victims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My bill will bust the business model of sex trafficking in the UK. It will combat demand by criminalising paying for sex and prevent ruthless individuals from facilitating and profiting from the sexual exploitation of others. Crucially, this bill will also decriminalise victims of sexual exploitation and provide the support they need to rebuild their lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Diane Martin CBE, a survivor of sex trafficking and prostitution, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“I strongly welcome Dame Diana’s Sexual Exploitation Bill. I was exploited through supposed ‘high class’ prostitution and then trafficked overseas. Since escaping my traffickers, I have spent over two decades supporting women to exit prostitution and deal with the ongoing trauma they are left with. The UK needs to criminalise paying for sex because it is the demand that fuels the exploitation that is the sex industry. Without demand from sex buyers, there would be no supply of vulnerable women and girls to be exploited in prostitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want to be part of a society that rejects the idea that people are for sale, commodities to be bought and sold by men who believe that this is their right and entitlement. I want it to be near impossible for organised crime, pimps and punters to operate here and, if they do, to face the consequences.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Andrew Gwynne said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted that Dame Diana Johnson&#8217;s Sexual Exploitation Bill passed its first reading in Parliament today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is vital that we stamp out sex trafficking and this Bill would go a long way to busting the business models of so many sex traffickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a really complex and difficult issue, but I think that this Bill is a really important step in the right direction and I hope that the Government gives it parliamentary time so that these thorny issues can be debated properly and vital action finally taken.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>MP for Beverley and Holderness, Graham Stuart, has welcomed the news that Castle Hill Hospital is one of around 50 Covid-19 vaccination hubs in the country. From today, patients in the area will start to be vaccinated against coronavirus in what is a key turning point in the fight against the disease.</p>
<p>People aged 80 and over, care home, and NHS workers who are at higher risk will all be among the first to receive the jab. Patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient will be offered the jab, while hospitals will also begin to invite over-80s and care home staff to the hub to receive theirs. All those who are vaccinated will need a booster jab 21 days later.</p>
<p>The vaccine, developed by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech, was approved by the independent Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency on 2nd December – paving the way for the start of the biggest immunisation programme in the UK’s history.</p>
<p>The UK has secured 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the first of which arrived from Belgium on 4th December. It needs to be stored at -70°C before being thawed out and then can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. Advice on how best to distribute the vaccine in light of these logistical challenges has been provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations &amp; Immunisations.</p>
<p>Graham said, “This really is wonderful news and is testament to the hard work of those involved to get this out so soon. The NHS has now delivered the first clinically-approved vaccination less than a year after the first case of Covid-19 was diagnosed, which really is incredible.</p>
<p>“I immediately contacted the CEO of the Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust as I was keen to ensure my constituents weren’t overlooked in the vaccine rollout, and was very reassured to learn that Castle Hill had been chosen as one of the 50 or so hubs. It’s great news for all those who’re more susceptible to Covid-19 in our area.</p>
<p>“I think all of our hearts were warmed by the pictures of Maggie Keenan becoming the first person in the world to receive the vaccine, and while the fight might not be over yet, it certainly is good to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, I can’t stress enough how crucial it is that we continue to follow the guidelines on staying 2 metres apart, washing our hands more thoroughly, and wearing face coverings – these are all key to keeping the spread of Covid down while the most vulnerable are protected.</p>
<p>“I’d also urge all those eligible for either the Covid vaccine or their flu jab, to get theirs as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Welwyn Hatfield MP and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently visited Halfords autocentres in Welwyn Garden City to have the first ever ‘green number plate’ fitted. This comes as the country prepares for the mass adoption of electric vehicles ahead of the UK ending its contribution to climate change by 2050.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The number plate consists of a green coloured flash on the left-hand side of the plate to designate the vehicle as having zero emissions at tailpipe. The plates are now available to the general public and will be included with all new zero-emissions-vehicles unless customers choose to opt out.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said the move “Underlined the Government’s commitment to tackling poor air quality in the UK’s towns and cities. It builds on last month’s announcement to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise these vehicles.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of the new plates on UK roads will raise awareness of the growing number of zero emission vehicles, as well as helping motorists benefit from possible local initiatives such as special parking spaces and cost-free entry into zero-emission zones such as the one in London.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Shapps said: “A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Green number plates could unlock a number of incentives for drivers and increase awareness of cleaner vehicles on our roads, showing people that a greener transport future is within our grasp.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph --> <!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re supporting small businesses to develop the transport tech of the future through a multi-million-pound investment, ensuring that&nbsp;UK&nbsp;businesses remain at the forefront of low carbon innovation and research.’’</p>
<p>A video was produced during the visit, which can be viewed below:<span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah rejects Government claim the North East is Tory</strong></p>
<p>During questions in the House of Commons today, Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, claimed that “the North East was Tory” as they “stand up for workers.” Gove made this claim whilst avoiding a question on Brexit and businesses by Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah.</p>
<p>In this exchange, Chi was highlighting the challenges small businesses are facing in the North East, uncertainty over Brexit, lack of support as they endure Tier 3 Covid-19 measures and the exclusion of some business owners from any pandemic support.</p>
<p>Chi said<strong>: <em>The Tories don&#8217;t stand up for workers, in fact they want a race to the bottom on workers’ rights as well as the food we eat to the detriment of local farmers.  This exchange shows just how arrogant and complacent they are</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transcription of Question: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Chi Onwurah: </strong></p>
<p>“The Government’s “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign looks lovely, but it does not answer the question: get ready for what? Deal? No deal? What deal? Businesses have a pandemic to deal with. Will the right hon. Gentleman admit that the combination of Brexit shambles with the absence of proper support for small businesses facing covid-19 measures, and the total exclusion from support of so many businesses, means that the Government are totally letting down small businesses in the north-east and across the country?”</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gove:</strong></p>
<p>“It will probably not surprise the hon. Lady to learn that I do not agree with her. When it comes to Brexit transition, we know that because we are leaving the single market and the customs union, and whether or not we secure a free trade agreement, much of what most businesses need to do is broadly the same, and of course the Government stand ready to help businesses to adjust.</p>
<p>“The fate and the future of businesses in the north-east are very dear to me, having lived and worked in Newcastle in the past. It is striking how many of those who work for businesses in the north-east voted Conservative just 12 months ago, which is why Conservative MPs in Blyth Valley, in Bishop Auckland, in Redcar and across the north-east are standing up. I will mention more constituencies that the Conservatives won if the hon. Lady likes: North West Durham, with Consett, is now a Conservative constituency; Sedgefield, with Spennymoor, is now a Conservative constituency. Anyway, as the hon. Lady and the House know, the north-east is Tory, and that is because we stand up for workers.”</p>

<p>I came to this debate expecting to hear the Minister set out a vision of post-Brexit Britain, how the taxation system will be transformed and how VAT will be changed to encourage our businesses and give our consumers a better time. Instead, we have six resolutions that are mainly about trying to make sure that the Government can get even more VAT out of people after we have left than before. The Government could have done that at any time. Where is the vision that we will have a much better tax system after Brexit?</p>



<p>We are taking back control of VAT, which was almost entirely under EU control. The Government say, for example, they wish to be a green Government, but these measures will not even take VAT off a whole series of green products, which should not have VAT on them if the Government are trying to encourage people to insulate their homes, change their boiler controls or put in more fuel-efficient ways of heating their homes. The Minister has failed this very simple test.</p>



<p>We have six resolutions about a piece of legislation which we are not allowed to see until after the debate. It is a piece of legislation that will be very complex, because it is mainly about the techniques of raising revenue and making sure that no revenue escapes. However, the Brexit voters out there—the majority in the country—have had to vote three times now for Brexit to make it clear to the House of Commons that they want even this House of Commons to be in charge, even though there are still too many MPs on the Opposition Benches who hate the idea of this country legislating for and governing itself and think that every law that comes from Europe is wise and necessary and every law that is made here is somehow inappropriate.</p>



<p>We want our Ministers to say, “No, we are the people’s representatives. We had the majority in the election and we are going to transform our country’s economy, recover the economy from covid-19 and level up the country.” That requires bold and visionary leadership and it certainly requires pretty fundamental tax changes. VAT rates on some things are too high. VAT should not be imposed on some things at all.</p>



<p>We need to remodel that tax. We need to look again at our corporate taxes, where a series of judgments by the European Court of Justice prevented this country levying all the corporate taxes that it wished to raise.</p>



<p><strong>Patrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP):</strong> I probably should not rise to the bait, but does the right hon. Gentleman honestly think that the way the Government are treating the House tonight is an expression of parliamentary sovereignty? Is this what he really campaigned for over all these years, so that the Government could fast-track major financial legislation, bounce it through the House of Commons, not give us the information we are looking for and not subject it to proper debate? Is that what he campaigned for all these years?</p>



<p><strong>John Redwood:</strong> The answer is that I campaigned for this Parliament to take control and use it in the interests of the people, which is why I am making the speech that I am making. Why does the hon. Gentleman not listen to it instead of planning an intervention for a speech I am not making? I am urging the Government to take back control and use it in the way that the public would like to see them use it.</p>



<p>I must take up the point of sovereignty. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash) is quite right to go back to that. The simple truth about Brexit is that Brexit voters knew exactly what we were voting for. We understood the slogan “Take back control”, and we think control—the right of self-government, the right to trust people in these Houses of Parliament to make decisions for us or the right to throw them out if they are useless—is fundamental to our freedoms and living in a democracy. You do not bargain those away in some kind of dispute about tariffs. You do not argue about those in the context of making compromises.</p>



<p>This is the fundamental truth of Brexit. Like practically every other country in the world that is not a member of the EU, we just want to be free to make those decisions and laws that we can make and have representative institutions—a great Parliament—in order to do that. We clearly need to train some of the parliamentarians in the idea that we can make better laws here than people can make for us abroad and that we can modify European laws that we currently have so that they work in our interests better.</p>



<p><strong>Alison Thewliss&nbsp;(Glasgow Central) (SNP):</strong> Does making better laws not start with letting MPs see a Bill before it exists?</p>



<p><strong>John Redwood:</strong> I do not disagree with the hon. Lady. I have said that I want to debate a real Bill. I am giving ideas to the Minister because I do not think what he has in mind for this Bill is going to quite suit me. I want to pep it up. I want to make it more exciting so that we can go out to the public and say, “This is the party that is going to level up. This is the party that knows how to recover an economy that has been damaged by covid”, and that requires lower taxes and different taxes and requires that we use the powers that only the House of Commons has. The House of Lords has very limited abilities to intervene, and on this occasion I am very pleased about that, because it nearly always wants to take the European answer, and the European answer is the high unemployment answer, the high taxation answer and the very complicated taxation answer.</p>



<p>VAT is an extremely complicated tax. We had to adopt its complications and we are now trying to add to those complications to try to avoid items slipping through. We are trying in these proposals to deal with small transactions that sometimes escape the net. They try to find ways of making online organisations, for example, responsible for levying tax between two people trading with each other.</p>



<p><strong>Alan Brown (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (SNP):</strong> The right hon. Gentleman referred to the levelling-up agenda. On rough figures, we have had 50 years of the EU, 20 years of devolution and over 300 years of the Union. Why are devolution and the EU to blame for the requirement to level up when, quite clearly, the Union is at the heart of the problem?</p>



<p><strong>John Redwood:</strong> I do not agree, and nor did Scottish voters when they were asked this question. We do have a great democratic country and I was a great enthusiast for the people of Scotland deciding whether they liked our Union or not. They said, yes, they liked our Union. Then the people of the United Kingdom were asked whether they liked the European Union and they said they did not. So I found myself in the happy position of agreeing in two big referendums with the winning side. It is such a pity that the Scottish National party lost both and has never understood the democratic principle that it then has to accept the verdict. I was on the losing side in a former referendum; like my whole party, I was against the principle of Scottish devolution, and we got that wrong. We lost that referendum and from the day after that we did not fight it, delay it or dilute it. We said, “Yes, devolution is the wish of the Scottish people.” We got on and implemented it.</p>



<p><strong>Sir William Cash (Stone) (Con):</strong> I do not know whether my right hon. Friend can recall this, but when that Bill was introduced by the late Donald Dewar in 1997 I put forward a proposal that the devolution settlement should be decided by a referendum of the entire UK. Perhaps it is some encouragement for him to know that despite a three-line Whip half the Conservative Back Benchers went through the Lobby behind me on that question of having a referendum for the whole UK on this devolution issue, about which he is being so extremely articulate.</p>



<p><strong>John Redwood:</strong> We are probably straying a little away from the resolutions before us, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I will not try your patience any more. I have made my two main points, but just to summarise: we need more vision from the Government to use our power to tax in our own way, because our current tax system is ill fitting and not yet geared to promoting that recovery we want—we need greater simplicity, lower taxes and a lower incidence of taxes to get that recovery going; and we need reassurances from the Government that sovereignty is not something one can bargain away or compromise over, but is fundamental. We either have a free trade agreement between an independent UK and the EU, which is our preferred model, or we have no deal. It is as simple as that. The choice is theirs.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-paragraph-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><span><span><span>South Shropshire MP Philip Dunne has welcomed mass testing of students to allow them to return home for Christmas, and then go safely back to university. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>New guidance from the Department for Education has set out how universities will return students safely to university, after 126 universities have offered mass testing for students before they leave in the ‘travel window’ between 3 – 9 December. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>When returning to university, all students should be offered Covid tests to help identify and isolate those who are asymptomatic but could spread the virus. All universities will be offered testing facilities to give students two lateral flow tests, three days apart, with results turned around within an hour to help control the spread of the virus. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>To help manage student returns over a five-week period, the government guidance sets out:</span></span></span></p>

<ul><li><span><span><span><span>From 4 - 18 January, medical students, those on placements or practical courses with a need for in-person teaching should return in line with their planned start dates; </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The remaining courses should be offered online from the beginning of term so students can continue their studies from home; and</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>From 25 January, all other students should start to return gradually over a two-week period, and by 7 February all students are expected to have returned.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span>Mr Dunne said: “The mass testing of students, both before they return home for Christmas and when returning to continue their studies, is critical to help them travel safely to be with their families and break the chains of transmission between areas. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Identifying those without symptoms will be particularly helpful in this fight, so I encourage all students to ensure they take up the offer for testing in the next couple of days before travelling between university and home for Christmas.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Scotland and Wales have recently set out their plans for students returning home. As long as students returning home to England follow this guidance, they do not need to take additional measures. Once they return to England, they should follow English guidance for their home area.</span></span></span></p></div>

<p>To mark this year’s Small Business Saturday, I visited several small businesses in the Llanelli constituency over the weekend  including Harbour Lights Spirits in Burry Port (pictured), Tinworks Brewery Co in Trostre, Holistic Therapies in Ann Street and Onesta Style Ethical Clothing.</p>



<p>Shops, pubs and restaurants, manufacturers, hotels
and hairdressers, beauty salons and suppliers, breweries and bakeries, and many
more small businesses of all kinds are the beating heart of communities in
every corner of Llanelli and they’ve adapted brilliantly in tough
circumstances. But 2020 has not been easy for any of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Small businesses will be a key part of our economic
recovery and with Christmas just around a corner, people can help to support
jobs and investment here on our own doorstep by buying their gifts for friends
and family from local companies.&nbsp; </p>



<p>I have seen first-hand so many talented and
dedicated people producing fantastic products and services in Llanelli.&nbsp; They deserve as much support as we can
provide and just by making the simple choice to shop locally during the festive
period, we can all make a huge difference to safeguarding jobs and livelihoods
in our own communities.</p>

<p>Last week we were all delighted at the news that the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>I am therefore equally pleased that the vaccine has now arrived in the West Midlands and in the Borough of Walsall.</p>
<p>No one underestimates the extent of the challenge ahead of us to roll out the vaccine to the whole population, but we now have light at the end of the tunnel and a route map out of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It is important however to remember and recognise thought that whilst the vaccine is being rolled out it remains we must continue to follow the rules as a Tier 3 area and observe the basics of – Hands, Face and Space! It is incumbent upon us all to continue to play our part in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>This has been an unprecedented year, and the effects of the pandemic have undoubtedly hit small businesses hard. That’s why I’m pledging to buy over 50% of my Christmas shopping from local businesses this year, and I want to encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Across the Highlands, over 90 per cent of registered businesses are small businesses, and whilst online purchases from large retailers have now become a way of life, I am asking people to consider a couple of simple strategies to help out locally. Could you find a Highland supplier to deliver to you, could you support a local venue, hotel or restaurant and buy a voucher, or could you give the gift of giving by donating to a local charity or group, in their name.</p>
<p>My team and I have pulled together a list of our favourite small businesses from across the constituency, and would like to encourage you to shop with them, and the many other small businesses this festive season:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedrawingroomshop.com/">The Drawing Room</a> is a small business in the Crown area of Inverness, offering a variety of gifts, jewellery and home furnishings.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/speythesnug/">The Snug</a> in Aviemore offers a visitors experience with their award-winning single malt whisky, gin and art. They host tastings and share the history of their distillery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blush.candleco/">The Blush Candle Co</a> based in Drumnadrochit offer hand-poured, natural wax melts and candles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Health-Shop-Inverness-386719128057126/about/?ref=page_internal">The Health Shop in Inverness</a> offers speciality and organic food, gifts &amp; health products.</p>

<p>It’s been another busy week.  On Monday, I attended the AGM of the APPG for Industrial Heritage. My friend and colleague Nick Thomas Symonds MP for Torfaen, who has chaired the group for many years, stood down as chair and was succeeded by Stephanie Peacock MP for Barnsley East. I’m proud to continue as an officer of the group. The importance of industrial heritage is vital and encapsulated in Neath by the work of Peter Richards and his group of diligent volunteers who are restoring the Neath Abbey Ironworks. The Friends of Neath Abbey Iron Company have recently been awarded £2,625 by the Co-op Community Fund which will be used to purchase some new hi-tech equipment – a powered wheelbarrow. The Friends meet Sundays <u>at 1pm</u> for some socially distanced restoration work. Contact wernddu@gmail.com or just turn up. More information can be found <a href="https://www.christinarees.org/shoppers-around-neath-have-brought-a-warm-glow-to-the-hearts-of-the-hard-working-volunteers-of-a-local-conservation-group/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to speak in two debates in Westminster Hall this week. First up was a <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-12-01/debates/5903B706-39C8-4F63-BB83-5FE1A844AA65/DefenceProcurementAndSupplyChains#contribution-75205E5B-B283-4778-A918-E5A3F7696D4B">discussion on defence procurement</a>. Aerospace and defence are inextricably linked and are a cornerstone of our Welsh economy. Last year in Wales, the sector had a turnover of £6 billion, which is 10% of the UK total, and it employed 23,000 people before Covid struck. We have Raytheon Technologies’ airborne surveillance aircraft division at Broughton, BAE Systems at Glascoed, General Dynamics at Oakdale and Merthyr, Airbus Defence and Space at Newport, Thales at the National Digital Exploitation Centre in Ebbw Vale and West Wales airport in Aberporth. I welcome this week’s news that the Ministry of Defence has announced that BAE has secured a new £2.4 billion next generation munitions solution contract, which will sustain 4,000 jobs in the UK over 15 years, with 550 of those at Glascoed. The Advanced Technology Research Centre at MOD Sealand in Flintshire, which is a unique defence led R&amp;D centre, and Thales at Ebbw Vale, which will focus on protecting critical national infrastructure, are two examples of Welsh Government working with the private sector in partnership with the MOD to support economic growth and I asked the Minister to maintain and to enhance this relationship.  It’s really important that in our recovery from Covid, we protect and encourage the creation of highly skilled and well-paid jobs if our communities are truly to build back and work for everyone.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/0e5de682-671f-46f3-a746-008d551b4160">spoke</a> in the Westminster Hall Debate about Homelessness and Temporary Accommodation in which I highlighted that, whilst the UK Government has pledged to end rough sleeping, it is the Welsh Government who have developed truly ambitious plans. The pandemic has demonstrated the scale and scope of the action needed to eradicate homelessness, and the decisive and compassionate action taken by local councils, in partnership with Heath, the third sector, Registered Social Housing and Voluntary Organisations to bring people off the streets into temporary emergency accommodation has saved lives. But the Welsh Government is determined to transform temporary solutions into permanent accommodation and the second phase of this £50 million Welsh Government programme will provide 2,266 people with long-term homes. Since the start of this pandemic, the Welsh Government has allocated three times the funding available in England. Councils in Wales have received £10 million, compared with merely £3.2 million in England. And migrants with no recourse to public funds and sofa-surfers are included, whereas in England they are not. Our policy in Wales is predicated on the belief that everyone has a right to live in a well maintained, secure, permanent home.</p>
<p>This week it’s Electrical Safety Week Wales and it’s really important in the run-up to Christmas that we raise awareness of the dangers of buying electrical products online. Electrical products must meet a high standard of regulations to be sold in UK shops, but unfortunately, many products sold by third-party sellers on the internet do not meet those standards and can therefore pose a risk to the health of your family and friends. If you’re buying electrical goods this Christmas, remember to buy from a trusted seller – even online. Most of the brands that we know are online, so please always buy from a reputable seller. Saving money isn’t worth the risk to friends and family from faulty electrics.</p>
<p>Saturday is Small Business Saturday and in 2020 our fantastic small businesses have had an incredibly difficult year. They truly are the backbone of our local communities – they provide services and products to us, they contribute hugely to the local economy, and they bring life and vibrancy to our high streets. I hope everyone will use their local businesses as much as possible for their Christmas shopping – if we don’t support our small businesses, they won’t survive and we will miss them if we lose them.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about any matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to drop us an email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call us on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but, as always, we remain there should you need to get in contact with us.</p>
<p>I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

<p><strong>Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</strong></p>
<p>Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, is encouraging all constituents to put safety first when shopping online for their Christmas presents this year.</p>
<p>With online marketplaces not bound by the same laws as traditional retailers, fake and dangerous electrical products are being sold to unknowing customers. Containing sub-standard or counterfeit parts, they present a serious risk of fire or electric shock.  In research conducted by Electrical Safety First, 14 out of 15 sampled products from third-party sellers failed basic safety tests.</p>
<p>Electrical Safety First are encouraging consumers to make sure you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller, to check packaging and the item carefully for tell-tale signs that the product is not genuine, and to check for safety certifications on labelling.</p>
<p><strong>Karin Smyth said: </strong></p>
<p>“With Covid restrictions still affecting everyday life, many constituents will be doing their Christmas shopping online this year.</p>
<p>“If you are planning on buying electrical goods please make sure that you buy from a recognisable and reputable seller. Avoid third-party sellers for electrical goods and if you are unsure at all when your product arrives, do not use it.</p>
<p>“I know it’s been a tough year and finances are tight, but it&#8217;s not worth risking fire and electrocution to save a few pounds”.</p><p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2020/12/04/bristol-south-mp-warns-constituents-about-electrical-safety-in-the-run-up-to-christmas/" target="_blank">Bristol South MP warns constituents about electrical safety in the run-up to Christmas</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/" target="_blank">Karin Smyth</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday (Wed 2<sup>nd</sup> Dec) I was lucky enough to be drawn to ask a question during Prime Minister’s Question Time.</p>



<p>Seeing as it’s almost twelve months since Boris Johnson took the mantle of Prime Minister, I thought I’d remind him of this anniversary and challenge him on his record.</p>



<p>Just some of the ‘highlights’ of the Prime Minister’s tenure that I chose to remind him of were; 71,000 Covid-19 deaths, which tragically is the highest rate in Europe. We have seen our national debt balloon to two trillion pounds for first time ever, meaning we are now officially the worst performing economy in the G7. With just weeks to go, our Brexit negotiations are failing, and we face leaving the EU without a deal which would spell disaster for jobs and businesses. Finally, during the pandemic, the Government have given at least £1.5 billion of taxpayer’s money in contracts to Tory friends and donors and at the same time whipped his MPs to vote against feeding hungry children free school meals. It’s a record that any decent person should be ashamed of however, I asked the Prime Minister which of these achievements he was most proud of.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly the Prime Minister failed to answer my question, avoiding defending himself he dithered and blustered his was and attempted to criticise the Labour Party. During my time as an MP I have sat opposite three different Prime Ministers and whilst none have left with records to be proud of, we really have sunk to a new low with Boris Johnson.</p>

<p><strong>Question by John to the Chancellor and Minister for the Cabinet Office:</strong></p>



<p>With reference to the National Audit Office report on Government procurement during the covid-19 pandemic, published 18 November 2020, [I would like to ask] whether the same standard of due diligence checks was carried out on potential suppliers and contracts in the (a) high priority lane and (b) normal lane.</p>



<p><strong>Answer from Ministers:</strong></p>



<p>Being able to procure at speed has been critical in providing the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>We welcome the NAO report which recognises that the government ‘needed to procure with extreme urgency’ and ‘secured unprecedented volumes of essential supplies necessary to protect front-line workers’.</p>



<p>All contracts, including those designed to tackle coronavirus issues, must continue to achieve value for money for taxpayers, use good commercial judgement and the details of any awards made should be published as soon as possible in line with Government transparency guidelines.</p>



<p>Robust processes are in place for the award of government contracts. PPE offers were assessed using the same eight step process, including quality checks, price controls and other due diligence, no matter where the original referral came from. This eight step process has been published in the NAO’s report. For further details please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-government-procurement-following-this-weeks-nao-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on gov.uk.(opens in a new tab)</a></p>



<p>We are committed to transparency in public procurement. Details of central government contracts above £10,000 are published on Contracts Finder. We regret that some details have not been uploaded in a timely fashion. All will be published as soon as possible and significant information is already available online.</p>



<p>The forthcoming Green Paper on transforming the UK’s public procurement regulations will strengthen our longstanding and essential policies that are fundamental to public procurement including transparency, ensuring value for money and fair treatment of suppliers. As part of this, we will propose legislating to reinforce that contracting authorities would need to publish basic disclosure information, including the basis of award decisions.</p>



<p>We have always accepted that there are lessons to be learned from how we responded to this unprecedented global pandemic and the government is fully committed to doing so. We will address the NAO report’s recommendations in due course. As I stated in my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-11-12/debates/46D252DF-18D4-40EE-9AD5-0439F9106839/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-ED32E98C-15B1-4BEF-A267-47FB68033CDF" target="_blank">answer on 12 November (opens in a new tab)</a>, we are engaged in both internal and external audit to review how our procurements during this period have been conducted.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-heading-link-color-mariner-color">Responding to the answer from Government, John wrote on social media: &#8220;Got answers to my Questions on Government covid contracts. Good that all suppliers faced same quality checks no matter who recommended them, but publication backlog of contract details still needs fixing. Big post-brexit opportunity for faster, more digital &amp; transparent, less bureaucratic Government buying process so small firms can challenge big incumbents easily!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

              <h3>Ian Mearns (Gateshead)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Yesterday (01/12/20), Parliament was presented with a simple, for or against, choice to vote on the renewed ‘Tier’ restrictions which have subsequently come into place this morning and the additional financial support package on offer to businesses, workers and households across Gateshead and the North East.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I wanted to take some time to explain my position on this matter and why I voted against the imposition of this package yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>At the outset, I absolutely agree with experts here in Gateshead and Nationally that we must prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout our communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>I also agree that the best way to do this is through limiting social interaction especially among meetings of multiple households.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The package of restrictions are not perfect, they appear to be ever more complicated and the allocation of tiers to different regions appears to be unequal at first glance, with areas in the North and North East subjected to greater levels of restrictions compared to other parts of the UK with similar or higher rates of incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>To this end, I have formally requested the Government publish the criteria used and set out some clarity on how regions will move between tiers while we await the rollout of a number of vaccine programmes.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The restrictions in place since the spring, closing large numbers of businesses across Gateshead and limiting the trade of so many others, have had an incredibly damaging impact on the lives and livelihoods and overall wellbeing of so many people.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government has a duty and the means to provide proper financial support to these businesses and their employees, and to this end, I firmly believe they have failed. While the initial business rate grant scheme and the furlough scheme seemed generous, many millions of people have been left without any support whatsoever and continue to be ignored 9 months on.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>In addition, businesses in Gateshead which have either had to remain closed or have been once again forced to close – hospitality, fitness suites and retail particularly – alongside many self employed workers; have been left with meagre amounts of support, if any, as many businesses enter what would traditionally be their busiest trading period.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>The Government appear to have prioritised funnelling billions of pounds of tax payer money into, sometimes selective, elements of the private sector to provide inadequate PPE and an ineffective test, track and trace system. Instead, they should be prioritising financial support for businesses, employees and families affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Failure to do so has not only had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of so many people, but it has had a detrimental impact on adherence to the restrictions. The Government must understand that many people can not work from home and do not have ready access to utilities and food, and many can not afford to withstand repeated periods of self isolation without proper financial support – Statutory Sick Pay is simply totally inadequate.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span>Notwithstanding the urgent need to restrict the spread of Covid-19, I voted against the motion yesterday evening, as I firmly believe the Government can and must do more to provide adequate financial support for every person and business affected.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have raised the inadequate financial support with the Government since the spring and will continue to do so until they meet their responsibility in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Now that the North East is officially subject to tier 3 restrictions, I would urge all residents to follow the rules closely, as this is the only way we can reduce the spread of the virus enough to move down the tier system. With our infection rates declining, because of everyone’s efforts and with positive news of vaccinations in the very near future, it is imperative that we all do whatever we can to further drive down the spread of Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I hope this sets out my view clearly, however, if you have any further questions please do contact my office.</span></p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>Ian Mearns MP</p>

<p>Today I asked the UK Secretary of State for Health a series of questions about the UK Government&#8217;s response to the Covid crisis; specifically, the suitability of the new tier approach to restrictions in England and how much support is being made available for Covid contacts to isolate.</p>



<p>A recent King&#8217;s College study found the vast majority of Covid contacts are failing to isolate. Failing to improve the existing &#8216;test, trace, isolate&#8217; strategy risks limiting progress in suppressing new Covid cases.</p>



<p>He also completely ignored my question about the logic of allowing 1000 people at indoor events in high risk areas in England from next week. With only 15 allowed to attend weddings, it is hard to grasp the logic of this.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Dr Philippa Whitford</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Many scientists have expressed concern that the easing of restrictions at Christmas could lead to another surge of&nbsp;<em>covid</em>&nbsp;cases in January. With cases still over 80% of the level at the start of lockdown, is the Secretary of State not worried that allowing outdoor events of 2,000 participants and indoor events of 1,000 in level 2 high-risk areas could drive up infection rates ahead of Christmas? Although lateral flow testing is very welcome, given how it increases capacity, the Secretary of State previously stated that the mass testing in Liverpool was a pilot and would be evaluated before being rolled out elsewhere. As the city has also been under tight restrictions and then lockdown, how will the impact of mass testing alone be evaluated? How does he plan to counter the lower uptake among deprived communities—the very ones at highest risk, as seen in Liverpool—and with no clinical evaluation yet published, how can he justify putting out contract tenders for an eye-watering £43 billion and rolling out this approach to 67 other areas? Should this strategy not be compared with investing money and energy in getting the traditional test, trace and isolate system working properly? Currently, over 40% of contacts in England are still not even informed that they should be isolating.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Finally, the Secretary of State knows that it is not testing, but isolation, that stops the spread of the virus. If people who are infected or could be carriers are not isolating, no amount of testing will stop viral spread. A study by King’s College London that suggested that fewer than a quarter were isolating when advised was incredibly worrying, so what assessment are the Government doing to clarify current isolation rates and understand the reasons why people may not follow the advice they are given?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Matt Hancock</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Of course, we are constantly evaluating the impact of people isolating, and how many people isolate when asked to. I would encourage the hon. Lady to look at a broader range of studies than just that one from King’s College, especially those dealing with the self-isolation of those who test positive, for whom the rate tends to be higher.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The hon. Lady asked about the use of these lateral flow tests to have a negative impact on the number of cases in an area. Of course, we have been evaluating this all the way through the study in Liverpool, which is why we can have confidence in rolling out more broadly across tier 3 areas. I included in my statement a high-level assessment of this. The number of cases in Liverpool city region is down by two thirds, but in the city itself, where the testing took place—the testing was of people who live in the city and of people who work in the city and live largely in the wider city region—the number of cases is down by over three quarters. That is one piece of evidence. It is clear that it is the combination of people following the rules and community testing, with appropriate incentives to get people to take up that mass community testing, that can help to make this work. We want to work with local directors of public health to understand how this can work effectively in their areas, precisely to reach those hard-to-reach people whom the hon. Lady mentioned.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Finally, I echo the hon. Lady’s request that we be cautious this Christmas. However, I am delighted that we have agreed an approach across the whole UK, including with the SNP Administration in Edinburgh, with the Welsh Labour Administration and the cross-party Administration in Northern Ireland, because there are so many ties that bind us together and mean that we are stronger as one United Kingdom, working together to tackle this virus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire will be in Tier 3 restrictions from 2 December. I’ve been clear that we must not stay there a moment longer than we have to, which is why I’m pushing for a clear roadmap out of restrictions and for fairer economic support package for our residents and businesses. This week’s Spending Review was a golden opportunity to provide that immediate support; deliver on the Government’s manifesto commitment to level up the North of England; and reward those workers who have kept our country going. It was an opportunity that the Chancellor failed to take.</p>

<p>Amber Valley, along with the rest of Derbyshire and most of the East Midlands will move into Tier 3 restrictions next Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December after the end of the national lockdown. It is disappointing that the highest level of restrictions will apply but this had been inevitable given the level of cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The last week of data shows a very welcome reduction with the new cases falling by over a third showing that the lockdown has been effective. Cases for the week to 20 November were 367, down from 580 the week before. This equates to 274 cases per 100,000 well above the national average. The local area of Openwoodgate and Holbrook with a rate of cases of nearly 600 per 100,000 was the 4<sup>th</sup> highest area in England. The overall average for Derbyshire was 248 cases per 100,000, and England 217. The decision by the Government was based on this data plus the relatively high level of cases in the over 60s and the occupation levels of local hospitals.</p>
<p>The move into tier 3 means that from Wednesday 2 December non-essential shops can re-open along with personal care providers like hairdressers and barbers. Indoor and outdoor leisure activities can resume but groups and classes cannot take place indoors. You can meet in groups of up to 6 in outdoor public spaces like parks, but not meet in private gardens or indoors. Sadly pubs and restaurants cannot reopen. The full details are available on the Gov.UK site as are the details of support for businesses affected by these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Tier 3 decision will be reviewed again in 2 weeks’ time. If the recent fall in the number of cases continues then there is a good chance the county can be moved into Tier 2 before Christmas allowing us all some more freedoms, and enabling hospitality venues to open.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has obeyed the rules during lockdown helping bring about the substantial reduction in cases last week. I would urge everyone  to stick to the rules  for the rest of the lockdown and then the tier 3 rules afterwards so that we can get the virus under control locally and left more restrictions in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p>You can find the rules in full for tier 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#what-tiers-mean">here</a> and you can still register for my zoom residents&#8217; meeting at 7.30pm on Friday (27th November 2020) by emailing nigel.mills.mp@parliament.uk.</p>

              <h3>Alex Norris (Nottingham North)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">

<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>



<p>I am writing ahead of the Government’s anticipated
announcement on Thursday, allocating local areas to the new tier system, to reduce
the spread of Covid-19 in England.</p>



<p>It is clear that strong measures will continue to be needed
once we come out of the current national lockdown restrictions on 2 December, to
ensure we keep people safe and well. </p>



<p>However, it is vital that careful consideration is given
to ensuring the right areas are placed in the right tiers. While we welcome the
way the three tiers recognise that different areas require different approaches
to managing the virus, we believe that Nottingham City Council is uniquely
placed to understand the best interests of its citizens.</p>



<p>Last month, Nottingham was placed in tier 2 before being
stepped up to tier 3, alongside our partners in the neighbouring
Nottinghamshire County Council. At that time, we had one of the highest rates
of Covid-19 in the country. Since then, we have seen a significant and
sustained reduction in the rate of Covid-19 in Nottingham City, with 40
consecutive days of falling Covid cases and counting. We now sit below the
national average for rates per 100,000 population and are ranked 121<sup>st</sup>
Lower Tier Local Authority nationally. I’m sure you would agree this is a
dramatic and impressive turnaround.</p>



<p>Our rate is now 50 per cent lower than when we were last
placed into tier 3. We believe our sustained lower rate of Covid-19 should be
reflected in the way Nottingham is allocated a tier this time around.</p>



<p>Our fall in cases of Covid-19 is a reflection of the hard
work which has taken place, along with neighbouring councils, the police,
businesses and our city’s two universities – as well as with the local NHS. All
organisations have united in a shared response to reducing the spread of the
virus.</p>



<p>It is also, of course, attributable to the efforts of our
local communities, and their support in adhering to the guidelines and
restrictions in place. We feel that people in Nottingham have worked hard to
bring down the rate of Covid-19 in our communities and among our older
population – and that our position in the tier system should reflect this
decrease.</p>



<p>We know that ongoing restrictions will continue to have a
significant impact on our businesses, our hospitality sector and our
communities. It is vital the right decisions are made for our city.</p>



<p>We would like the opportunity to build on Nottingham’s
successful partnership work in a way that allows us more freedom to reopen key
parts of our economy: to keep restaurants and indoor entertainment venues open
and to ensure our city can begin to reopen in a way that is safe, supported and
protected.</p>



<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely<br>Cllr David Mellen<br>Leader, Nottingham City Council</p>

			<p>As we approach the halfway point of the Government’s nationwide lockdown, I want to thank constituents and businesses for abiding by the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The Government has lost control of the virus, and my first duty is to keep my constituents safe. That is why I voted for the lockdown. Nobody voted for the regulations with anything but a heavy heart. I did not come into Parliament to restrict people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>This period must be used to undertake the transfer of test and trace to local public health departments, including a full resource transfer. In addition, the Government must ensure that the NHS and social care are fully prepared with adequate PPE, as high as possible uptake of flu vaccinations and regular testing regimes.</p>
<p>I have proposed measures to protect the clinically vulnerable and providing ‘supportive shielding’ so that people don’t experience the devastating isolation that happened last time. We must also make sure we have simple, coherent messaging with local community engagement as well as monitoring and enforcement capacity to support people complying during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Local restrictions have had a devastating effect on people living in care homes and their families.  As co-Chair of the APPG on Dementia I have received heart-breaking stories from Oldhamers, unable to visit their loved ones for months on end, and who have seen a marked deterioration in their condition, particularly for those living with dementia.</p>
<p>I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the impact of coronavirus on people living with dementia, their families and carers last week, where I challenged the Minister on these issues. I pressed the Minister to report back to Parliament on her trial of visitor testing which starts on 16<sup>th</sup> November in 30 care homes, with the intention of rolling out testing for visitors across the country in December.  It is essential that family members are able to safely visit their loved ones in care homes, especially as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p>I have also been challenging the Government on how they’ve been awarding Covid-related contracts. Billions of pounds of public money has been awarded to private companies often with no experience in delivering medical supplies. The Government’s repeated refusal to come clean about where this public money has left no option but to compel the Government to come clean through the courts. This is why I partnered with Caroline Lucas MP, Layla Moran MP and the Good Law Project in legal action to force the Government to publish details of private covid and PPE related contracts.</p>
<p>Whilst we recognise that at the beginning of the pandemic we needed to move quickly, this does not justify the Government’s wholesale disregard for transparency including the publication of contracts awarded. The Government has now disclosed that at least £17 billion worth of Covid-19 contracts have been awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care since April, with over £4 billion of these contracts being hidden. The transparency gap is therefore growing.</p>
<p>I am pleased that last week the High Court granted our judicial review to challenge the Government’s persistent failure to publish these contracts. The hearing is scheduled for mid-January 2021 and I’ll keep you informed of our progress.</p>
<p>Do look after yourselves and stay safe.</p>

<p>Just has called on the Government to fundamentally rebalance the UK economy in order to unlock the potential of the North. </p>



<p>Speaking in a House of Common’s debate on support for the
economy in the north of England, Judith Cummins MP said: </p>



<p>“Even before the covid-19 crisis, the UK economy was
fundamentally unbalanced. The Government’s handling of the Covid crisis, and in
particular their approach to local restrictions and regional packages of
financial support, has shown that too often the needs of the North are still an
after-thought or, worse, ignored altogether.</p>



<p>“Instead of
establishing a clear and transparent framework of support, proportionate to
need, the Government has employed a strategy of divide and rule.</p>



<p>“We are now in a national lockdown of course, and the
furlough scheme has been extended until March, but the Government must set out
exactly what will happen at the end of this period. They have indicated we will
go back into the tiered system, but many businesses in Bradford will simply not
survive if we go straight back into tier 2 or 3 with the current level of
support.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“In the short term, the Government must ensure that whatever
the restrictions are after December 2nd, there is a fair set of financial
support that takes into account how long an area has been under local
restrictions. For each measure, the Government should produce an impact
assessment by region, which includes the impact on regional inequality and the
regional economy.</p>



<p>“In the longer term, we need a fundamental rebalancing of our
economy. Levelling up rhetoric and the odd project here and there will not be
enough. Trust is in short supply and the people of the North will hold this
Government to account for their promises and their actions.” </p>



<p>Judith also called for reform of the Treasury’s ‘Green Book’
which is used to make decisions on Government investment, as it currently
“skews investment and therefore growth into where it already happens, rather
than where it needs to happen”. In response, the Government announced they
would be publishing the revised Green Book at this year’s spending review on
the 25<sup>th</sup> November. </p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>Network Rail is preparing the final stages of delivering step-free access at Garforth Railway Station, it has been announced. </p>
<p>Alec had been campaigning for new step-free access at Garforth for over a decade before finally securing funds direct from the Department for Transport. Alec will continue to work closely, cross-party, with Garforth&#8217;s Independent Councillors to represent the views of residents through the planning process. </p>
<p>Announcing the scheme in 2014, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “After years of false starts and broken promises under Labour, it is a testament to the local Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke’s persistent campaigning that I can announce that this scheme is finally happening for the people of Garforth”.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Alec has been in regular contact with Transport officials pushing for firmer plans and no further delays. He also raised the matter several times in the House of Commons Chamber. </p>
<p>But today it has been announced that the final stage before construction is now underway.</p>
<p>Alec said: &#8220;Today I&#8217;m delighted that Network Rail has formalised a plan with four options for stakeholders to choose from before the submission of a full planning application to Leeds City Council. It is my hope that Leeds City Council can deal with the application swiftly to avoid no further delays&#8221;.</p>
<p>“I have been campaigning for step-free access at Garforth Station for many years. We had an original plan submitted but this then incurred unnecessary delays along the way but I have been committed to providing disabled people and pushchair users with the same access to travel as everyone else &#8211; and delivering step-free access at Garforth station will help thousands more people travel easily and without additional cost, time or stress&#8221;.</p>
<p>Previously, Garforth resident Mrs Morris said: “We’ve waited far too long for disabled access at Garforth. The elderly, disabled and those with pushchairs have not been able to use the station so we’re extremely grateful to Alec for fighting alongside us to deliver this disabled access”. </p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s Access for All programme was first launched in 2006 and has delivered more than 200 accessible routes into selected stations so far.</p>
<p>A further 1,500 stations have received smaller scale improvements such as accessible toilets, platform humps to reduce stepping distances and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>
