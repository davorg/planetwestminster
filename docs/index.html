<p>Today I invite my critics who wish to see a slimmed quango state to write in with thought out proposals for abolition or slimming of some government bodies. I will  read and post a few longer pieces if they are considered and understand the forces that will seek to defend their chosen quango . It is not an invitation to a longer rant.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to hear thoughts on  the Next Steps style Agencies that were designed to make parts of what is government work more business like, giving the day to day tasks of administration and processing to an Agency under a CEO whilst leaving policy with Ministers. The Driver and vehicle Licencing Agency and the Highways Agency are typical examples. These were activities we kept in the public sector.</p>
<p>In government in 1990 I privatised the Property Services Agency , so its building maintenance work  for the government estate  could be market tested and it could do work outside the public sector. Is this a model for other such activities?</p>
<p>As one time sponsor Minister for the LDDC I initiated the first consideration of how and when it could be wound up, job done, whilst limiting its activities and encouraging  mainly private sector investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very easy for armchair critics to write in and accuse MPs of being idiots in not agreeing to the contributors agenda, or being gutless in not implementing it. The task is how to get buy in and agreement to desirable reform, which often takes time and needs vocal support in a democracy. The forces for a larger state are numerous and well entrenched.</p>

<p>Cllr Neghat Khan has said that partnership working is key to making Nottingham safer in response to a question at Full Council earlier this week, particularly highlighting the role of Nottinghamshire Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner, Paddy Tipping for their work on tackling misogyny and violence against women. <br><br>In the aftermath of the tragic death of Sarah Everard there has been a spotlight on the issue of violence against women. Commenting on the response to this in Nottingham, Cllr Khan said “I would like to acknowledge and thank Nottinghamshire Police and Paddy for understanding the sensitivities around this issue. Nottingham caught positive national attention with a low Police presence at the peaceful and socially distant vigil. In contrast to the heavy handed and violent response in London, Police in Nottingham even took time to place flowers at the vigil. That is something that is consistent with Paddy’s priorities in tackling violence against women and misogyny in Nottingham.”<br><br>Recently Nottingham City Council developed a citywide Partnership Strategy to tackle Hate Crime and was successful in attracting European funding for the Citizen’s at the Heart project – this funded training projects for staff and volunteers, both female and male on understanding misogyny and responding to it. The Council also continues to work to support Juno women’s aid in responding to domestic abuse effectively and Working closely with partners in the Women’s Centre and the Police, Nottinghamshire was the first area to formally record misogynist incidents, the first place in the country to do so.<br><br>Specifically highlighting the work of Paddy Tipping in making women in Nottingham safer, Cllr Khan said “Since 2014, Paddy has increased domestic abuse funding from just under £500k to around £1m in 2019/20 – 14% of Paddy’s total commissioning budget. Often described as a hidden crime, the pandemic has heightened the problem for many. That’s why Paddy has been careful to distribute nearly £1m in emergency funding to services that can best help those at risk.”<br><br> “In the time that I’ve been on this Council, citizens have told me that they want more police officers tackling the things that matter to them. I’m pleased, that since 2012, we’ve seen more police officers on the streets and more police in our neighbourhoods. We have specialist teams dealing with things like hate crime, sexual violence and domestic abuse, all introduced by the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping. But I know that now is not the time to sit back and rest on what we’ve already done and achieved in partnership with organisations across the city,” </p>

<p>As part of my speech at the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services Spring Conference, I am today calling for social care to be treated as part of Britain&#8217;s infrastructure, treating it the same way we would the roads and railways. If you neglect your country&#8217;s physical infrastructure, you get roads full of potholes, and buckling bridges. The same is true if you fail to invest in social infrastructure like care.</p>
<p>We need a ten-year plan of investment and reform to transform the lives of older and disabled people, as part of our plans to make Britain the best country in which to grow old. Our aim isn&#8217;t just to fix the crisis in social care, as the Prime Minister has called for. It is to transform support for all those who need social care, and enable older and disabled people to live the life they want to choose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Labour&#8217;s plans for social care, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a &#8216;home-first&#8217; approach, increasing the use of early help and technology to ensure people can live in their own home for as long as possible.</li>
<li>Empower care users and their families by giving them greater say and control on services.</li>
<li>Deliver a new deal for frontline care workers, to transform pay, training and working conditions.</li>
<li>Build partnerships with families, where Government backs unpaid carers to look after their loved ones</li>
<li>Join up health and social care services, to deliver a &#8216;one person, one team, one system&#8217; approach.</li>

<p>This week we marked Earth Day – a chance to think about the damage that we are doing to our environment and the ways in which we can change our behaviour to make a difference. This year’s focus was on natural processes, emerging green technologies, and innovative thinking that can restore the world’s ecosystems. We all need a healthy Earth to support our jobs, livelihoods, health &amp; survival, and happiness. A healthy planet is not an option — it is a necessity. There are so many things we can do personally in the UK – from ensuring we leave no rubbish in our environment or joining a clean-up crew; considering how we buy products, whether that’s the food we eat or the clothes we buy; or by thinking about how we get around, using public transport where we can, active travel options or car-pooling. These may only be small steps, but by encouraging this behaviour among the population, we can build the understanding that we need to develop within public life to encourage change on a greater scale.

<p>On Monday I joined three APPG Zoom meetings. The first was the AGM of the APPG for Boxing. Chris Evans was re-elected chair, and I was very pleased to be elected as vice-chair. We spoke about our plan for meetings for 2021, which includes meeting the UK Government Schools Minister Nick Gibb to discuss the future of boxing in schools in May; a panel event in June to celebrate women in boxing; in July we shall be discussing concussion in boxing; and in September we shall discuss GB boxing performance at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>The second was the AGM and panel event of the <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/7TmwCxnKDCVP8Y9c8KHCA?domain=zoom.us">APPG on Vegetarianism and Veganism</a>. I was honoured to be re-elected chair of the APPG, very pleased that Vegetarian for Life and The Vegan Society are continuing as co-sponsors, and that The Vegan Society will continue to provide the secretariat. The panel discussion topic was <em>“Out of the EU, can the UK now lead on more inclusive medicine developing and labelling”. </em>Our guest speakers were: Sheetal Ladva a Medicines Information Pharmacist and member of the Plant Based Health Professional Group; Dr Hannah Short a GP and specialist in female hormonal health; and Hira Aslam a pharmacist and founder of Vegan Chemist start up. The guest speakers were addressing our APPG in a personal capacity as healthcare professionals, not representing their employers or organisations. Research published in the British Medical Journal found that 74 of 100 medications prescribed in UK primary care contain animal derived ingredients. Vegans and vegetarians, together with some religious groups whose beliefs involve excluding animal products, are affected by this. But there is no legal requirement for ingredients of animal origin to be specified on medicine labelling. This leaves patients with questions about their prescriptions and therefore lacking information to make an informed decision, and leaves healthcare professionals seeking answers. When information is available the lack of animal free alternatives to many common medicines leaves patients of having to compromise their beliefs to avoid risking their health. Our APPG looked at this in 2017, and contacted Jeremy Hunt MP, the then Secretary of State for Health, and requested that his department look into this matter, but with Brexit negotiations it was uncertain over future responsibility over medicine regulation. Now that Brexit negotiations have concluded, we are revisiting imperfect labelling’s impact on patients, and looking for practical solutions.</p>
<p>Following the very sad passing of Cheryl Gillan MP, a Zoom meeting of the APPG on Autism was convened, for which Cheryl has been the chair for many years. Huw Merriman MP has taken over as the chair, and I have been re-elected vice-chair. The meeting gave us an opportunity to pay tribute to Cheryl and her tireless work on behalf of autism. I paid tribute to her as someone who had become a friend. Cheryl asked me to take over as the chair of the APPG for Sepsis when she stood down as the chair after many years. I was so honoured that Cheryl thought that I could perform this role, and follow in her footsteps. Cheryl believed in working cross-party for causes that rise above politics, and she will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, I joined a Unite the Union briefing for MPs about the closure of GKN Automotive, Birmingham, putting 519 jobs at risk. This was announced on 28th January, with winding down taking place over the following 18 months. Corporate owner Melrose plan to offshore production to Poland and France. GKN supplies major UK car builders including Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota with driveline components which account for 15% of a vehicle. Unite shop stewards working with independent experts have tabled a two-stage plan; a productivity plan to improve the plant, followed by a transition to new products for electric vehicles. We are calling on the UK Government to back workers and intervene to stop the closure; support the UK auto industry supply chain; accept that the closure of GKN would jeopardise the UK’s ability to transition to electric vehicles ahead of the 2030 ban; and accept that closure makes a fiction of the UK Government’s levelling up agenda in a constituency facing chronic unemployment.</p>
<p>The APPG for T-Levels was constituted at its inaugural meeting, at which I was elected to serve as an officer. UK Government Secretary of State Gavin Williamson MP and Minister for Apprentices and Skills Gillian Keegan MP were guest speakers. As Chair of the APPG for Hairdressing, Barbering, and Cosmetology, I brought to the attention of the Minister that apprentices in our industry have not been able to fulfil their skills training and qualifications because salons have been closed for a large period of time since the first lockdown began in March 2020. These apprentices are over one year behind in gaining their qualifications and need to be supported by the UK Government to complete their awards. Furthermore, practitioners in our industry have received very little, if any, funding from the UK Government during lockdown and have fallen through the gaps in support. Practitioners have been unable to trade for large periods, therefore, the Minister should consider paying for apprentices’ wages, because salon employers are struggling. Salons depend on apprentices to help with clients in many ways, and trainees are indispensable to the success of a salon. I also asked the Minister to support the Hair Council, which is the statutory body under The Hairdressers (Registration) Act 1964, who has been campaigning for many years to amend the Act to include mandatory registration for all practitioners and amend it to include the beauty industry. Mandatory registration would enable the regulation of an industry that brings in over £6 billion per annum to the UK economy, but has some unscrupulous practitioners that practice without any recognised qualifications.</p>
<p>I joined the APPG End of Life virtual meeting chaired by Karin Smith MP and Andrew Mitchell MP, with guest speaker Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State Health and Social Care, and members of the public who have personal experience of the current law. The meeting discussed assisted dying and the current political landscape, in the UK and internationally. Since the start of the year there have been huge developments internationally. Tasmania has become the third Australian state to legalise assisted dying, following Victoria and Western Australia, and there has been an overwhelming referendum for support in New Zealand. Spain and Portugal have passed legislation on choice at the end of life and debates are ongoing in Ireland, France and Germany. In the UK individuals have continued to take desperate decisions to end their own lives, particularly given the increased difficulty of overseas travel to countries where choice at the end of life is available. The ONS found that one in seven suicides can be linked to individuals experiencing cancer, neurological, heart or lung disease. There is a need to understand more and gather more evidence about the experiences and choices that dying people experience in the UK who do not have the safeguarded choice at the end of life available to the millions of people in similar jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>Liz Twist MP, Chair of the APPG on Rare, Genetic and Undiagnosed Conditions, organised a webinar to discuss access to rare diseases medicines. Guest speakers included Kye Gbangbola, Sickle Cell Society; Kate Learoyd, National Society for Phenylketonuria; Lord Bethell, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Minister for Innovation); Emily Crossley, Duchenne UK; Jess Hobart, UK Mastocytosis Support Group; Roanna Maharaj, UK Thalassaemia Society; Meindert Boysen, Deputy Chief Executive and Director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation NICE ; and Nina Pinwell, Head of Commercial Operations, Commercial Medicines Directorate, NHS England and NHS Improvement. All speakers made passionate pleas to the Minister and to Mr Boysen and Ms Pinwell to make available and to fund medicines that are available to improve, and in some cases save, lives of people suffering from these rare diseases. As vice-chair of the APPG for PKU, I pointed out to the Minister and to NICE and NHS representatives, that Kuvan, the medicine that has been available since 2008, successfully trialled, but not recommended by NICE, therefore not funded by the NHS, would have allowed all PKU sufferers to eat a normal diet, instead of being restricted to a diet without protein. People with PKU, cannot process and digest PKU, which is toxic to them and results in lifestyle changes that are very difficult or impossible to manage.</p>
<p>After many years of campaigning by Kate Learoyd and her volunteers in NSPKU, last month, Kuvan was recommended in a NICE report for sufferers aged below 18 years of age, for cost effective reasons. The report went to public consultation and the PKU family and the APPG made submissions asking for Kuvan to be available for all ages. Whilst I welcome progress after such a long campaign, imagine what it would be like to be able to take Kuvan through childhood and adolescence, lead a near normal life, and to reach your 18th birthday and have to change diet overnight to not eating any protein. There are so many challenges at this age, without having to cope with such a drastic, cliff edge, lifestyle transformation. Needless to say, the answers were totally unsatisfactory and very demoralising.</p>

<p>On Thursday I attended an EveryDoctor confidential briefing for MPs entitled “<em>Is the NHS being privatised?”. </em>EveryDoctor is a not-for-profit membership organisation representing 1700 UK doctors, receives feedback from NHS frontline staff daily via the 40,000 NHS staff in its network and advocates for the safety and well-being of every doctor, NHS worker and patient. EveryDoctor plans to set up an APPG about privatisation of the NHS which would start forming policy recommendations to ensure that the NHS stays in public hands for future generations.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or issues and want to get in touch about matters that fall under my role as an MP, please do not hesitate to email on christina.rees.mp@parliament.uk or call on 01639 630152. My staff are working from home to comply with the social distancing measures, but as always, we are available should you need to get in contact with us. I hope you stay well, and remember – observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly and keep Wales safe.</p>

<p>The Bill completed all its stages in the Houses of Parliament and has now received Royal Assent meaning animal abusers convicted under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 could face up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>Although the Bill has now become law, it is expected to come into force later this year &#8211; a move for which animal welfare groups and MPs have long campaigned.</p>
<p>Andrew Gwynne MP said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am delighted this important Bill has made it into law.  It&#8217;s right that animal welfare laws here in England and Wales should be as strong as they are in the rest of the United Kingdom, with tougher sentences to deter acts of animal cruelty.  I&#8217;m proud to have supported this long overdue law change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The new law brings us in line with Scotland and Northern Ireland where convicted animal abusers can be jailed for up to five years.</p>
<p>The Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Act is set to cover both England and Wales, once the Senedd for Wales passes a legislative consent motion &#8211; which the Welsh Government supports.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk">RSPCA</a> &#8211; the principal investigator of animal neglect and cruelty in England and Wales &#8211; has been campaigning for tougher sentencing, alongside its colleagues in the animal welfare sector, for years.</p>
<p>Chief executive Chris Sherwood said: “This law is a huge step forward for animal welfare in the UK and we’re delighted that justice will now be served for animals. Tougher sentences will act as a stronger deterrent to potential animal abusers and will help us in our aim to stamp out animal cruelty once and for all.</p>
<p>“Every year our officers are faced with cases of the most unimaginable cruelty: animals beaten, stabbed, shot and burned; unwanted or elderly pets being drowned; wild animals shot with crossbows or set on fire; gangs forcing cockerels to fight to the death; and breeders cutting off puppies’ ears to make them look tough.</p>
<p>“Since this Bill was introduced animals have been starved, shot, stabbed, beaten to death and drowned. At least now, in those cases that leave us heartbroken, our courts will be able to hand out sentences that truly reflect the severity of the crimes.”</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>On the floor of the House of Commons this afternoon, South Lakes MP Tim Farron presented a Ten Minute Rule Bill that would create an independent regulator to protect the UK's world-leading food, farming and environmental standards.</p>
<p>The new regulator would be able to ensure that imports meet UK standards for animal welfare and environmental protections - preventing products like chlorinated chicken or hormone treated beef being able to flood the British market.</p>
<p>It would also have new powers to ensure that the Government and public authorities comply with their environmental and climate targets, by issuing sanctions for those that fail to meet them.</p>
<p>The Government had promised to create a new environmental regulator, replacing the role the European Commission played before Brexit. However the proposed "Office of Environmental Protection" (OEP) has been criticised for lacking meaningful enforcement powers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Environment Bill that will create the OEP has been delayed several times since it was first introduced in 2018, and is now not expected to return to Parliament until after the Queen's Speech.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament, Tim said: <em>"This Bill would introduce an independent body - which the Government has promised to do for four years now - which would have the power to assess the environmental impacts of international trade deals and to ensure that the government does not bequeath an environmental disaster to our children and grandchildren.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"I hope the Government takes this opportunity to protect our air quality, biodiversity and our farmers, key allies in our fight against the climate and ecological emergencies, so that they can help us to improve our natural environment before it is too late.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"To do that, we need an independent environmental regulator as the Government has promised. And given that the Government has failed to deliver that promise, I stand here today to deliver it for them and for the good of our farmers and our environment…there is no more time to lose."</em>

<p>Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, has welcomed the launch of Keep Britain Tidy’s ‘Pledge to Pick’ initiative ahead of their annual Great British Spring Clean campaign, which asks everyone to chip in and do their bit to help eliminate the scourge of litter that blights our vibrant East Yorkshire countryside.</p>
<p>This year the spring clean runs between 28<sup>th</sup> May and 13<sup>th</sup> June, and Beverley &amp; Holderness constituents are able to let the charity know at its website how many hours and minutes they will pledge to litter-picking.</p>
<p>This is allowing Keep Britain Tidy to measure the progress of their ‘million-mile mission’. Over a third of the target has already been met; more than 340,000 miles of litter-picking has already been pledged by people up and down the country.</p>
<p>This year’s campaign comes as the charity has reported a massive increase in the number of people and community groups who have started litter-picking during the various lockdowns. Groups like The Wombles of Beverley (TWOB) have been praised for their extensive co-operation with local businesses and community leaders in tackling the increase in littering. The UK overall has seen the number of individuals actively volunteering to maintain their community grow by as much as a third in less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Paul Coe, TWOB Chairman, supports Keep Britain Tidy, saying “In line with this year’s Great British Spring Clean campaign, The Wombles of Beverley are fully committed to doing our bit in preserving the outstanding beauty of Beverley, the surrounding villages and the green public spaces that have been used extensively during the pandemic.</p>
<p> “Protecting the environment is a key focus of our group and we welcome anyone in the local area to join us to help us in our mission.</p>
<p>“We place a great emphasis on getting children and parents involved in order to inspire the next generation.</p>
<p>“You can become part of our movement by joining our Facebook page ‘The Wombles of Beverley’ or for further information email <a href="mailto:paul@thewomblesofbeverley.co.uk">paul@thewomblesofbeverley.co.uk</a>”</p>
<p>Graham commented, “It’s really encouraging to see so many public-spirited individuals, like The Wombles of Beverley, coming out to do their bit for our towns and villages. Not only does it benefit our environment but getting outdoors more regularly is good for our mental and physical health.</p>
<p>“It’s also a great way of showing our appreciation for the countryside on our doorstep, which we may have taken for granted before the pandemic. So, I’d encourage as many people as possible to get involved in the Great British Spring Clean, making sure you’re sticking to the COVID rules and guidance, which is available on Keep Britain Tidy’s website.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to getting out on our streets this spring with local councillors to mark this year’s Great British Spring Clean. Armed with my trusty litter-picker, I intend to do my bit for the local community.”</p>
<p>The Great British Spring Clean, now in its sixth year, brings together individuals, community organisations, businesses and councils to make a difference to the environment on our doorstep. In 2019, over half a million litter-pickers collected just under a million bags of rubbish, weighing around 4,300 tonnes.</p>
<p>Keep Britain Tidy’s Chief Executive, Allison Ogden-Newton added: “We are delighted to have Graham’s support for this year’s Great British Spring Clean.</p>
<p>“We have all spent a lot more time in our local area in the past year and have come to realise just how important our local park or green space is for our mental and physical health.</p>
<p>“Whether you commit to do five minutes or five hours, every single pledge will help us reach our million-mile target and clear tonnes of litter pollution from our environment.”</p>
<p>Back in September 2020, Graham toured the constituency and was joined by local councillors and volunteers for litter picks in Beverley and Holderness.</p>
<p>The local MP joined in with last year&#8217;s postponed Spring Clean, when he was accompanied by Conservative ward councillors in South East and South West Holderness, Lyn Healing, Dave Tucker, Paul Whitehead, and Sue Steel to tidy up Withernsea’s beachfront and Hedon’s Market Hill. He also joined Mid-Holderness Councillors Jacob Birch and John Holtby to clear the land around Bilton Village hall, and litter-picked in and around Beverley alongside Cllrs Greenwood, Harold, Nickerson, Elvidge and Gateshill as part of a major sweep of the area.</p>

<p>Na h-Eileanan an Iar SNP MP Angus MacNeil &amp; Western Isles SNP Council Group Leader, Gordon Murray, has expressed astonishment at the fact that not all options have been considered and costed for HIAL managing air traffic control at island airports. Especially against a background where political parties have policies, schemes and ideas to maintain the population in Scotland&#8217;s vulnerable communities. HIAL seem hell bent on not just taking some jobs out of these communities, but just about the best paid jobs out of these communities.</p>



<p>The revelation came in a letter from Transport Scotland after Mr MacNeil had queried better value for money options that would deliver what HIAL claimed they need to deliver.&nbsp; These options could prevent relocating jobs and uprooting families to Inverness but maintaining island communities in line with government policy and with better value for money for the public purse. Astonishingly HIAL did not calculate the costs for these options.</p>



<p>Commenting Angus MacNeil MP said:</p>



<p>“At a time when public budgets are pressed like never before, to get a letter from Transport Scotland reiterating that the ATMS project is not a cost saving exercise is frankly jaw-dropping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The letter states “The ATMS project is not a cost saving exercise” and further states that “Costings were not calculated for all options.” This much I know to be true as there are two cheaper options than empire building in Inverness and if HIAL manage to hoodwink Scottish Government Ministers, then each and every year £2 million will be needlessly wasted from the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget and jobs will be removed from the islands, cancelling out any other government spend to further help people remain in our island communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Between the Scottish Government and Audit Scotland, somebody has to rapidly get a grip about what is going on and remove the uncertainty that is hanging over too many islanders jobs at the moment. The hoodwinking of the Government must end.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting SNP Council Leader, Cllr Gordon Murray, said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HIAL need to review their decision in terms of the huge impact this will have on the islands – the people of these islands are ambitious and are our greatest resource, it’s time public agencies such as HIAL acknowledged this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By retaining these jobs on the islands, HIAL will be making an investment with far-reaching positive consequences for communities than if it were to continue its plans. HIAL need to be a part of the transformational change these islands need and this is their opportunity.”   </p>

<p>Worker’s Memorial Day is always a poignant moment each year. It’s an opportunity to reflect on those workers who’ve lost their lives in the workplace. It’s a chance to pay tribute to the incredible campaigning efforts of our trade union and labour movement. And it’s a chance to recommit ourselves to the fight for a better, safer world of work.</p>

<p>Speaking about the proposed Greville Road layout changes, Karin Smyth, MP for Bristol South, said:</p>
<p>“I am aware of the considerable interest in the scheme and have been in open communication with residents and local road users alike. It is my sincere hope that as many people as possible took part in the consultation exercise undertaken by Bristol City Council.</p>
<p>“It’s important that consultations of this type not only listen to the views requested, but also reach out to those who feel the language or supporting documentation is not sufficient. I am pursuing this very issue with the Council presently.</p>
<p>“Traffic management schemes, be them large or small, should hold the primary focus of reducing and not simply displacing vehicle movements. It makes very little sense if any plan increases congestion and pollution on alternate routes. Liveable Neighbourhoods are not just one road and decisions should be undertaken with that in mind.”</p>The post <a href="http://karinsmyth.com/2021/04/21/statement-on-greville-road-layout-proposals/">Statement on Greville Road layout proposals</a> first appeared on <a href="http://karinsmyth.com">Karin Smyth</a>.

I get the idea of grey-zone warfare. I studied strategy; I realise that we cannot fight the next war as we fought the last war—I get that, too. The real problem is that we are going to have to do the next war in a different way. I get that as well.
But we have not fought a total war as envisaged…

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>With four days left until the deadline to register to vote in England, Preet Kaur Gill MP is urging young people to register to vote and have their voices heard ahead of the elections on May 6th.  </p>
<p>Just 7% of 18-25 year olds have registered for a postal vote in the West Midlands, the lowest rate in the country. This is in comparison to those aged over 65 where the rate jumps to 23%. </p>
<p>With less than half of 18-25-year-olds voting at the 2019 General Election, turnout among young people is expected to be historically low at the May elections amid the pandemic.  </p>
<p>Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham said, “In my constituency alone, there are three universities, with collectively more than 55,000 students. However, even with this large student population, the West Midlands has the lowest voter registration of young people by post than anywhere else in the country. </p>
<p>“At 7% this is staggeringly low and after the devastating year that many students and young people have had, it’s imperative that they make their voices heard.” </p>
<p>Preet has said that young people must be at the heart of Britain’s recovery from this crisis, with successive Conservative governments weakening Britain’s foundations and robbing too many young people of the opportunities they deserve. </p>
<p>Labour warns that Government inaction on postal voting threatens UK democracy and public health and is calling for councils to receive dedicated Government support for postal vote sign up efforts ahead of the deadline for postal vote registration in England on 20th April. </p>
<p>With those aged 18 and older due to be vaccinated by 31 July in England, many young people unlikely to be vaccinated by election day.  </p>
<p>Preet continued, “Young people have played a central role in our country’s response to this crisis, with many volunteering to support the most vulnerable in our communities and fighting as key workers on the front line to protect our families. The Tories continue to treat young people as an afterthought in this crisis – these are our workers of the future. </p>
<p>“Young people are not expected to be vaccinated ahead of the May polls, which makes postal vote sign-up critical. In the Midlands, we have some really important elections with the hopes of a new West Midlands Mayor in Liam Byrne and a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner in Simon Foster, the region has a real opportunity to change its future and make it a bright one for everyone who lives and works here.” </p>

              <h3>Robin Walker (Worcester)</h3>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Worcester’s MP has paid tribute to HRH the late Duke of Edinburgh and recalled his visit to the faithful city during the Queen’s diamond jubilee in 2012 to open the Hive. The Worcester MP, Robin Walker has spoken of his three meetings with the Prince Philip and how he always showed a dynamism, wit and kindness.</p>
<p>As Parliament sits today for tributes to be paid to an incredible man at the end of a long and fruitful life, Robin has pointed out how his desire to give young people the best chance in life leaves a lasting legacy. Speaking after the sad news of the Duke Of Edinburgh’s passing, Robin Walker MP said:</p>
<p>“This has been an extraordinary life well lived. As a war hero in the Navy, as the world and our country’s longest living consort to a Queen, as the rock of support for our longest serving monarch in her duties at home and around the world and as a dutiful member of the Royal Family, Prince Philip has made an incredible contribution to our country, to the Commonwealth and its history over well over seventy five years of public service.</p>
<p>“For any individual to live to ninety nine and to keep working into their nineties is remarkable but for someone who has bourne such a burden of public service is even moreso. As we heard the sad news of his passing my first thoughts were with her Majesty the Queen for whom he has been such a source of strength. I know that my constituents across the faithful city will be thinking of the Royal Family and all his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren as we join them in mourning.”</p>
<p>“I was very lucky to have met the Duke on a number of occasions and on each he had the capability to light up a room. I first met him when I was a small child of eight or nine at the Royal Welsh show when my father was Secretary of State for Wales, I had been carefully primed to address him as your Royal Highness but in the excitement of the moment I completely forgot to do so. He was charm personified and made no fuss but joked with me in such a friendly matter that I was immediately put at ease. Many years later I was invited as newly elected MP to a palace garden party at Buckingham Palace and he was again laughing and joking all the way around the visitors there, I told him that my office was in Old Scotland Yard and he explained that it took its name from where the Kings of Scotland used to stay on their visits to London, then joked “and sometimes we let them go again afterwards”. The third time and the most special was during the diamond jubilee year when he and the Queen came to Worcester to open the Hive. Everyone who met him that day attested to a larger than life personality, a great charm and an immediate wit, focused on putting people at their ease. I now realise more than ever what an incredible privilege it was to be presented both to the sovereign and to such a remarkable man who has been her strength and support. I also know from my work in Northern Ireland that so many places all over our United Kingdom have fond memories of his visits.”</p>
<p>“The whole country owes this extraordinary man a debt of gratitude for his service but also for his remarkable legacy. His creation of the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme for young people has created so many memorable experiences and done so much to support young people in undertaking volunteering, learning about the great outdoors and building character and resilience. In a very real way his legacy will live beyond him in so many lives enhanced and people inspired. Whilst as a Minister of State, I will not have the opportunity to speak in today’s commons debate, I am looking forward to hearing the tributes from the Prime Minister and others who speak today and I consider it a privilege to have served in the Government and the Parliament of the second Elizabethan age that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has done so much to shape.”</p>

<p>As the vaccine rollout continues across Birmingham we can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel after what has been a truly difficult year for all of us.</p>



<p>We all know someone whose health or employment has been affected by the events of the past 12 months, and as we look to the end of the covid restrictions I&#8217;m determined to see the government provide Birmingham with the support it needs to rebuild its healthcare and employment capacity.</p>



<p>While the numbers of covid patients is decreasing, our NHS will have a mountain to climb to provide care for those with other conditions whose treatment has been deferred. Recent figures show 300,000 patients now waiting a year or more to receive care as a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Please don&#8217;t hesitate to&nbsp; contact me in the coming months if you have been affected by these issues and I can help in any way.</p>



<p><strong>Birmingham Coronavirus Update</strong></p>



<p>Following the first stage of the unlocking process, the following changes to the coronavirus restrictions came into effect on the 8th March:</p>



<ul><li>Wraparound childcare and other supervised children’s activities can resume where they enable parents to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group</li><li>Care home residents will be allowed one regular visitor provided they are tested and wear PPE</li><li>The Stay at Home requirement will remain, but people can leave home for recreation outdoors such as a coffee or picnic with their household or support bubble, or with one person outside their household</li><li>Some university students on practical courses will be able to return to face to face learning&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Call for an independent inquiry into the Government&#8217;s handling of the pandemic</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="430" src="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update.jpeg 1000w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-300x129.jpeg 300w, https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/liam-update-768x330.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Alongside my fellow Birmingham Labour MPs and Council leader Ian Ward, I have called for a full independent public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.</p>



<p>Many residents have raised this issue with me, and want to know why the UK had the highest death rates in the world and whether these deaths were preventable. I believe we have a duty to those who have lost loved ones to ensure a full, independent, and transparent investigation into how our country has handled the pandemic.</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;The pandemic has undoubtedly presented unprecedented challenges to governments around the world. There has not been a crisis like this is living memory and combatting this deadly virus was always going to be difficult. However, it must be acknowledged that the UK has seen one of the highest death tolls in the world and questions are now rightly being asked about what led us to this position.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>You can read the full letter <a href="https://liambyrnemp.co.uk/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Rt%20Hon%20B%20Johnson%20Prime%20Minister.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Support for a nurses pay rise</strong></p>



<p>Over the past year our health workers have given everything while under historic pressure to save lives and cope with the huge number of extra patients in our hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all they&#8217;ve been through it cannot be right that the 12,289 nurses in Birmingham have been offered a real terms pay cut by the government. We must do better for them than that, after all they&#8217;ve done for the country there must be a fair pay settlement.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been encouraged to show our appreciation throughout this crisis, but claps don&#8217;t pay the bills. I sincerely hope that the government will reconsider its recommended 1% pay increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Celebrating St Patrick&#8217;s Day</strong></p>



<p>This St Patrick’s Day was unlike any other in generations.</p>



<p>Coming from an Irish family, I saw the great solidarity and cohesion of the Irish community in Britain. It is heart-warming to witness this togetherness reaffirm itself during these challenging times.</p>



<p>I hope that all members of the Irish community in Hodge Hill found a way to mark the day, and that next year we will be able to come together as usual!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fighting to safeguard employment</strong></strong></p>



<p>Second only to the health impact of Coronavirus is its impact on the economy and employment. That is why I&#8217;ve written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for a £7.8 billion Budget ‘fair share funding’ boost for our area to tackle the jobs crisis.</p>



<p>Businesses need help to bounce back from the Covid crisis, and we must do every we can to support them by extending the furlough scheme in a targeted way, extending business interruption and bounce back loans, enabling interest free deferral of VAT, and extending targeted business rate relief.</p>

Who would have thought at the beginning of last year that, in only a few months’ time, we’d be in a nation-wide lockdown to protect ourselves from a global pandemic? It’s been tough on everyone – keeping apart from loved ones, not going out to work, studying and learning from home. Businesses have been placed under enormous pressure, many of which are only still going today on account of the generous support the government has provided in the form of staff furloughs and other grants and loans.</p>
<p>Most tragically of all, we all know people who have lost friends and family. And we mourn them all.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also aspects of the last year we will look back on with pride. The way Welwyn Hatfield has pulled together. The resilience our local NHS staff have shown when working at any and all hours in the battle against this virus. Local charities and volunteers like Sarah Jamieson of Resolve, who literally moved in with the homeless people she was helping to find accommodation during lockdown. And, of course, all those involved in the Herculean effort that is our vaccination roll-out, some of whom I had the pleasure of meeting when I had my first jab at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One year and three lockdowns later, the remarkable rollout of our vaccine programme means that we’re now able to look forward to a cautious but final route back to normality. Well over 50% of all adults in the UK have now been vaccinated &#8211; no other major economy in the world has vaccinated its population faster. We know it will take time for things to get back to normal, but thanks to the fortitude of the people of Welwyn Hatfield, as well as the hard work of our scientists, our brilliant NHS workers, our military and the army of volunteers across the entire country, we are embarking upon the journey to recovery.</p>

<p>Judith, alongside Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of the council and Tracy Brabin, candidate for West Yorkshire Mayor, has called for the Government to ensure there is a Northern Powerhouse Rail stop in the city centre.</p>



<p>Representing all three of Bradford&#8217;s Labour MPs, Judith said: &#8220;There is a world out there that would open up with an NPR stop here in Bradford city centre.</p>



<p>“It would increase our opportunities for job search, it would mean our businesses thrive.</p>



<p>“It’s a massive deal for Bradford, I can’t think of anything bigger at the moment.”</p>

<p>The SNP has criticised the UK government over its damaging Brexit deal, after new research revealed that three-quarters of UK firms are struggling with Brexit bureaucracy and delays.</p>
<p>In a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies, 74% said they are facing Brexit-related delays. Meanwhile, over half (51%) have said this has led to increased costs, and one in five are losing potential business.</p>
<p>Commenting, the SNP’s Shadow International Trade spokesperson Drew Hendry MP said:</p>
<p>“Barely a few months into the UK’s new post-Brexit trading relationship and already the damage being inflicted upon businesses is clear.</p>
<p>“With three-quarters of surveyed firms warning that Brexit bureaucracy and checks are leading to delays, and over half stating that they are now facing extra costs, it is businesses that are being forced to pay the heavy price for the Tories’ bad Brexit deal.</p>
<p>“Time and time again, analysis has shown that Brexit will leave us poorer and worse off – with firms facing Brexit red tape, checks and delays, and a significant number of them looking to bail from Britain and set up shop in the EU instead.</p>
<p>“Scotland can do so much better. It&#8217;s clear beyond any doubt that the only way to properly protect our businesses, economy and place in Europe, is to become an independent country – and that starts with both votes SNP in the upcoming Holyrood elections in May.”</p>

	<p>Steve Reed has asked Croydon Council to listen to local people over the future of South Norwood Library.  The library’s future is uncertain because the Conservative Government has cut funding to Croydon by 70% and pushed it into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Local MP Steve Reed has spoken to residents and campaign groups who are fighting to save the library.  He’s now written to the Council asking them to consider how closing the library will affect the areas poorest residents who may not have access to WiFi or quiet spaces for learning or reading at home.  He’s also asked the Council to fully involve the local community before taking any decisions.</p>
<p>Steve Reed said: &#8220;Croydon Council is faced with some really difficult decisions after ten years of Conservative funding cuts.  But they do not have to go it alone. Now more than ever people want a say over what happens in their area. The Council should harness this enthusiasm and work with residents to come up with plan that could protect library services for South Norwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recently coordinated a cross party <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EmmaLewellBuck/status/1362465057054076930?s=20">letter</a> with Robert Halfon MP which gathered almost 100 signatures across both Houses in support of my School Breakfast Bill.</p>



<p>As a result of the reduced parliamentary calendar during lockdown, my Bill has been indefinitely postponed. However, with child food insecurity rising and the educational attainment gap growing, there is now an urgency for this Bill.</p>



<p>I am deeply concerned that the Government’s National School Breakfast Programme reaches just 7% of the schools meeting the government’s own eligibility criteria and that funding will end altogether in July 2021. This will leave thousands of children without access to the free school breakfast they have come to rely on.</p>



<p>The proposed School Breakfast Bill would address this issue. The Bill proposed scaling up school breakfast funding to all the 8,700 schools with high levels of disadvantage in England. The Bill also proposed making support to schools permanent at a cost of just over £300m annually. This could be funded by the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) which continues to raise approximately £340m each year. In addition to this, research from Sustain has found more than £700m raised from the Levy since 2018 is unaccounted for. The unspent SDIL revenue can be allocated towards scaling up school breakfast provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really hope the Government accepts our proposals in the School Breakfast Bill so that every child at risk of hunger can have a free, nutritious school breakfast and be ready to start their day of learning.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning behind abstaining from the vote in Parliament on Wednesday (30/12) as the Governments’ Brexit deal returned to the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">From the outset, I have sought to respect the decision of the referendum in 2016 and have been happy to work with colleagues in Parliament to deliver a compromise between those 16 million people who voted to remain in the EU, and the 17 million who voted to leave with the myriad of different options that would entail. It has become clear to me over the last 4 years that many people who voted to leave the EU in Gateshead, did so for very different reasons and with very different expectations of our future relationship ranging from close alignment like Norway, to what has now been termed a hard Brexit, essentially no formal trading relationship with the European Union, operating on basic WTO rules instead. I was re-elected to represent Gateshead at the last General Election on the pledge to respect the result of the referendum and to negotiate a deal that would meet the 6 key tests.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">It would seem that successive Conservative Prime Ministers have seem set on rail-roading their respective deals through Parliament without proper scrutiny our accountability, and this week is no different. It appears to be the case that the Government may have sought to hold out for demands within the negotiations that they knew could not be agreed, around fishing quotas as an example, knowing that once these demands were dropped a deal could be agreed between both sides. They have then sought to drop these demands as Parliament goes into recess for the Christmas period, and bring back a deal of some 1200 pages for 5 hours of debate at 3 working days’ notice; 48 hours before the UK would end the transition period with no deal if this was not agreed.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The deal itself does not satisfy the 6 key tests I was elected on, and the way in which the Government appear to have manipulated the Parliamentary calendar to force MP’s into a vote quite literally between this deal or no deal, brings great shame on any type of Parliamentary Sovereignty. What we now have in the UK is Government sovereignty without proper input or scrutiny from democratically elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">To this end, I found that while a deal, even this deal, is better than a no deal, I could not in good conscience vote in favour of a deal which did not satisfy the key tests in the manifesto on which I was elected, and in essence to vote to help the Government extricate themselves from a mess entirely of their own making. It is the Government who have sought to negotiate this deal alone, it is they who have forced the timetable for approval and who have removed any Parliamentary Sovereignty and scrutiny from the timetable and it is the Government who must be judged on the success or failure of this deal.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As a local resident of Gateshead for over 40 years, I absolutely hope that this deal goes far enough to safeguard jobs and livelihoods of families across the North East. I also hope that this does not lead to shortage of supplies or price increases. This affects us all, and in many ways I do not wish the Government deal to fail to protect us from any negative consequences of it. However, with the way the whole process has been manipulated to force MP’s into a corner, and with the deal not meeting the 6 key tests set out in the manifesto on which I was elected, I could not see fit to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This is the Conservative Government’s deal, their deliberate mismanagement has brought it to Parliament, on a timetable manufactured by them, with no time for appropriate scrutiny, it’s their deal and they should own it!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I hope this sets out my reasoning, as ever please do get in touch should you have any further questions.</p>

<p><em>Dear Constituent,</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my December email newsletter. I know this year has been incredibly difficult for many families, and will continue to be very challenging, especially given the new variant of Covid, but the rollout of vaccines and community testing, which are gathering pace in Derbyshire, gives some hope for the new year. I&#8217;m sure, like me, you particularly welcome today&#8217;s announcement of the approval of the Oxford vaccine for rollout in our communities. Under these challenging circumstances, I nevertheless wish you a very safe and happy new year in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heanor Future High Streets Fund bid success &#8211; £8.5 million:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following Heanor&#8217;s bid towards the Government&#8217;s £830 million Future High Streets Fund, I&#8217;m delighted that Heanor has been successful and has been awarded over £8.5 million to help transform its town centre and recover from the pandemic. You can find the full details of the Borough Council&#8217;s bid <a href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ambervalley.gov.uk/business/future-high-street-fund/">here</a>, which focuses on plans to regenerate the Market Place and Grammar School site. The Council now have a few months to confirm the final version of their plans, and I look forward to continuing to support and work with them to ensure we can maximise this funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brexit deal latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Prime Minister reached a deal with the EU regarding our future relationship after the end of the transition period, from the 1st January 2021. Parliament has been recalled today, on the 30th December, to consider the deal and vote on it. You can read the deal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union">here</a> and the legislation enabling it <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0236/20236.pdf">here</a>. The select committee on the Future Relationship with the EU on which I serve has published a report on the deal this morning, which you can read <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/" data-cke-saved-href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/366/committee-on-the-future-relationship-with-the-european-union/news/138129/announcement-of-euuk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-allows-no-deal-to-be-averted-but-significant-change-still-imminent-says-committee/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can confirm I will be supporting the deal when it comes to a vote later.</p>
<p>Many constituents have contacted me throughout the negotiation period, and I think this deal delivers on the key areas whilst also providing certainty and security for businesses and residents already impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>This deal delivers on Brexit, the referendum and last year&#8217;s election result by taking back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8211; there is no role for the European Court of Justice and no requirement for the UK to follow EU law, so <strong>regaining parliamentary sovereignty</strong>;</p>
<p>&#8211; we will <strong>trade with the EU on the basis of zero tariffs and zero quotas</strong>, which will allow businesses to be able to trade smoothly and continue to access EU markets;</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Allows us to introduce our own modern subsidy system. </strong>This new subsidies system will operate in a that best suits the interests of UK industries &#8211; outside the EU State Aid regime.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> offers streamlined <strong>co-operation on law enforcement</strong>, ensuring we continue to effectively tackle serious organised crime and counter terrorism, protecting the public, and bringing criminals to justice. It also provides for future cooperation between the UK and EU on emerging security challenges, such as cyber and health security, including continuing to work together on tackling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong>- Recognises UK sovereignty over our fishing waters and puts us in a position to rebuild our fishing fleet and increase quotas, overturning the inequity that British fishermen have faced for over four decades. </strong>By the end of the five year transition we will have full control of our waters and the amount of fish available to UK fishermen will have risen from half to two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><strong>- Provides for the UK’s participation in certain EU programmes, furthering our commitment to making the UK a science and research superpower. </strong></strong>This deal will fulfil our manifesto commitment to participate in the Horizon Europe programme, but also the Euratom Research and Training programme, and the space programme, Copernicus.</p>
<p>The deal also includes arrangements for airlines and hauliers that provides them with certainty, and gives people the ability to travel to and from the EU easily for work and holidays; a social security agreement that has practical benefits for UK citizens including accessing healthcare when travelling in the EU; and agreements on energy which will benefit consumers by helping to keep prices down.</p>
<p>As I set out in previous newsletters, compromises were necessary to achieve a deal, especially on fishing and the level playing field. Having been through the deal I am satisfied that these compromises are acceptable in the context of the importance of tariff free access to the EU market. This is a good deal achieved at great speed and gives us the best possible platform to make a success of Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coronavirus guidance latest:</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the last review of the tier restrictions on 16 December, Amber Valley and all of Derbyshire remained in the tier 3 restrictions. The next review takes place today. Amber Valley currently has a high case rate, of 332 cases per 100k, which is one of the highest in Derbyshire, and up 44% on the previous week. This is a very concerning situation and may lead to further restrictions being out in place locally.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mass testing has started in Swadlincote in the south of the County and will spread further in the county, including to Amber Valley early in the new year. This programme, along with similar roll outs in health, care and school settings will help identify cases earlier and slow the spread.</p>
<p>Vaccines are also now starting to be rolled out across the County, and I&#8217;m pleased that Ripley is one of the first primary care centres to begin rolling out the vaccine, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.derbyandderbyshireccg.nhs.uk/news/news-articles-2020/derbyshire-gps-plan-to-open-first-vaccination-sites-in-dronfield-and-ripley/">here</a>. Now that the Oxford vaccine has been approved for us, the roll out of vaccination should increase rapidly at dedicated centres as well as local GPs and pharmacies. Please do wait to be contacted about the vaccine though rather than asking your GP.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in this pandemic with cases rising rapidly and the problems of 2 new variants. But the end is in sight now we can rapidly vaccinate the most vulnerable. At this time we all need to show as much caution as possible to reduce the number of cases and minimise the new restrictions needed. We’ve got this far, let’s not ease off now.</p>
<p>I will continue to engage with ministers, the public health team and the local NHS to ensure that this area sees the full roll out of the vaccines and mass testing as soon as possible and that support is in place for those who can’t work and those businesses forced to close as a result of the tier measures.</p>
<p>You can read my contributions in Parliament here including on highlighting the need to roll out the vaccine to people who are unable to leave their homes as soon as logistics allow <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-08b.715.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g725.4">here</a> and about consideration of more localised geography for tier restrictions <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2020-12-14b.23.0&amp;s=speaker%3A24965#g32.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Easy level: information courses. The main goal is to inform employees and tell how to use the acquired knowledge in work. For example, to get acquainted with a new product of the company. There may not be a hero and a plot. Therefore, in the scenario it is enough to describe on which slide what to tell: for example, on the first &#8211; about the main characteristics of the product, on the second &#8211; about the advantages over competitors.</p>



<p>Intermediate level: motivational courses. The main goal is to motivate employees to change their approach to work or attitude to something. For example, staff do not follow fire safety rules in the workplace, and you need to motivate employees.</p>



<p>In such courses, the character works well &#8211; involves in training. In the material about fire safety, a fire instructor will look logical. He will tell you what the neglect of the rules leads to and how to avoid an emergency. It is also important to add more practical assignments.</p>



<p>Difficult level: training course. The main goal is to pump up an old skill or develop a new one. There must be a history. Here it is important to think about the plot, the conflict, the place and time of the action, the main character and more.</p>



<p>Below I will tell you how to write a script for a training course. If you take this height, it is easy to handle tasks easier.</p>



<p>The results of the step: you have determined what type of course will best solve the tasks.</p>

<p>None of us wanted these new restrictions, and the Government has done everything in its power to avoid them.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister said on Saturday night, we understand the huge impact further restrictions have on jobs, on livelihoods and on people’s mental health.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic we have sought to protect our businesses and limit the intrusions on personal liberty as much as possible. For those of us who came into politics to help hardworking people and small businesses to thrive, it is heartbreaking to place these burdens upon them. For those of us who value personal freedom deeply, it pains us to inhibit it in this way.</p>
<p>But the data left us with no choice, but to take this course of action and introduce new restrictions until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As Local Government Secretary, I strongly believe that we were right in pursuing a local and regional approach to tackling this virus. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions and the local leaders who have stepped up to deliver this approach. Councils and local leaders have done wonderful work to help tackle the virus in their areas, and I firmly believe that in the longer term that is the approach that works best.</p>
<p>That’s why after we ease restrictions on 2nd December we are planning to continue with a local approach according to the latest data and trends.</p>
<p>But for now, the stark reality is that infections, hospitalisations and deaths continue to double, meaning that the virus is now a national problem.</p>
<p>The NHS and its workforce is weeks from being placed in an impossible situation. And those concerns are shared by our NHS colleagues from rural Cornwall to Nottingham to Newcastle. And a significantly higher death toll than the first wave is now predicted without taking further restrictions. We owe it to the country to act, and to act swiftly.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a decision that any responsible leader would make when presented with the new medical evidence last week and will set out his plans to parliament ahead of a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-Covid healthcare can continue as normal – so that you can continue to use the NHS for your treatments, appointments and scans.</p>
<p>And the furlough scheme has been extended for a further month, covering 80% of employees’ wages. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have always been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>These are tough national measures, but they are different from those in the Spring. Our schools, colleges and universities remain open and we should resist those who would close them. As a parent I know there is simply no substitute for face to face teaching and our children’s education must not be set back again.</p>
<p>Unlimited exercise outdoor is permitted and single person households can form a support bubble. Children under school age who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside, meaning that a parent can see a friend or family member with their baby or young children, and children and adults who are dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will also be included in this exemption. Churches and places of worship will remain open,  providing solace and comfort for people, albeit for private prayer rather than communal worship.</p>
<p>If you can work from home you should, but if not, you can and should go to work, following the relevant guidance for your workplace. Too many jobs and businesses have been lost already, with all the harm that comes with that, so we must do everything we can to keep working and we in Government will do all we can to support you.</p>
<p>As Housing Secretary, I can confirm that the housing market will remain open throughout this period as will construction sites, building the homes and sustaining the jobs we desperately need. Tradespeople like plumbers and electricians can come into your home as long as they follow social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>Those we previously asked to stay at home and shield, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be given new guidance shortly that will be less restrictive. But nonetheless they should continue to be cautious.</p>
<p>These changes are important to protect our way of life and our livelihoods, but I am under no illusion that the things people really want to do are hug their grandchildren, finally have the postponed wedding or simply share a cup of tea with old friends. But it is by taking these tough decisions now that we will get through this together.</p>
<p>Members of the public have shown incredible forbearance, patience and dignity in responding to this unique situation, and shown the character that has always been present in this country at moments of great challenge.</p>
<p>Amidst this winter gloom, there are rays of light piercing through and raising our eyes to the horizon. We know more about this virus with every day that passes and there are ever better medicine and therapies, along with the realistic chance of a vaccine being available for those that need it most in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>We expect to have quick turnaround tests that will tell you whether or not you have the virus very soon – with a massive expansion of these planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These are reasons for optimism – but there is no denying that there are hard days ahead of us.</p>
<p>But by acting now, it is our hope that families across the country can be together for Christmas.</p>
<p>So, from Thursday: rejoin in a further national effort to protect the NHS, save lives and move forward together.</p>

<p>I am delighted to write and tell you that local NHS leaders have confirmed plans for a new hospital to be built in Sutton and to upgrade facilities at St Helier. This represents a <strong>£500 MILLION plan</strong> that will not only <strong>build a brand new state of the art hospital</strong> near to the Royal Marsden by 2025, but ALSO <strong>invest AT LEAST £80 MILLION into upgrades at St Helier</strong>.</p>



<p>The new specialist emergency care hospital, just a few minutes from St Helier, would treat the sickest 15% of patients, those normally arriving by ambulance. This larger specialist team would be available 24 hours a day to diagnose what is wrong with patients more rapidly, start the best treatment faster, and help patients recover more quickly. St Helier and Epsom Hospitals will remain open 24/7, with updated and improved facilities, providing all the other services that they currently do.</p>



<p>My children were born at St. Helier so healthcare provision in Sutton has been an issue that is a very personal one to me. Ever since being a councillor in Carshalton, some 14 years ago, I have been campaigning for a solution that protects the future of St. Helier whilst ensuring that Sutton residents have access to the very best treatment in cutting edge modern healthcare facilities. I believe that this decision can finally put to rest the political arguments so that we can get on with doing what’s best for residents across the whole of the borough of Sutton.</p>



<p><strong>With this plan, the refurbished St Helier Hospital is here to stay providing the majority of local health services, and the sickest patients will get state-of-the-art treatment in the brand-new specialist emergency hospital right here in our area.</strong></p>



<p>You can find out more about the plans, including the answers to some frequently asked questions at the NHS’ website: <a href="http://www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">www.improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>. You can also contact them at <a href="mailto:hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk">hello@improvinghealthcaretogether.org.uk</a>, or get in touch with me with any queries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Why is this being done?</u></strong></p>



<p>To improve the care that we receive. As St Helier’s buildings continue to age over time, it’s necessary to upgrade our healthcare facilities to improve outcomes. Surviving illness and recovering quickly is the number one priority.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier closing?</u></strong></p>



<p>No, quite the opposite. St Helier is here to stay with a multi-million-pound improvement package.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is a new hospital being built?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. A new specialist emergency care hospital will be built in Sutton, in addition to improving St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Is St Helier getting an upgrade?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. At least £80 million of the funding promised will go towards improving the facilities at St Helier hospital.</p>



<p><strong><u>Who developed these proposals?</u></strong></p>



<p>For the first time, we have a plan that was developed by local clinicians, not national bureaucrats or politicians. Local healthcare professionals made the case for funding to deliver this improvement, which has been rewarded with a £500 million investment. Sutton Council also supported the proposals last year.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will I have to travel outside my area for services now?</u></strong></p>



<p>At the moment, if you have a stroke or heart attack you will be taken past St. Helier to be treated at St. George&#8217;s. This plan means that we will still be able to treat people within the local area, not moving more services away from Sutton.</p>



<p><strong><u>Will we still use St Helier?</u></strong></p>



<p>Yes. From 2025, Epsom hospital, St Helier hospital and the new hospital at Sutton will all have a 24/7 Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) (which already treats the vast majority of people going to St. Helier in an emergency). Under the plans, 85% of services will remain at St Helier. Both Epsom and St Helier hospitals will still have a 24/7 UTC.</p>



<p>Diagnostic tests, such as MRI, x-ray or ultrasound, the heart problem diagnosis unit, the dialysis unit, Croft Ward (which takes care of patients who are stable but not ready to leave hospital), the eye care unit, the gastroenterology unit, and so many more services are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about bed numbers?</u></strong></p>



<p>The NHS have calculated that they will need the same number of beds as they do now.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about A&amp;E?</u></strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous plans, which saw A&amp;E diverted away into Tooting, A&amp;E is now staying right here in our Borough at the new hospital. Most of the time you will still use St Helier for matters requiring immediate medical attention like broken limbs or cuts. Major trauma cases needing a blue light ambulance transfer will be treated in Sutton at the new state-of-the-art hospital next to The Royal Marsden.</p>



<p><strong><u>What about maternity services?</u></strong></p>



<p>Maternity services have also been protected and kept locally. Post-natal and ante-natal care are staying put at Epsom and St Helier hospitals, and births will take place in the brand-new maternity unit at the new hospital in Sutton built to the very latest healthcare standards. Women need the very best care and facilities when giving birth, and the new plans will provide that.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will children services be provided?</u></strong></p>



<p>Most children will continue to receive care and treatment in the same place as they do now. Care for children who need to stay in hospital overnight – as a result of a serious illness or complex problems – will be treated at the new specialist emergency care hospital. This includes children’s surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><u>What will happen until the new hospital in Sutton is built?</u></strong></p>



<p>All services will continue to be carried out at Epsom and St Helier hospitals until such time the new hospital in Sutton is ready for patients.</p>



<p><strong><u>Where will the new hospital be built?</u></strong></p>



<p>After consulting residents, patient groups and healthcare professionals, the decision was taken to build a brand-new specialist emergency care hospital in Sutton. This will be combined with the necessary infrastructure and transport links to ensure the site of the new hospital is accessible to all that need to use it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;E @ the Glam &#8211; Strength in Unity</strong></p>
<p>I have said from the very beginning that if we are to ensure a 24 hour A&amp;E Service at RGH then we need to forget about Party Politics, and come together to work cross-party.</p>
<p>We need you to play your part too, by signing the below letter. If you wish to do so then please let me know by filling in the form at the bottom of this page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The configuration of Emergency NHS services across Cwm Taf Morgannwg has changed over the years – and will continue to change along with medical advances and changes in the local population. We welcome, for instance, the development of the new Major Trauma Centre at UHW, which will almost certainly save lives and we recognise that for some specialist forms of care it will be necessary to travel to a regional centre of excellence such as the Burns Unit at Morriston. We also understand that there is a UK-wide shortage of Emergency Consultants. and that Cwm Taf Morgannwg is not in a unique position with the recruitment challenges it faces,but would note that 5 of the 7 LHBs in Wales have substantially increased emergency consultant numbers over the last 6 years whereas Cwm Taf Morgannwg has not. We would argue that the uncertainty created over the future of the hospital due to the South Wales Programme has itself created a self-fulfilling prophecy about recruitment problems.</p>
<p>Our starting point, however, is that all NHS services should be safe, efficient and delivered as close to people’s homes as is medically and logistically feasible. Time-critical medical interventions can make the difference between life and death in many emergency situations and we are concerned that if the A&amp;E were permanently to close at any one of the three hospitals, significant numbers of patients in some of the most deprived communities would not be able to get to an Emergency Department in time. A&amp;E cannot be seen in isolation from other services such as GP surgeries, local minor injuries units and out-of-hours support. Additional capacity in these services would almost certainly lighten the load in the Emergency Departments, but this must be put in place before any changes to the configuration of Emergency Care is considered, let alone implemented, with evidence that they have substantially reduced the load on Emergency departments required before any changes. Changes to A&amp;E provision at any one of the hospitals would have serious implications for other services within the hospital, including ITU and theatre and might harm the recruitment of other specialists.</p>
<p>There would be significant knock-on effects if the A&amp;E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital were to be downgraded to a Minor Injuries Unit, as the hospital would almost certainly lose its Intensive Care Unit and operating theatre. This could jeopardise the long-term future of the hospital. The RGH’s Emergency Department is the most used in the area, with roughly 65,000 attendances a year, and ranked the best in terms of viable outcomes.  We fear the two other Emergency Departments would find it impossible to cope with the additional workload and that many patients will travel instead to UHW, which is also already over-stretched. We are also concerned that extra A&amp;E admissions to PCH and POW would put additional pressure on not just their respective A&amp;E depts but onwards and throughout the hospital system. We are determined to work with people of all political parties and trades unions (and none) to get the best possible outcome for the communities we represent. We believe the eventual decision should be informed by clinical best practice and local experience on the ground – and not by any partisan consideration.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to do the following:<br />
1) Rule out the closure of A&amp;E at the RGH or changing it to a 24-hour Minor Injuries Unit.<br />
2) Reinstate the option of maintaining a full consultant-led A&amp;E at all three hospitals. This would require a serious new attempt at recruiting Emergency Consultants who would have secure full-time permanent posts working across all three hospitals. It would also require at least a ten-year commitment to RGH so that potential staff can apply with confidence.<br />
3) Bring forward proposals to extend the opening hours of the Minor Injuries Unit at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda and Ysbyty Cwm Cynon and make these units more readily accessible for walk-in patients.<br />
4) Bring forward other proposals for community health services, including improvements in the out-of-hours GP service, that might alleviate the pressure on all three A&amp;E departments<br />
and bring services closer to local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, we are calling on the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board to publish the following:<br />
1) A socioeconomic and equality impact assessment of any proposed changes.<br />
2) Detailed analyses of travel-to-hospital times, average ambulance response times and levels of car ownership, for all electoral wards in the area. that analyses such times during periods of poor weather.<br />
3) Detailed statistics for levels of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and infant and adult mortality for all electoral wards in the area. and how they compare with the Welsh averages/wealthier wards in Wales.<br />
4) An assessment of how many patients from each electoral ward would be affected by a proposal to move to an 8 to 8, and 8 to 10 and an 8 to midnight Emergency Department.<br />
5) An assessment of capacity in the Emergency Departments at POW, PCH, and UHW and how they would cope with additional patients.<br />
6) Statistics for the number of patients who are admitted on towards at each hospital from A&amp;E.<br />
7) An assessment of the impact to the Welsh Ambulance Service, Ambulance response times, handover response times, in terms of waiting times at hospitals, blue light trauma travel times<br />
and non-emergency transport between hospitals.</p>

Even though I never took this election &#8211; or any election &#8211; for granted, it is still a big blow to lose the seat I have represented for 27 years and which is [&#8230;]

<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party have reselected Lisa Nandy MP as their candidate for the next General Election.</p>



<p>At meetings held over the last fortnight, members in all of the branches that make up Wigan Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to reselect Lisa. All affiliated organisations, including Unite the Union, the Communication Workers&#8217; Union, GMB, Unison and Usdaw, also voted to reselect.</p>



<p>Lisa said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to Labour members in Wigan for choosing to reselect me so overwhelmingly. Being the Member of Parliament for Wigan is the privilege of my life, and I couldn&#8217;t do it without the members who turn up year in, year out and in all weathers to campaign for the Labour Party. With a General Election looking likely, we will be out once again fighting for every vote and to put an end to the damage inflicted on Wigan by this reckless Conservative government.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Wigan Constituency Labour Party said:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have reselected Lisa Nandy as our candidate for the next General Election. For 10 years Lisa has worked tirelessly to represent Wigan in Parliament, fighting for constituents hit hardest by this Conservative government&#8217;s brutal cuts and ensuring that Wigan&#8217;s voice is heard on the national stage. The overwhelming level of support Lisa received from local party members is testament to that work. We&#8217;re proud to have Lisa as our MP and we&#8217;re ready to fight and win the next General Election together.&#8221;</em></strong></p><p>The post <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/news/lisa-reselected-by-wigan-labour/" target="_blank">Lisa reselected by Wigan Labour</a> first appeared on <a href="http://www.lisanandy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Nandy MP</a>.</p>

I cannot wait to get back up to Westminster and be the voice for Swansea East.</p>

<p>A vote for the SNP is a vote to stand up for young people against the Tories, Mhairi Black has said, she urged young voters to use their voice in this Thursday’s election.<span id="more-127"></span><br />
In government, the SNP has protected and expanded the Education Maintenance Allowance which has been scrapped south of the border, and has abolished university tuition fees in Scotland while the Tories have increased them to £27,000.</p>
<p>The SNP has also increased the number of Modern Apprenticeships, with a target of 30,000 new starts by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>The SNP manifesto commits to a real Living Wage – projected to be just over £10 by the end of the parliament for all workers aged 18 and above – creating a new single adult rate.</p>
<p>SNP MPs will also support a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and will support votes at 16 at all elections.</p>
<p>Commenting, Mhairi Black said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote for the SNP is a vote for a strong team of MPs who&#8217;ll stand up for young people – calling for a fair and equal minimum wage, protecting rights in the workplace and votes at 16 in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SNP are already delivering for Scotland&#8217;s young people, delivering free university education and with youth unemployment at the lowest level on record – while the Tory vision is just cut after cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories think they can do anything they want to young people and get away with it – from hiking tuition fees to slashing housing benefit for young people and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that young people turn up and vote – don&#8217;t let the Tory government leave you behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will simply rubberstamp whatever the Tory government does to young people, and Labour can’t win this election in Scotland – meaning that voting Labour risks letting Tory MPs in by the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland. Only then can we protect Scotland from the dangers of an unopposed Tory government at Westminster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Here’s how strong SNP voices will stand up for young people at Westminster.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs won’t let the Tories trade away Scottish jobs in the Brexit negotiations &#8211; we will work to protect Scotland’s place in the Single Market.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will back a transition over the next parliamentary term towards payment of the real Living wage for all adults above the age of 18. This will mean a new single adult rate and will see the UK minimum wage to rise to the real Living Wage, projected to be just over £10.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will guarantee the continuation of free university education in Scotland, protecting students in Scotland from paying up to £27,000 of fees.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, we are mitigating the Tory decision to withdraw housing support from 18 to 21 year olds. We will fight for the restoration of this support across the UK, alongside scrapping the Bedroom Tax.</p>
<p>&#8211; SNP MPs will look to introduce our own legislative proposals to give 16 and 17 year olds a vote in all elections.</p>
<p>&#8211; In Scotland, youth unemployment is already at the lowest level on record. SNP MPs will support the devolution of employment and employability powers so we can extend our successful approach on youth employment.</p>
<p>&#8211; To help businesses create jobs, we will propose a doubling of the Employment Allowance – the discount businesses receive on National Insurance when they create jobs.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will press the UK government to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and to ensure that workers have appropriate rights and protections, including holiday and sick pay. And we will work to ensure that the rights and protections currently safeguarded by EU membership are not diminished.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will work to protect opportunities for young people to study and train in other European countries through the ERASMUS+ scheme.</p>
<p>&#8211; We will continue to work with Scotland’s universities and institutions to seek clarity from the UK government on what will replace EU research funding for Scotland’s universities.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Over recent days I&#8217;ve received hundreds of emails from local residents about the refugee crisis. It&#8217;s extremely heartening to know that so many of you not only share my anguish at the human cost of the crisis but agree with me that more needs to be done to help those seeking sanctuary from civil war, sectarian violence and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The crisis is one of the biggest humanitarian challenges that Europe has faced since the Second World War. It is therefore shameful that so far the Government’s &#8216;Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme,&#8217; begun in March 2014, has only assisted 216 Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>As a result of concerted public pressure the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to welcome more Syrian refugees to Britain. In my view his Government is right to prioritise the most vulnerable Syrians – victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people, and victims of torture living in camps across the Middle East – for resettlement and to argue that we need to redouble efforts to help tackle the traffickers and people smugglers who prey on people&#8217;s fear and desperation. However, given the scale and immediacy of the present crisis the pledge the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons on Monday, to receive only 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of the next five years, is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>The Government should think again about taking more refugees &#8211; both directly from Syria and from Southern European countries who are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The Prime Minister should also engage with EU leaders to agree a process for dealing with this crisis at Europe&#8217;s borders and work with local authority leaders across the UK to see what more can be done in our local communities to support refugees and asylum seekers.<br />
Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this issue while also supporting local efforts by the council, community groups and individual residents to help those in need.</p>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">A few things have recently been rattling around in my head which concern women in politics; I've been trying to gather some ideas as to why there aren't more of us, and how I might encourage female candidates to come forward. At the same time, I noticed that the launch of the <a href="http://www.countingwomenin.org/">Counting Women In campaign</a>, couldn't miss the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15451876">outrageous attack</a> on <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">Dr Eilidh Whiteford MP</a>, and I've been enjoying Winnie Ewing's very readable autobiography. I've also been out on the doorsteps for Ken Andrew in Hillhead.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">All of these together really say: the culture of politics in the UK is what's at fault. Women don't think it's for them and just disengage.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Now, obviously that's a generalisation. I'm a woman, and I'm very engaged in politics. <i>I'm prepared to accept I'm a bit odd.</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I chapped on a door the other week while canvassing. I had Alexander with me in the pram. A woman answered, I politely introduced myself and my purpose on her doorstep - she shook her head and told me she wasn't interested. I asked why. She firmly asserted that all politicians are just the same. I asked her if anyone from any political party had ever come to see her with a baby in a pram. She thought briefly, admitted that'd never happened, and sent me on my way.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm not sure whether that experience tells me whether I ought to a) leave the wee man at home or b) work on my doorstep pizzaz, but I bet that woman had opinions on all kinds of things. I don't think she believes them to be particularly political - provision of care services, or bin collection, say - but in the end they're determined by politicians. I want women like her to tell me what she wants and why it matters. More than that, I want women who care about issues to join political parties to further that cause. There are all kinds of causes promoted within the SNP, and I will most likely welcome you in.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I'm sure I've said before that I've always felt welcomed as a woman in the SNP, and that remains true. I'm not sure how Labour men treat women in general (<a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/editor-s-picks/city-councillor-is-sacked-over-rape-hearing-remarks-1.1089224">not great</a> <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/charges-dropped-against-councillor-1.1065376">by some accounts</a>, which appear to be <a href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13-councillors-lose-labour-appeal-1.1128955">no barrier to reselection</a>), but they're certainly not great at giving SNP women the respect they are due. <br /><br />I recalled hearing when Winnie's book came out that she had been bullied while at Westminster. The <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/people/mother_scotland_1_683301">Scotsman's 2007 interview put it thus:</a> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><i>As the lone SNP member in the Commons - at best an intimidating place  for an inexperienced politician - she found herself without friends,  without party colleagues, without any supporting structures. She was  completely alone. She was hundreds of miles from her husband and her  children in an excessively macho and very hostile environment. "I was  treated as the enemy, I was shunned and despised. It's a peculiar  experience to suddenly find yourself hated. At times I did feel terribly  lonely, close to despair."&nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Reading the autobiography, you really get a vivid picture of the pressure Winnie Ewing was under as an MP on her own. Her every action was scrutinised; if she didn't attend a debate, the other parties would ensure it got in the papers. The nuances of what said were taken apart. She was under political and personal attack from all sides and, even more sinister, stalked by another MP. Interventions by others had some impact, but it must have been a great emotional strain.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that when Winnie was appointed as an MEP (pre-democratic elections to Europe), the bad behaviour of two particular Labour bullies continued in the European Parliament when she was alone again, deliberately working to ridicule and undermine her for over a year. By the account in the autobiography, this only ended when the President of the Parliament intervened, threatening to have them withdrawn as being <i>"not fit to represent their country and Parliament in Europe"</i>.<br /><br /><br />You might think that, around forty years later, a female SNP MP might expect some kind of change to have occurred in attitudes, as with wider society. Women are accepted in a range of jobs, universities are gaining majorities of female students, there are innumerable opportunities and directions for careers. And then, there's Ian Davidson MP.<br /><br />Eilidh has written <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/eilidh_whiteford_we_need_to_stand_up_to_bully_boy_culture_1_1938114">a revealing article in the Scotland on Sunday</a> - I'd urge you to read the full article, but I think this small quote does illustrate the point perfectly:<br /><br /><i>"It does not matter that all I had done was disagree with the  committee. In fact what inspired Mr Davidson’s remark is utterly  irrelevant. There is no action, no misbehaviour that justifies the  threat or act of “a doing”. We hear too often of women being told they  were “asking for it” in justification for intimidation or violence. I  never expected to hear that from an MP in Parliament.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is  not simply an issue of aggression towards woman; it’s about a culture of  intimidation and bullying affecting men and women that seems to  flourish with impunity in the Westminster world."</i><br /><br />The tragedy is that it's primarily through this Westminster lens that the viewing population sees politics and politicians. They see argument, they see confrontation; they see crowds of boorish suits moaning a weary "hear hear". And they switch off. They say "that's not for me". <br /><br />They don't see a politician arguing the case with a housing association, trying to help a vulnerable tenant. They don't see someone working on a committee, trying to improve a policy that will help improve children's health. They don't see the joy that is presenting prizes to year groups of school students, with the hope that you can encourage them in that tiny second as you shake their hand. They don't know what a privilege it is to be invited into so many lives and homes, to meet with groups and organisations and offer what help you can.<br /><br />The work of politics should never be that yah boo nonsense that men excel at and so many women hate. More women should be in politics for the fantastic difference they can make every day.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
